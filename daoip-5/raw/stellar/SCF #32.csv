","Summary of what we have built & learned

In our Q4 2023 submission we built our MVP and tested demand with one cash in option as well as USDC on Stellar and Bitcoin payments; this validated interest on the product, and showed we could improve easiness.

In our July 2024 submission we added cards and three more countries for cash in, and saw usage improve importantly. We also migrated from a marketplace format to an online store for merchants, and that brought us more than 200% increase in sales.

See our growth chart for signups and transactions here: https://imgur.com/a/jh9WBd6

THIS SUBMISSION WORKPLAN:

Increase usage 3-fold and volume 5-fold by adding local payments, which will open doors to greatly grow USDC exchange via p2p

1.  Add local cash in method in Venezuela: Pago Móvil
    
    We currently only accept payments from abroad, but after doing a pilot in one location, we realized local payments are highly desired by users and estimate that we will increase our transaction count at least 3x! This will enable us to serve 100% of their clients and not just the 10% who actually are using it now from international purchases. 
    
1.  Work with our legal partners in order complete the set up of our legal entities in Venezuela and finetune Mexico in order have a frictionless connection to banking systems 
    
    Set up an entity that is connected to the banking system and can allow us to launch our pago móvil collection scheme in Venezuela, and submit additional documentation to comply with local requirements in Mexico.
    
1.  Build exchange module base for Venezuelan fiat-USDC exchange
    
    After we are able to receive local fiat, we will exchange this into USDC in order to protect from inflation. In order to do this we will build and connect a rate information tool that will enable to know the exchange rate in an inflation economy in order to get accurate data for every time money is collected and exchanged to USDC via p2p systems and the official rate shared by central bank.",https://whimsical.com/un-alivio-november-submition-5qbeaQcPbwFgvXcFsWUiiN,"We define success by measuring growth on three simple key metrics, and our ONE KING KPI:

Fabian previously founded Glufco, a P2P and payments solution tailored to Venezuela with over 15,000 users. Ernesto spearheaded Dash initiatives in LatAm, onboarding chains like Church’s Chicken and Excelsior Gama to accept crypto.

Unalivio's go to market plan is now focused on two key approaches:  

1.  Online Payments for Brick-and-Mortar: Simplifying online payment acceptance for retailers who want to sell online but previously could not do it . We let them have a balance of USDC on Stellar to avoid inflation.
    
1.  International Payments: Enabling merchants to transact cross-border payments through Unalivio, which is something they could not do at all previously.
    

We onboarded about a dozen merchants on a one by one basis, and plan to double this before we deploy automatic tools.

We are iterating our product with laser focus before we expand, in order to avoid wasting resources.

As part of our merchant onboarding we will be testing the cross border scheme with a community in Mexico, involving incentivized brand ambassadors to sign up and promote usage.

We will continue in-store promotions, cashier training, point-of-sale materials, and social media efforts, particularly via Instagram with our 5,000 followers on  https://www.instagram.com/somosunalivio/.

After completing deliverables on this proposal we aim to increase our total nr of sales between three to five times as a result of having local fiat payment and overall product improvements.","Since our July proposal we have ramped up growth by focusing on fine tuning our product and customer acquisition tactics.

We focused efforts on top merchants in 15 physical locations, serving 8,000+ client/Mo. In this ecosystem we’ve achieved triple-digit growth in signups per Q, surpassing 1,000 signups/month. We are now obsessed on conversions!

1.  71% signups growth per quarter.
    
1.  Average sales growth of 40% per Q
    
1.  We surpassed 1000 signups a month, now we will focus on conversions.

1.  Cumulative user base of 7k+ registrations (Average 30 signups/Day https://imgur.com/a/zx6Kxxj)
    

Our current customer acquisition focuses on a one-by-one process, which is ok for our current stage, and a process we will continue to use until we hit the 50 merchant mark.

Addressing Feedback from SCF31 Submission
---------------------------------------------

Following feedback from our SCF31 submission, the SocketFi team has implemented several improvements and changes:

Review of Project Budget and Scope

To address concerns regarding the project’s high budget and broad scope, we have adopted a streamlined approach to enhance focus and cost efficiency:

-   Clarified Objectives: SocketFi’s objectives were refined, prioritizing core goals and functionalities. Features have been categorized into essential, optional, and future enhancements. This allows us to focus on delivering critical functionalities first while deferring less urgent elements to later phases, simplifying development without compromising quality.
    
-   Optimized Budget: The budget was reassessed, itemizing all expenses and identifying high-cost areas. Cost-saving measures were adopted, including the use of open-source tools, existing frameworks, and outsourcing specific tasks.
    
-   Structured Development Process: A detailed roadmap, with clear deliverables, deadlines, and milestones, now structures the project, enabling efficient progress tracking.
    

These measures have successfully refined the project scope, optimized the budget, and established a focused, iterative development process, positioning the project for success.

SocketFi SDK and Enhanced User Experience

In response to feedback regarding the success dependency on the SocketFi dApp portal UI, we have expanded SocketFi into a service. With the development of the SocketFi SDK, a toolkit that allows Stellar-based projects to integrate the SocketFi wallet as a login option, users will be able to seamlessly connect to dApps through social login within the dApp's UI, significantly reducing reliance on the SocketFi portal for success.

Additionally, we have prioritized creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring an exceptional user experience with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.

To bolster user acquisition, we have implemented targeted strategies, including:

-   Partnerships within the Stellar ecosystem.
    
-   An incentivized community participation approach.
    
-   Engaging marketing campaigns.
    

These efforts will strengthen our user base and drive widespread adoption.

Ambitious ""Super App"" Vision with a Phased Rollout

While SocketFi is still in the development phase, positioning it as a ""super app"" is an ambitious goal. To achieve this, we have adopted a phased rollout strategy. Initially, we are focusing on core functionalities, including the SDK that allows dApps to independently integrate the SocketFi wallet. Over time, we will expand to include broader features, ultimately enabling users to access hundreds of dApps built on Soroban and Stellar from a unified platform.

Technical Clarification: Sending Funds Using Social Media Usernames

In the current version, users can send funds from accounts created with Twitter sign-in. However, they currently need to manually enter the recipient's wallet address. Future updates will enable fund transfers using usernames.

Our implementation utilizes an on-chain mapping system within the smart wallet that associates Twitter usernames (and other social platform identifiers) with Soroban smart contract addresses (smart accounts). This system ensures that when a user enters a recipient's Twitter handle (and other supported platform identifiers), it is securely mapped to the corresponding wallet address.

The mapping operates by storing username-address pairs in the main (controller) smart contract, which can be accessed through a smart contract function that securely resolves the username to its associated wallet address. To ensure security, only usernames linked to a smart accounts will be resolvable, protecting against impersonation and errors. More details on this implementation have also been included in our technical document.

Key Features and Benefits of SocketFi
-----------------------------------------

-   Convenience and Accessibility: Social media login streamlines account creation and access, eliminating the need for password management and encouraging broader adoption.

This makes it easier for users to find and interact with Stellar-based DeFi opportunities, improving accessibility for all experience levels.

AI Portfolio Builder: One Click’s AI will analyze user wallets, including Stellar-based assets, to recommend the best DeFi strategies. This helps users create portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and find yield opportunities within Stellar's ecosystem.

One-Click Zaps: This feature enables users to execute complex DeFi actions, like providing liquidity, on Stellar in one transaction. It simplifies cross-chain interactions and ensures that users can engage with Stellar-based DeFi pools effortlessly.

Gamified Yield Farming: One Click will introduce fun, interactive elements like automated airdrops and reward quests for Stellar-based DeFi. This engages users and encourages them to maximize returns on Stellar through a playful experience.

UPDATE since the previous SCF #30 submission of OneClick.Fi (Link to original submission: https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec83kMMeg4sWdkla)

Question 1: While the idea of earning yields from top protocols on other chains is interesting, it doesn’t appear to directly contribute to bringing liquidity into the Stellar ecosystem. Focusing on how to retain liquidity within Stellar or how the project can benefit Stellar-based protocols more clearly would help address this concern.  

Answer:

We will retain liquidity within Stellar and benefit Stellar-based protocols through the following products deployed by OneClick.Fi:

-   Yield Explorer - the frontend for exploring every DeFi pool on every protocol on Stellar network. Yield Explorer will directly showcase the yield pools of Stellar protocols, allow users to do their due diligence, and provide users simple access to the opportunities
    
-   Portfolio Builder - for users who don't know where to start in DeFi, they can use Portfolio Builder to create a customized/personalized portfolio of DeFi pools on Stellar. Newbie users use OneClick's Portfolio Builder and see the Stellar pools and protocols as the end result of their onboarding. This will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem
    
-   Airdrop Tracker + Stellar Spaces - we will create a dedicated ""Space"" for Stellar Ecosystem that will showcase the available protocols in Stellar Ecosystem, quests, giveaways, or other promotional campaigns available in the ecosystem. In the end, users will be able to see the ""Stellar Space"" with all the available campaigns and activities which will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem. 
    

You will find the links to demo of some of the features below as well as in the presentation.

  

And although OneClick.Fi delivers DeFi smoothness across a set of networks, additionally, the Stellar Network would be prioritized on the user interface in a variety of ways, for instance by:

-   Showing Stellar protocols and yield pools in the ""Featured"" section of Yield Explorer
    
-   Including Stellar opportunities as a one of the default options for the portfolio creation for Portfolio Builder
    
-   Putting Stellar Spaces in the front row / top of the UI for users to explore
    
-   Proactive banners and comparison of Stellar opportunities to other network opportunities
    
-   Etc. the exact details will be furnished
    
-   In addition to that, OneClick.Fi would partner with all the Stellar protocols/project (would need help from Stellar community with introductions) and organize educational campaigns to bring more awareness about the Stellar ecosystem. That would include:
    
-   Educational content (blog posts, threads, newsletters) about Stellar, protocols, and ecosystem around
    
-   AMAs with protocol founders/core team
    
-   Spaces, videos, podcasts with protocol founders/core team
    
-   ... And other activities that would bring more exposure to Stellar network. OneClick.Fi will essentially become Stellar's front page of DeFi as well as a global awareness machine with the goal of making people aware that there are cool things in Stellar DeFi and that it still exists (many crypto users don't even know that Stellar exists or is still alive after 2017-2018). We are here to change that in a simple, fun, and gamified way.
    

  

Question 2: Additionally, the deliverables are not well-organized, making it challenging to follow the development plan. A clearer breakdown of milestones and deliverables in a logical sequence would improve the proposal’s structure.

This project is a noncustodial Stellar wallet leveraging passkeys for enhanced security and ease of use. Freelii was originally built on Telegram and will be built on top of multiple socials as mini-apps to provide localized experiences to end users.,"Freelii is a re-branding and exploration on top of our original project - Strooper Wallet:

Strooper Github: https://github.com/JoseCToscano/strooper-wallet

Strooper Youtube Video: https://youtu.be/4faw_02YTBM

Freelii explores anchor integrations and Chatbot UX, but the key feature we want to focus on building prior to testnet is the Passkey login used in Strooper Wallet. We want to continue improving on this to make a ""one click"" verification.

We will combine the tech from Strooper and Freelii as we progress to mainnet.

Features and Stellar Integration:

1.  PassKeys for Secure Transactions (Strooper Technichal Architecture)  
    Stellar’s PassKeys enable secure transaction signing, making it easier and safer for users to manage their assets without dealing with private keys. Our main goal with these passkeys is to create a ""One Click Verification"" to create a frictionless experience.
    
1.  Peer-to-Peer Transfers (Freelii Technichal Architecture)  
    Users can scan a user’s address and send Stellar assets instantly within our wallet built on social platforms, offering fast, secure transfers directly in the chat.
    
1.  Anchor Integrations for On-Off Ramp (Freelii Technichal Architecture)  
    By integrating Stellar anchors, Strooper Wallet supports wallet top-ups and simple funds withdrawals, making it easier for users to move between crypto and traditional financial systems.
    

Impact of Improvements:

-   Security: PassKeys and Soroban smart contracts provide robust security and flexible asset management.
    

User Experience: Peer-to-peer transfers, customizable flows, and AI chatbot support enhance user convenience and streamline asset management.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1BsAcvzNs_WCv-Uta4chfI0ixqUKkX1/edit,"By the end of our first year, Freelii will aim to transact $250,000 a month. A comparable against an industry competitor. Where we want to win is sustained engagement with 50% active on a monthly basis. 

  

50,000 Users by end of year one. Why? A Fintech Monster like Revolut was able to attract 100,000 users in their first year of operations. For Freelii, 50,000 represents a balance between achievable growth and the need for user adoption in an increasingly competitive market. Coinbase and MetaMask saw significantly larger user growth rates after their first year but benefitted from being among the first in their categories.   

75% retention rate on onboarded customers. This benchmark is based on retention rates of successful wallets like MetaMask, which achieved similar retention rates due to strong product engagement.  

Impact:

Financial Inclusion: As more fiat users transition to crypto wallets, they gain access to global financial systems that were previously unavailable to them due to high fees, lack of infrastructure, or exclusion by traditional banks. For example, a user in a remote area could access savings, loans, and remittance services through Strooper without the need for a traditional bank account.",https://www.freelii.app/,https://github.com/JoseCToscano/freelii/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWXw0ZqOxlo,Yes,"Target Audience

Primary Market:

Viber Users: Viber is a widely-used messaging platform with millions of active users. In the Philippines it is estimated that 71% of Philippines population uses Viber worldwide. This is the fastest growing social platform - In 2021 the Viber traction was only 7%. We’ll focus on attracting existing Viber users who may have limited exposure to crypto but are interested in easy-to-use financial tools.

Primary Country Market: 

Targeting Philippines as our initial rollout country. In 2023, the Philippines received a record-breaking $37.2 billion in personal remittances, marking a 3.0% increase from $36.1 billion in 2022. Remittances account for over 8.5% of the countries GDP.

Secondary Market:

Stellar Community: The existing Stellar community will be a key early adopter group. We will actively engage with users already familiar with the Stellar ecosystem and Stellar-based DeFi tools.

Tertiary Market:

New DeFi Users: With the growing interest in decentralized finance, we will focus on users who are new to crypto and DeFi but are interested in simplified financial products like wallets, P2P transfers, and on-off ramp services.

Overall Market: 1.7 Billion underbanked people send hundreds of billions of dollars a year in unconventional ways, with 75% of payments being from outdated systems.

  

Value Proposition

Seamless Integration in Viber: No browser extensions, no separate app installations, just seamless access to Stellar's decentralised financial services for Viber users. 

Security and Simplicity: Leveraging PassKeys for secure transactions and removing the need for managing private keys will provide users with a safer, more user-friendly wallet experience. Low KYC needs.

Customizable and Automated: Our wallet offers customizable transaction flows through Soroban smart contracts, allowing users to automate asset management, bringing greater convenience to crypto transactions.

On-Off Ramp Services: By providing easy fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions through Stellar anchors, Freelii bridges the gap between traditional financial systems and crypto.

UX Focus: Creating social chatbots to help create familiarity to onboarding. Answer any questions pre-support needs, and help build comfort to any questions related to de-fi.

  

Acquisition channels:

  

Community Engagement

Stellar Ecosystem Partnerships: Collaborate with established Stellar-based projects and organizations to promote Strooper Wallet through joint campaigns and feature integrations.

Stellar Forums and Social Media: Engage with the Stellar community through Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, building excitement for the wallet’s launch.

  

Viber  User Base

Viber Ads and Bots: Leverage Viber’s advertising and bot ecosystem to run campaigns directly within the platform. Create demo bots for users to explore Freelii’s features before committing to use.

  

Influencer Marketing

Crypto Influencers: Engage crypto influencers to demo Freelii to their audiences. This includes both Stellar ecosystem influencers and those in the broader DeFi space.

Community-Led Referrals: Implement a referral program where users get rewards for inviting friends to join and use Freelii.

Tik Tok Micro influencing showing easy UX of telegram instant to Digital Wallet.

  

Organic Search and Content Marketing

Educational Content: Publish blog posts, explainer videos, and social media content around DeFi, crypto, and Stellar technology. 

  

SEO & Stellar-Related Keywords: Optimize our website and content for keywords related to Stellar, DeFi, and crypto wallets.

  

Events and Conferences: Continue to attend various conferences and build publicity and demo product to crypto users.

  

Launch Phases:

  

Phase 1: Beta Launch:

Launch on Testnet: Begin with a limited launch to select users in the Stellar community and Telegram crypto groups. We’ll gather feedback on usability, performance, and security. Incentivized Beta Testing Outreach: Giving XLM tokens or enrollment bonuses to early testers who provide feedback on the beta version. Also ensuring early users that we will eat any fees based on exclusive invite codes.

  

Based on product feedback we will enhance the AI chatbot to help with onboarding. Using it as a demo bot with step by step guides and reducing friction for future Production rollout.

  

We will use product feedback to create feature comparisons to other popular wallets looking to emphasise key differentiators such as Highlight Viber integration, PassKeys security, customizable transaction flows, ease of use, and advanced features such as customizable transaction flows using Soroban smart contracts.

  

Partnerships and integrations will be key in this stage. Freelii will always be looking to partner with Stellar anchors, DeFi platforms, and even non-Stellar applications to expand its capabilities. For instance, providing seamless fiat on-off ramps and advanced DeFi integration would offer a significant advantage over existing wallets. 

  

Joseph and Jose plan to work in Philippines beginning January. Joseph is well connected with many executives, which can help target the specific country by partnering with local wallets like GCash, or PayMaya, to provide seamless fiat-to-crypto on/off-ramp services. By offering a direct bridge between their wallets and Freelii, users can easily move between fiat (PHP) and crypto. Freelii could be promoted as the crypto extension of these fiat wallets. For instance, GCash and PayMaya already have integrations allowing users to purchase crypto. Freelii can position itself as a partner for Stellar-based remittances and decentralized finance (DeFi) features that these wallets don’t fully offer yet this can easily be done through a local exchange like Coins.PH or larger exchanges globally. Jose is also well connected with a Mexican Forex trader who wants to be one of the first mass adopters of Crypto. This partner has already stated client’s willingness to help bring these projects to mainstream in Mexico. Targeting particular countries will also be our key advantage in releasing our wallet.

  
  

Phase 2: Full Mainnet Launch

Target Date: April 2025

Marketing Push: Coordinated promotion through Viber ads, crypto influencer partnerships, and Stellar community announcements.

  

Referral Program Activation: Launch a referral program to encourage viral growth, allowing users to earn rewards for bringing in new users.

  

Stellar Community Airdrop: Airdrop an amount of XLM or other Stellar-based tokens to users who download Strooper and complete basic tasks (such as setting up their wallet or making their first peer-to-peer transfer). This incentivizes adoption and builds immediate engagement within the Stellar community.

  

Referral-Based Airdrops: Reward users who refer others with airdropped tokens once their referrals onboard and complete specific tasks (like making a transaction). Both the referrer and the referred user receives incentives. This dual-sided approach helps break down psychological barriers to trying a new service and results in organic user acquisition. 

  

Partnerships: Utilise partnerships made in the Beta phase to help support our lunch and collaborate marketing pieces to build traction.

  
  

Phase 3: Post-Launch Growth

Stellar DeFi Integration: Continue building partnerships with Stellar-based DeFi projects and anchors to expand Strooper Wallet’s feature set and user base.

  

Ongoing Product Iteration: Based on user feedback, we’ll release regular updates with new features, such as advanced automation and expanded asset support.

  

Customer Support and Retention:

AI Chatbot: Based on user feedback continue to enhance our AI chatbot to offer 24/7 in-app support for users, improving user retention and satisfaction.

Customer Feedback Loop: Implement an ongoing feedback system, conducting user surveys and engaging with the community to ensure the wallet evolves with their needs.","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KyAneWvA5Fo5OKektQUDfhoVJ2jI-P0oJGulxK3cEGU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

  

User Engagement: Strooper Wallet, Freelii’s prototype, achieved 47 enrollments within just three days of showcasing, demonstrating a strong initial interest and product-market fit.

**Development costs:  
**Our main short-term focus is improving this capability to create a ""one-click"" onboarding experience with Stellar’s PassKeys, which is a complex and resource-intensive process due to the following challenges:

1.  Custom Smart Contracts:  
    We need to design and deploy custom contracts to manage PassKeys, integrate ""C"" and ""G"" addresses, and support our seamless onboarding flow. These contracts will require audits to ensure security, which adds to the cost.
    
1.  Rigorous Testing:  
    Extensive unit testing is needed to ensure every part of the system—from PassKey generation to transaction signing—works reliably and securely, especially when handling financial transactions.
    
1.  Policy Signer Integration:  
    Developing support for custom policy signers is critical to connect ""C"" and ""G"" addresses. This also requires building indexing systems to track and manage accounts efficiently, adding development effort.
    
1.  WebAuth and MiniApp Limitations:  
    Current webviews, like those in Telegram MiniApps, don’t natively support PassKeys. We’ll need to create custom flows to manage PassKeys and signing while ensuring a smooth user experience.
    
1.  PassKey Management:  
    Managing PassKeys within the MiniApp environment requires developing secure and scalable solutions that align with the platform’s limitations. Stellar’s PassKeys enable secure transaction signing, making it easier and safer for users to manage their assets without dealing with private keys.
    

These tasks demand significant development time, expertise, and resources, including the cost of testing, and building new features. This investment is essential to create a seamless onboarding experience that is secure, scalable, and easy to use.

  

Peer-to-Peer Transfers (Done in theory [Freelii Hackathon] - Debugging and improving) ($10K) 

Costs Breakdown:

1.  **Chatbot UX Development and Licensing Fees:  
    **Developing a seamless chatbot experience requires significant investment in UX design to ensure that users can intuitively navigate the remittance flow. Additionally, if leveraging third-party chatbot platforms and LLMs, further increasing costs.
    
1.  API Integration Costs:  
    Integrating with Stellar’s ecosystem requires building robust API connections to support remittance flows. This involves working with SEPs like SEP-10, SEP-12, SEP-6, and SEP-24 for authentication, KYC, deposits, and withdrawals. Each API integration requires development time, testing, and ongoing maintenance to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, integrating with anchors, initially Circle’s USDc and additional partners for fiat on/off-ramping will involve negotiation and potential usage fees, especially for scaling in the Philippines.
    
1.  Backend Development:  
    The backend must be robust and scalable to handle transaction generation, PassKey management, and policy signer integration while ensuring high availability and security. Building this infrastructure will require substantial development time, audits, and server hosting costs, as well as ongoing maintenance and updates.
    

Pivoting to Viber ($2K):  
We originally built Freelii on Telegram, but to better reach our first target market, the Philippines, we are pivoting to Viber for the MVP. Viber’s significantly higher adoption in the Philippines aligns with our target customer base, offering greater potential for user engagement and retention. However, this shift comes with added costs:

-   Viber Integration Costs: Adapting our chatbot and backend infrastructure to work with Viber’s APIs and platform-specific requirements.
    
-   Licensing and Operational Fees: Viber’s platform usage may incur recurring fees, particularly for advanced integrations and enterprise features.
    
-   Localization: Customizing the chatbot UX for cultural and linguistic relevance to the Philippines, including translations, local regulations, and market preferences.
    

Despite these additional costs, the move to Viber will allow us to focus directly on our target customers, providing a more impactful and tailored experience. By prioritizing user engagement in a high-potential market, we aim to maximize early adoption and validate our product more effectively.

Anchor Integrations for On-Off Ramp (Want minimum two anchors before publication to Testnet) ($10K)

Costs Breakdown:

Costs for Anchor Integrations for On/Off Ramp (Target: Minimum Two Anchors, $10K)

1.  Business Accounts + Verifications:  
    Setting up verified business accounts for anchors includes legal fees, registration, and compliance checks like KYC reviews. Estimated cost: $2K-$3K.
    
1.  Setup & Configuration:  
    Anchor-specific setup requires account configuration, secure API key management, and testing. Estimated cost: $1K-$2K.
    
1.  API Integrations:  
    Developing secure API connections for deposits, withdrawals, and compliance with SEPs (e.g., SEP-6, SEP-24) requires thorough testing and optimization. Estimated cost: $2K-$3K.
    
1.  Development:  
    Building backend modules for fiat on/off-ramping and transaction tracking, plus ongoing maintenance. Estimated cost: $3K-$4K.
    
    We have been in discussion with various partners for on/off ramps:
    

Our initial rollout will include the USDC Access (By Circle), and Stripe Connect for On-Ramps. For Off-Ramps, we are focused on integrating with [](http://coins.ph)Coins.PH who will enable digital wallets - GCash and Pay Maya payouts. Our second off-ramp focus will be on Bank deposits VIA InstaPay and PESONet.

Other ramps post MVP:

On-Ramps: Moneygram VIA Stellar, Stripe Connect, Moonpay, ACH Transfers (Via Circle), Enrolled in USDC Access Beta (Circe), Bitso (For eventual expansion to Latam).

Off Ramps (Philippines specific): Moneygram VIA Stellar, Gcash, PayMaya, Coins.PH, Bank deposits VIA Instapay and PESONet, also speaking with Union Bank who is a leading digital supporting bank in the Philippines.","Cost Breakdown: $20K (February - March)

Our TestNet development phase will prioritize features based on user feedback, focusing on delivering key functionalities while addressing technical challenges to ensure scalability and user satisfaction.

1.  **Soroban Smart Contracts ($10K):  
    **Developing Soroban Smart Contracts will enable customizable transaction flows and automation, providing greater flexibility in asset management. However, Smart Contracts on Stellar do not inherently track balances for any asset. Instead, we must specify which assets to monitor and perform inverse searches for each asset, requiring indexing solutions to gather and display data effectively. Implementing this indexing system adds significant complexity and development costs.
    
1.  **Asset Management ($5K):  
    **Providing users with the ability to view and manage their Stellar assets will involve building intuitive interfaces and backend support. Offering decentralized savings accounts through tools like (Script3) Blend introduces additional value, allowing users to earn interest. However, these features require compliance with decentralized finance protocols, as well as development efforts to ensure seamless integration and user experience.
    

Key Technical Considerations and Costs:

-   Indexing Challenges: Building or integrating an indexing system for asset tracking is critical. Without it, Smart Contracts cannot natively display balances, requiring expensive backend development or third-party indexing services to handle this.
    
-   Smart Contracts: Ensuring the security and reliability of Soroban Smart Contracts adds further costs through audits and rigorous testing.
    
-   Custom Integrations: Both DEX and Oracle integrations require tailored development, testing, and maintenance.
    

  

Audit (Free): Will use Stellar Launchkit and apply for credits for Audit. Already in contact with Andreas Mantzoutas, who is already looking to help us start on the technical side and future audit.

Legal Incorporation ($2K): Setting up Delaware LLC, state fees, registered agent services for the first year, virtual address in the US, and operating agreement. Legal adjustments to operating agreement for our specific business such as: Non-Custodial Wallets: Clearly state that Freelii is a technology provider and does not hold or manage user funds, avoiding regulatory misclassification.Crypto Transactions: Include clauses limiting liability and emphasizing compliance to address regulatory grey areas. Cross-Border Transfers: Define how disputes across jurisdictions are handled and ensure compliance with international regulations.","Support and Maintenance ($10K):

Set up user support infrastructure, including ticketing systems. Ongoing maintenance to platform.

Monitoring and Analytics Tools ($1K/Month + $1K Development Fees): Deploy real-time monitoring for transactions and user behavior (e.g., DataDog, Grafana).

Operational Liquidity ($5-10K Reserve Based on Volume):

As non-Custodial, fund flows will need to hold “collateral”. This will allow negative revenue accounts so payouts can be authenticated before the pay-in is captured so we never hold the customer’s cash. Establish liquidity pools to handle transaction mismatches (e.g., refunds, chargebacks).

Infrastructure and Hosting ($1K/Month + $1K Development Fees):

Ensure reliable hosting for mainnet operations, including full nodes, APIs, and failover systems.

Stellar Transaction Fees Reserve ($1-5K Based on Volume):

Maintain reserves to cover operational fees for a defined number of transactions.","Joseph Anthony, Jose Toscano",gkqjdoivvhcsfylol3yy.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/43/43/1752580800000/kpsDwkHMHykLCgyPqXjaaA/9zZ0qNlpa5kY77UxOjkcrymC6AxV8Y2uryfmY5nqTAjJl0PBVQlCc3cIRsgWklHc6U75abpcHum_wpgdqDPKbQ1Jby9kWR6lh15FZ5_1eGlYmzGNiIrkAb9bHVVvkeJv4WP6uHK648UHfD01fz5tzA/5p86uA36oYGv5XjIDbZ_fneCBg1vn7tWaPJxwhp21d4),https://www.linkedin.com/company/freelii/,,,

In many industries, verifying credentials and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements is fraught with challenges:

-   Complex and time-consuming processes that hinder efficiency.
    
-   High susceptibility to fraud and data tampering due to reliance on centralized systems.
    
-   Inherent inefficiencies in traditional methods of issuing and verifying digital attestations.
    

These problems are particularly pronounced in sectors such as financial services, supply chain management, education, healthcare, real estate, and employment verification. Without a scalable and trust-enabling solution, organizations struggle to meet regulatory demands and user expectations for secure, reliable credentialing.

It takes a strategic long-term maintenance approach of automating updates where possible, without compromising on allowing the community to extend the project with manual updates.  
  
It also offers the strong possibility of being able to extend the automatically produced SDK output into native binaries for all the major platforms and CPU architectures, by offering gRPC or protobuf specs. If this aspect of the project is successful, then it means this lightweight Soroban SDK can be available permanently for any platform with manual maintenance software development.  
  
Furthermore, the toolkit will include working boilerplate apps allowing Smart TV , Mobile and other developers to get up and running with Stellar integrated games and apps with no learning curve.

All the deliverables are technical artifacts. Estimated dates of completion are provide in weeks from award confirmation.  
  
#### Deliverable 1: A tool to generate source and automate SDK updates  
Brief Description  
This tool or set of tools includes: a custom OpenRPC -> C# class and client generator generating the entities specified need for comms with the Soroban RPC server; a modification to XDRGEN to emit 'partial' C# classes; a main tool that orchestrates the OpenRPC and XDR Generators to produce outputs, modify them further, and emit the code-generated part of the SDK. In addition, as described in 'How to measure completion,' a test suite will need to be produced (though more tests come later in other deliverables).  
  
How to measure completion  
OpenRPC Soroban RPC specs, XDR specs, and additional metadata generate source that can be included in a simple Console app to communicate with a Soroban RPC instance successfully. This can be determined using the ""examples"" section of the Soroban RPC spec, along with XDR serialisation and deserialisation between the XDR generated classes in the SDK and the strings in the examples.  
  
Estimated date of completion  
T+3 weeks.  
  
Budget  
7000 USD

Brief Description  
This adds the various utility methods and classes into the SDK, such as for signing, allowing Soroban authorisation, helpers to get the account balances and other details described in the technical documentation. The test suite will be extended.  
  
How to measure completion  
Clearly defined tests will pass. The output NuGet package will be added to a simple console app demonstrating some basic scenarios, such as Account funding. (The app is extended to become a full artifact in later deliverables).  
  
Estimated date of completion  
T+5 weeks.  
  
Budget  
2000 USD  
  
#### Deliverable 3: A build variant specifically for Unity  
Brief Description  
IL Weaving will be applied to internalise any dependent assemblies into the main SDK library, while a new build configuration will output a Unity specific DLL. Code generators from Deliverable 1 will be extended to add compile time switches to expose Unity Editor metadata for the Unity build. A simple Unity boilerplate empty game project will be produced that demonstrates some of the intended scenarios such as interacting with a Soroban contract and funding an Account.  
  
How to measure completion  
The DLL will be added to a Unity project and simple scenarios demonstrated. Returned entities, such as a Ledger Entry will have friendly metadata when shown in the editor.

#### Deliverable 4: Boilerplate Applications  
Brief Description  
Boilerplate, skeleton apps for Smart TV, .NET Android , iOS, Windows , Linux (cross platform native), will be produced in full to allow anyone interested in these platforms to simply download the source, compile, run and already be on Stellar. The test app from the Unity deliverable will also be polished. These will all be published as sub projects in the main repo.

#### Deliverable 6: Attempted universal SDK  
Brief Description  
This is an attempt at modifying the client generator to add a second interface that would allow users to either supply an HTTP client or some kind of in memory channel (possibly gRPC), adding a protobuf / gRPC spec file so that clients can generate their own classes in their own language, and the build output to generate precompiled optimised native binaries for all common platforms and CPU architectures. Initial research looks promising. If this works, then the SDK becomes even more generally useful as a universal Soroban SDK that is automatically maintained and offers protobuf to interface with it.  
  
How to measure completion

#### Deliverable 7: Documentation and mainnet finalisation  
Brief Description  
Further documentation will be added to the project repo clarifying the build process, how to maintain, explaining how to test, and enhancing the boilerplate app guidance. A test contract can be deployed to mainnet if necessary and the test console app run against it.  
  
Also - all licensing for all works will be open source.  
  
How to measure completion  
Documentation seems sufficient, readable, and the end to end test app works on a mainnet contract. License on everything is MIT or whatever Stellar Community / Foundation prefers, as long as the SDK outputs or binaries do not mandate that derivative works are open source.

Having launched on Testnet, we now aim to improve our contracts, transition to Mainnet, and leverage Keepers to rescue funds if a strategy becomes unhealthy. Wallet providers will also be able to earn fees from the yield generated on deposited funds.

Our strategies utilize existing DeFi protocols on Soroban, such as auto-compounding with Blend, where USDC is supplied, BLND rewards are swapped for USDC, and reinvested. To enhance these strategies, we will refine our contracts, collaborate with an audit company (funded by the Audit Bank), and prepare for Mainnet deployment.

To secure user funds, we will develop Keepers using Mercury’s infrastructure, integrating Zephyr Programs for metrics and automation tools for execution. These tools will enable wallet providers to automate fund rescues for risky strategies and gather metrics for informed rebalancing.

Additionally, we plan to enhance the user experience for creating vaults, ensuring a seamless and intuitive design that simplifies onboarding and platform interaction.

By addressing the specific needs of freelancers, businesses, and everyday crypto users, Eascrow on Stellar aims to revolutionize escrow services with fast, secure, and low-cost blockchain solutions.","While Eascrow is still in the early stages of development, we have already conducted several validation activities that demonstrate strong interest and potential adoption of our platform within the Stellar ecosystem and beyond.

1) User Surveys

In March 2024, we conducted a survey among 500 freelancers and small businesses across Europe and Latin America. The results indicated that 68% of respondents were dissatisfied with their current payment options for cross-border transactions, citing high fees (average of 7% per transaction) and long processing times (2-5 business days). Additionally, 75% expressed interest in an escrow service that guarantees security and faster payments using blockchain technology.

2) User Interviews and Feedback

We conducted over 30 in-depth interviews with freelancers, small business owners, and crypto users. These interviews highlighted a consistent demand for more transparent and secure transaction methods. Key pain points included fear of non-payment or service delivery failures in freelance agreements, particularly in emerging markets. Over 80% of interviewees mentioned that they would be willing to try a blockchain-based escrow service if it could address these issues. This feedback directly aligns with the core functionality that Eascrow offers, providing both sides of a transaction with increased security and trust.

3) Initial Interest from Ecosystem Projects

We have also reached out to several projects within the Stellar ecosystem, including decentralized marketplaces and digital payment platforms. Two projects expressed interest in potentially integrating Eascrow’s services to enhance transaction security for their users. While these are preliminary discussions, they indicate a strong alignment between Eascrow’s offerings and the needs of other ecosystem players.

These early traction points demonstrate that there is significant market demand for a secure, blockchain-based escrow service, particularly for freelancers and businesses dealing with cross-border transactions. As we move towards the beta launch, we expect to solidify these initial interests and convert them into active platform users. Moreover, as soon as the Eascrow initial development is done, we will build our first Eascrow native product: Linqt, the first web3 freelance marketplace on Stellar.","I) Steps for our MVP : ✅

The mainnet launch will be accompanied by press releases, partner announcements, and Stellar community events to maximize visibility. Post-launch, Hermes will focus on user acquisition through liquidity incentives, referral programs, and educational resources, making the platform accessible to both experienced traders and newcomers. Continuous engagement will be driven by regular updates, trading competitions, and governance activities to maintain user interest and participation.","1. Industry Demand:  

   Perpetual exchanges are one of the fastest-growing sectors in decentralized finance (DeFi), with leading platforms like Jupiter, Hyperliquid, and GMX achieving billions in trading volume. This validates the widespread demand for decentralized derivatives trading. By bringing perpetuals to Stellar, we can tap into an established market while addressing gaps in Stellar's current ecosystem.

  

2. User Interest:  

   The popularity of perpetual exchanges lies in their ability to offer leverage trading, hedge risks, and access diverse assets—all of which attract a broad spectrum of traders. Integrating a perpetual exchange on Stellar provides an opportunity to onboard users from traditional perpetual platforms and expand Stellar's user base into a lucrative market segment.

  

3. On-Chain Metrics from Leading Platforms:  

   - Platforms like Hyperliquid and Jupiter consistently process over $1 billion in daily trading volume.

   - HyperLiquid and the top perpetual exchange have proven that decentralized perpetuals can achieve deep liquidity, attracting both institutional and retail users.

4. Current Gap on Stellar:  

   Stellar currently excels in payments and tokenized assets but lacks advanced trading infrastructures for leverage trading and other advanced derivatives. Adding this feature could fill a key gap, increasing Stellar’s competitiveness and expanding its appeal beyond remittances to DeFi-native users.

  

Justification for Meeting SCF Build Award Criteria

  

- Traction in the Market: The proven success of perpetual exchanges in the broader DeFi market highlights their scalability and user appeal. Introducing this functionality to Stellar could open new doors for user acquisition and ecosystem growth.

- Validation: The success of competitors validates the model, and bringing perpetual exchanges to Stellar offers a unique value proposition: leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions to make perpetuals more accessible and efficient.","-   The current version of Hermes was initially developed during two hackathons, HackMeridian and Dev.to, as a proof of concept for the platform's vision. While it demonstrates the fundamental functionality, it lacks several critical features and remains relatively centralized due to the time constraints of hackathon development. The codebase is publicly available, providing a starting point for further iteration. To transition Hermes into a fully operational MVP, we plan to:
    
    -   Implement support for multiple positions to allow users more flexibility in their trading strategies.
        
    -   Add functionality to support multiple tokens within pools and the ability to create multiple pools, enhancing the platform's scalability and token interoperability.
        
    -   Refactor and fix specific function calls and parameters to ensure smooth execution of all key operations.
        
-   The MVP will be considered complete when the following milestones are achieved:
    
    -   Feature Validation: Successfully supporting multiple positions and multiple token types in pools across several live test cases. Multiple pools functioning concurrently without errors, with seamless interaction for users.
        
    -   Decentralization Progress: Demonstrable steps toward decentralization, such as integrating more Stellar-based smart contracts and reducing reliance on centralized elements.
        
    -   User Feedback: Positive feedback from early testers regarding usability and feature completeness, supported by specific indicators like transaction success rates and pool participation.

This competition will encourage users to interact with key features such as multiple token pools, limit orders, take profit/stop loss (TP/SL), and liquidation functionalities. To facilitate advanced trading features, a dedicated bot powered by Mercury will handle liquidation processes and order execution. The trading competition will run for a set period (e.g., X days), with prizes awarded to top participants. This approach not only fosters user testing but also helps identify areas for improvement based on real-world usage.
    
-   The MVP will be considered complete when the following milestones are achieved:
    
    -   Deployment Validation: Successful deployment of the Hermes platform to the Stellar testnet with all planned features operational.
        
    -   Bot Functionality: Mercury-powered bots executing liquidation, TP/SL, and limit orders without errors during testnet operations.
        
    -   Feedback Collection: Gathering and analyzing user feedback to identify and address bugs or usability issues.
        
    -   Feature Stability: Stable performance of all core functionalities under varied test conditions, ensuring readiness for mainnet launch.

-   $50,000","'-   The mainnet launch of Hermes will represent a significant milestone, transitioning from testnet to a fully operational and audited platform. Prior to deployment, we will conduct a comprehensive audit to identify and resolve any vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in the codebase. Once the audited version is finalized and all identified issues are addressed, the platform will be deployed to the Stellar mainnet. A key addition for the mainnet version will be the implementation of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to manage pool governance, ensuring decentralized decision-making and community-driven growth.
    
-   The MVP will be considered complete when the following milestones are achieved:
    
    -   Audit Completion: A comprehensive third-party audit conducted, with all identified vulnerabilities resolved and the final report available for transparency.
        
    -   Successful Deployment: The Hermes platform deployed to the Stellar mainnet without critical errors or downtime.
        
    -   DAO Implementation: A functional DAO integrated to govern pool operations, with users actively participating in governance decisions.
        
    -   Performance Stability: Stable performance under mainnet conditions, with features like pool creation, token trading, and limit/TP/SL orders functioning seamlessly.
        
    -   User Adoption: Measurable user activity on the mainnet, including metrics like daily active users, transaction volumes, and pool participation rates.
        
    -   Community Feedback: Positive community feedback and engagement through governance and feature use, signaling readiness for scaling and further feature development.
