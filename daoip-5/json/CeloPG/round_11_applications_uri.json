Currently, investments in these regions are predominantly made by professional investors from the US and Europe, leading to a flow of returns back to northern countries and suboptimal long-term benefits for local economies.\n\nd-fund addresses this problem by leveraging blockchain technology to democratize investment opportunities. By breaking down traditional investment products into smaller, more accessible entry tickets, we enable local individuals to invest in their markets, fostering economic inclusion. Yes, this helps investors take part in the development of their markets, but more profoundly, it allows for the funding of impactful projects throughout emerging markets that respond to local problematics.\n\nThese projects are identified by local accelerators and community leaders who have a deep understanding of the specific advantages and benefits of each project. This grassroots approach ensures that the initiatives funded are not only relevant but also effective in addressing the unique challenges faced by these communities.\n\nThrough this innovative approach, d-fund not only empowers individuals in emerging markets to become active participants in their economic futures but also promotes a more equitable global investment landscape, bridging the gap between northern and southern countries while solving local issues and driving sustainable development.",
                            "celo_leverage_how_does_your_project_contributed_to_the_celo_ecosystem": "### How Our Project Contributes to the Celo Ecosystem\n\nOur project will significantly enhance the Celo ecosystem through various strategic contributions:\n\n1. **Features Development**:\n   In the short term, we will develop basic yet essential features by tokenizing real-world assets, making them more liquid and overcoming geographical barriers. In the longer term, we aim to implement decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and incentive tokens to engage individuals in their local economies, thus fostering deeper community involvement and governance within the Celo ecosystem.\n\n2. **Legal Framework**:\n   One of our primary challenges is establishing a robust legal framework. We are conducting an extensive legal analysis to navigate the complexities of token creation, distribution, and international payments. By addressing these regulatory hurdles, we are not only ensuring compliance but also setting a precedent for other projects within the ecosystem. This investment in legal infrastructure will help stabilize and legitimize the broader use of blockchain technology in emerging markets.\n\n3. **Pragmatic Use of Blockchain**:\n   For us, blockchain is a means to achieve our mission, not the end goal. We are focused on delivering a tangible business case that utilizes blockchain as a tool for positive impact, unlike many projects that ride the blockchain wave without substantive value. Our approach highlights the practical benefits of blockchain technology, reinforcing its credibility and usefulness within the Celo ecosystem.\n\n4. **Scalability and Market Focus**:\n   We are targeting emerging markets that are poised for significant growth both industrially and demographically. Initially focusing on the African market for equity investments, we recognize the immense potential across various other markets and investment products. This expansion will drive increased transaction volumes on the Celo platform, boosting its scalability and community engagement. By tapping into these booming markets, we contribute to the creation of a robust economic fabric that aligns with Celo's vision of financial inclusion and sustainable growth.\n\n5. **Alignment with Celo's Core Values**:\n   - **Smartphone Utilization**: Celo's technology is optimized for smartphone use, a perfect match for the African market where mobile phones are integral to daily life. With the widespread use of mobile money services like M-Pesa, our project leverages this mobile-centric culture to enable seamless investment opportunities, facilitating financial inclusion and empowering individuals to participate in their market's growth directly from their mobile devices.\n   - **Carbon Targets**: One of Celo's motivations is to support carbon capture through funding positive social and environmental projects. Our project shares this commitment by focusing on investments in initiatives that address local environmental challenges. By funding impact projects identified by local accelerators and community leaders, we ensure that the investments contribute to carbon reduction and promote sustainable development, resonating with Celo's environmental goals.\n   - **Zero Knowledge Base**: Similar to Celo's vision, we believe that blockchain should be an enabler rather than a barrier. Our approach emphasizes the usability of our platform without requiring users to be blockchain experts. This aligns with Celo\u2019s mission to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone, thereby supporting economic development in emerging markets. By simplifying the investment process and making it intuitive, we lower the entry barriers and encourage broader participation in the digital economy.\n\nThrough these shared values and strategic alignments, our project not only complements the Celo ecosystem but also amplifies its mission of financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, and technological accessibility. Together, we can drive significant social and economic impact in emerging markets, fostering a more inclusive and equitable global economy.\n"

This limits innovation and prevents a diverse range of participants from contributing to and benefiting from advancements in space technology for impact here on Earth. (eg Sat Imagery for agriculture, energy, water)\n\nEstimate Size of the Problem: The global space economy is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2040. However, access to this market is highly concentrated, with only a few major players dominating the industry. The lack of open and decentralized platforms restricts broader participation and innovation, particularly from smaller entities and individual researchers.\n\nSolution Contribution: Deep Venture DAO aims to democratize access to space technology by leveraging blockchain solutions. By tokenizing research outputs and intellectual property, we create an open and transparent ecosystem that allows for widespread participation, collaboration, and innovation. Our decentralized platforms enable researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute to space exploration without the traditional barriers, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic industry.",

By integrating our decentralized tools and platforms with Celo, we will increase the number of active users, transactions, and wallets within the ecosystem.\nTransaction Volume: The tokenization of space research and intellectual property on Celo's blockchain will drive significant transaction volume. Researchers and developers will use Celo's smart contracts and tokens for various purposes, including funding research, sharing data, and rewarding contributors.\nWallet Adoption: As our community grows, more users will create and use Celo wallets to participate in the ecosystem. This will not only boost wallet adoption but also enhance the overall utility and value of the Celo platform."

Traditional business models often prioritize short-term profits over long-term ecological health, leading to severe consequences for our planet and its inhabitants.\n\n**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Complexity**\n\nIntegrating ESG practices into business operations and supply chains is complex, time-consuming, and costly, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Many businesses lack the resources and expertise to effectively measure and improve their environmental and social impact, resulting in missed opportunities for contributing to a sustainable future.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Drivyx Platform**\n\nDrivyx addresses these critical issues by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that democratizes ESG practices, making them accessible and manageable for businesses of all sizes.

Of this, at least 8 million tons end up in the ocean every year, causing severe harm to marine life and ecosystems.\nReFi Tulum's Solution: \nReFi Tulum addresses this crisis through community-driven plastic collection and sequestration initiatives. By partnering with local organizations such as Tulum Circula, Day Zero, Tulum Coin DAO and more, we organize clean-up events and use blockchain technology to track and verify these efforts. And through our close partnership with Petgas we are able to transform plastic into clean ready to use non fossil fuels. Our approach not only reduces plastic waste but also addresses the energy crisis and significantly reduces the enormous supply chain footprint of fuel needed for all vehicles.\nLines of Business:\nPlastic Sequestration: ReFi Tulum implements plastic sequestration programs to capture and repurpose plastic waste, turning it into valuable resources. This not only reduces pollution but also promotes a circular economy.\nCommunity Engagement: By actively involving local communities in environmental initiatives, ReFi Tulum fosters a culture of sustainability and shared responsibility. This engagement to scale our plastic waste management and long-term ecological impact. \nReFi Rides: Our eco friendly transportation fleet offers a new model in shared ownership that leverages eco-friendly transportation with regenerative tourism. It underscores ReFi Tulum's commitment to reducing our plastic footprint, and ensuring the health and biodiversity of our local ecosystems.\nBlockchain Integration: ReFi Tulum utilizes blockchain technology to enhance transparency and traceability in environmental projects. This ensures accountability and encourages broader participation in sustainability efforts.\nEmpowering Communities: Educational programs and active community participation are central to ReFi Tulum's strategy, ensuring that environmental stewardship is a shared effort.\nReFi Tulum\u2019s comprehensive approach addresses the plastic pollution crisis while fostering community engagement and leveraging technology for a sustainable future.\n",

The problem is twofold:\n\n1. ReFi projects struggle to demonstrate and promote their impact outside of the space.\n\n2. The ReFi/Web3 impact space as a whole lacks a central source of information that can help build credibility and attract attention from outside the space. \n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution is a platform that aggregates everything happening in the ReFi/Web3 impact space, from news and events to projects and people. Importantly, the platform must bridge the gap between non-Web3 industries like climate finance and the Web3 world by speaking a language both can understand. It's why the focus needs to be on real-world impact, not technology, jargon, and complexity. \n\nA big part of this is a database of projects operating in the space. By creating a profile page for each project and connecting fundraising, impact, activity, and news data, we give projects a platform on which to build reputation and promote their work.\n\nThe database also allows us to track category- and industry-wide metrics. For example, we envision a \"ReFi Dashboard\" that can provide a snapshot of the impact ReFi projects are having at any given time. \n\nFinally, the database helps us enrich our industry reports: the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN. We aim to provide the kind of data-driven analysis expected of an industry such as ReFi.",

We envision an approach where projects in the DB can \"claim\" their profile by minting an NFT and paying a \"skin in the game\" fee. All revenue would go directly to the community treasury (minus a small percentage to CARBON Copy for prior work done). NFT holders will get governance rights and will be the ultimate decision-makers regarding the future of the DB and how the treasury is utilized. We will also open-source the code-base and transfer ownership to the community.\n\nWe think Celo is the ideal ecosystem for this. It's support for public goods and regenerative impact is a great example for other blockchain ecosystems to emulate. Its philosophy also aligns closely with our own: creating the conditions for prosperity.\n\nSuch an undertaking requires a multi-phased process. We would likely start with an ownership verification process and NFT mint that establishes the foundation of community ownership and treasury. Phase 2 would see integration between the NFTs and the ReFi project database, allowing NFT holders to update their project profile. In Phase 3, we would open-source the code base, transfer ownership to the community, and have the community start making decisions around the database (including paying bounties for updates). Phase 4 would be the complete separation from CARBON Copy.\n\nThis process will probably take a year to complete, so we are looking to raise the funds to complete Phase 1 over the next 3 months. \n\nThe contribution to the Celo ecosystem are centered on increasing wallet growth and transaction activity. The scale will be small to begin with, but as the database becomes an increasingly important to ReFi project reputation, we see the potential for growth in terms of NFT mints and bounty activity. "

Specifically, we tackle the challenge of advocating for the rights of nature by developing AI-powered Environmental Avatars, such as the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar. These avatars serve as digital representations of natural entities like rivers and forests, enabling them to \"speak\" for themselves in legal, cultural, and policy contexts.\n\nThe Rio Sagrado AI-vatar, for example, helps to address the threats posed by environmental destruction in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. By integrating real-time environmental data and cultural knowledge, the AI-vatar acts as an advocate for the Rio Sagrado, raising awareness about the ecological importance of the river and the dangers posed by unplanned urbanization and infrastructure projects. This initiative has already catalyzed a community movement that seeks to recognize the river as a legal entity with inherent rights, a critical step towards protecting it from exploitation and destruction.\n\nMoreover, our project promotes the global adoption of similar AI-driven advocacy tools, empowering other communities to protect their natural environments. By providing an open-source toolkit and collaborating with international partners, we are fostering a broader movement that uses AI to give voice to the voiceless, ultimately contributing to the global effort to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.",

From the outset, Celo emerged as a standout option, not only because of its pioneering role in the ReFi movement but also due to its strong commitment to accessibility and inclusivity. These qualities align perfectly with the needs of the local communities we engage with, beginning with Rio Sagrado.\n\nOur plan is to deploy both the smart contracts for the SymbioToken and the accompanying dApp on the Celo blockchain. This dApp will allow users to interact with the SymbioToken contracts, manage their wallets, and participate in various activities supported by the AI Avatars. By using Celo\u2019s MiniPay app, we aim to make these interactions as seamless and accessible as possible, especially for non-technical users in the communities we serve.\n\nThe integration of Celo's MiniPay into our platform is a strategic first step towards the broader web3 expansion of the AI Avatars. It provides a user-friendly gateway for individuals to engage with blockchain technology, even if they are unfamiliar with the complexities of web3. By choosing Celo, we not only tap into an ecosystem designed for global accessibility but also contribute to the expansion of its use cases within real-world environmental and community-driven projects.\n\nThrough this integration, we hope to contribute to the growing adoption of Celo, bringing novel application scenarios to its community. Our ultimate goal is to increase real-world usage of Celo, reaching beyond tech-savvy users to engage everyday people who can benefit from a more inclusive and sustainable financial ecosystem."

High-interest rates, stringent lending requirements, and limited financial literacy are significant challenges. \n\nOur focus is on scalable solutions that integrate innovation with existing community practices, such as the Washika DAO protocol, to create sustainable economic growth and resilience, while critically assessing the trade-offs and impacts on marginalized communities.

While it is not a \u201creal world problem\u201d in and of itself, it introduces new opportunities for developers involved in projects addressing real-world issues. By using PORTERS to access blockchain data in their projects, users will avoid single points of failure, privacy concerns, and potential manipulation of blockchain data often attributed to centralised RPC providers.",

This means that projects participating in 'Real World Builders on Celo' are eligible to get support from PORTERS for their RPC relays. With this support, we will not only be providing the critical infrastructure needed for a blockchain-based real-world project but also lower the barrier to entry for developers working on impactful projects within the Celo ecosystem, ultimately enhancing its growth.\n\nTogether with our partners at Taiko we are now one of very few providers of a free public endpoint that is not rate-limited. In the future, we would like to explore how this could benefit the Celo ecosystem as well."

Traditional stablecoin on/off ramps, such as MoonPay, impose high barriers to entry, including a $30 minimum transaction and fees as high as 25% for small swaps. This makes digital finance inaccessible to low-income individuals who need it most. Additionally, many people lack the liquidity required to become agents on major platforms like Binance, preventing them from earning income through cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nSargo solves these problems by democratizing access to financial services through its decentralized application (dApp). By enabling micro-swaps starting from just $0.5 with a minimal 2% fee, Sargo breaks down the barriers that have historically excluded underbanked populations from the digital economy. The platform integrates seamlessly with widely used Web2 and Web3 wallets, such as M-Pesa and MetaMask, making P2P cryptocurrency swaps accessible, affordable, and secure. Moreover, Sargo empowers merchants to earn income on every swap they facilitate, creating new economic opportunities starting from just $0.5.\n\nBy providing low-cost, accessible financial services, Sargo is fostering financial inclusion, empowering individuals to participate in the digital economy, and driving economic growth in underserved communities across Africa and beyond.",

By onboarding these underbanked populations, Sargo helps to expand the user base within the Celo ecosystem, bringing more individuals into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nGrowth of Transactions: Sargo\u2019s platform facilitates high volumes of small transactions, with the potential to scale to 1 million swaps annually. This drives significant transaction activity on the Celo blockchain, increasing the overall transaction volume and liquidity within the ecosystem. The more transactions conducted on Celo, the more robust and resilient the network becomes.\n\nGrowth of Wallets: Sargo encourages the use of Celo-compatible wallets through its integration and incentive programs. By making it easy for users to engage in P2P swaps directly from wallets they already trust, Sargo supports the adoption and retention of these wallets within the Celo ecosystem. The platform\u2019s referral incentives further promote the creation and use of these wallets, expanding the wallet ecosystem and enhancing user engagement.\n\nGrowth of Savings and Liquidity: By incentivizing merchants to keep funds in their wallets, Sargo boosts liquidity within the Celo ecosystem. This not only increases the value retained on the Celo blockchain but also contributes to the stability and growth of the network.\n\nIn summary, Sargo\u2019s innovative approach to financial inclusion not only addresses critical needs in underserved communities but also drives significant growth and vitality within the Celo ecosystem, making it a more inclusive and vibrant platform for decentralized finance."

Authors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) **have their copyright expropriated**. Universities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.\n\nScientific publishing houses and science journals have outrageously high publication fees. These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. \nPaying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: \n\u2022\tact as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing, \n\u2022\tuse high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, \n\u2022\ttake a long time from submission to publishing, \n\u2022\tundermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society.\n\nHow do The DeSci Journals solve it?\n\nThe DeSci Journals v2 platform is a digital cooperative.\n\nWe practice 100% copyright for Authors. Industry standard is zero %.\n\nWe use a 1-page with simple and straightforward submission flow for both articles https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-document and journals (recently developed and deployed in version 2) https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-journal which is a new much simpler feature when compared to pages long used in traditional scientific journals. We made adding wallets optional.\nWe have also introduced features such as the percentage of authorship, which can include laboratories, institutions and companies) and the choice of open access or paid access where the funds will go directly to the Author\u2019s (or Authors\u2019) wallet. For version 3 we will develop a web3 login and publish papers as NFTs and push forward a secondary market formation.\n\nBy using The DeSci Journals as platform for their technical and scientific publications which includes events, individuals and communities will capitalize on its technical merit.  They will also tap into a flourishing ecosystem that aligns with a broader vision for the future of science, building a portfolio of tradable scientific assets.",

Traditional markets often fail to account for the true cost of environmental impact and do not incentivize regenerative practices. Local communities, especially in developing regions, struggle to access funding, resources, and technological tools needed to implement sustainable solutions.\n\n**Solution:**\nReFi Mexico's Impact Market Maker (starts with a simple NFT route) addresses these critical issues by leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) to create a transparent, inclusive, and sustainable marketplace for regenerative products and services. Our platform integrates NFT minting with a marketplace designed to incentivize and reward regenerative practices. Here's how we solve real-world problems:\n\n1. **Environmental Sustainability:**\n   - **Carbon Sequestration:** By enabling the tokenization of regenerative practices such as reforestation, sustainable agriculture, and soil regeneration, we create financial incentives for activities that sequester carbon and restore ecosystems.\n   - **Resource Management:** Our platform promotes efficient resource management through the transparent tracking of environmental impact, ensuring that funds are directed towards projects with measurable ecological benefits.\n\n2. **Economic Inclusion:**\n   - **Access to Funding:** We provide alternative funding mechanisms for local communities, farmers, and green entrepreneurs through the integration of DeFi tools. This includes quadratic funding, tokenized assets, and community-driven investment models.\n   - **Marketplace for Regenerative Goods:** Our evolving marketplace connects local producers of regenerative goods with global buyers, opening new revenue streams and fostering economic resilience.\n\n3. **Social Equity:**\n   - **Empowerment of Local Communities:** We empower local stakeholders by providing them with the knowledge, tools, and resources needed to implement and benefit from sustainable practices. This includes educational initiatives, consulting services, and technological support.\n   - **Inclusive Economic Models:** By fostering a network state of impact, we ensure that the benefits of regenerative finance are distributed equitably, supporting marginalized communities and promoting social justice.\n\n4. **Innovation in Tokenomics:**\n   - **State-of-the-Art Framework Design:** We contribute to the field of tokenomics with thoughtful documentation and innovative frameworks that set new standards for regenerative finance. This includes creating templates for impact markets that can be adapted and replicated globally.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe concept of the Impact Market Maker we are creating is a (r)evolutionary solution that addresses the intertwined challenges of environmental sustainability, economic inclusion, and social equity. following bigger frameworks ensuring network coordi-nation. By creating a decentralized, transparent, and incentivized marketplace for regenerative practices, we pave the way for a more sustainable and equitable future. Join us in building a resilient economy that values and rewards regenerative impact.",

Once property rights have been acquired, the owner has exclusive control over the house for their own interests.\n\nIn this stream of work we ask:\n\n> What technologies could be part of facilitating a shift in how we allocate and govern housing, forests, rivers and more as a common resource, rather than property?\n> \n\nThe first phase of exploring technologies to address this was through a research partnership for a housing model with Canopy (Berlin), an innovative set of living spaces suspended above a suite of spaces for play, livelihoods and events. In conceiving of a house being an entity entangled in its environment, a collective emerged to practice the socio-cultural elements of a self-regulating entity with steward participation.\n\nWe now wish to build the route to establishing a flow of modular smart contracts as a test of \u2018Frin\u2019 a suite of smart contracts for moving ownership into the commons.

This will include exploring the incorporation of a Commons Market Maker which would be substantial learning for the Celo ecosystem and also feed back into our wider research work at Dark Matter Labs."

To sustain its vital role within the Celo ecosystem and beyond, nurturing this beloved hub is essential.\n\nOur proposal aims to sustain and enhance the Giveth House as a vital hub for innovation, collaboration, and community-driven development. By leveraging the Celo platform's focus on financial inclusion and sustainability, we can create a robust ecosystem where diverse contributors work together seamlessly. The Giveth House provides free and stable accommodations, empowering contributors to concentrate on impactful projects without the burden of financial stress.\nCelo's blockchain technology facilitates transparent, efficient, and accessible transactions, making it an ideal partner for the Giveth House.

Change Code has the privilege of working with two climate-science-first registries who have each developed several rigorous CO2 nature-based sequestration methodologies. While these innovative projects are non-profits comprised of climate scientists, they do not themselves have the expertise necessary to build or maintain the registry infrastructure necessary to support their own goals around scale and verifiability. This is why they are working with Change Code. By using our primitives to issue web3 native carbon credits, their assets can command a higher market value, contributing to more competition and price discovery in abatement and avoidance assets. Beyond this, we are also co-developing, together with a net zero real estate platform, an open-source primitive for a carbon asset-backed security that will better incentivize the use of timber and other climate-smart construction materials for construction companies and real estate developers. \n\nOther climate impact areas: As of July 2024, Change Code is currently working with 4 projects focused on different areas of environmental impact: abovementioned solar microgrid-facilitated small business and agro development project in Tanzania, in partnership with the Solar Foundation (100% of GG21 funds will go to this specific project summarized above in the \u201cProject Description section\u201d); a small-scale solar development project for electrification of a remote region of Nigeria (Tech and Sun); a water filtration and provision social enterprise in 7 countries across east Africa (Jibu, link in question 8); and a coral reef restoration initiative in Belize (Healthy Reefs, Healthy People). For each of these organizations, Change Code's platform helps them to determine the impact metrics and reporting standards necessary to architect the best possible token representation of their impact. Utilizing our user-friendly Change Credit (impact token) minter, they then immutably record and verify their unique positive impact. These minted tokens represent the tangible impact outputs and outcomes that their organizations have produced, attested to on-chain in a secure and reliable manner.",

We are embracing the OP Stack and are excited to flip the switch to be live on Celo once the L2 is ready!\n\nWe believe that our approach to impact tokenization and monetization can help pioneer a new standard for funding impact where the creation of public goods and positive economic externalities can occur coincident with the economic returns. Purpose and profit don't have to be at odds with each other.\n\nWith the expansion of carbon protocols we're supporting, we expect to issue +100k tons of carbon credits within the next year, and we believe that Celo would be the best home for these assets."

Since AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges. In addition to our agroforestry work, we are opening a skills training center for women and girls, and also young people, that will include Web3 onboarding and computer literacy as well as training for tailoring, catering and salon services. \n\nThe categories of women who need vocational skills interventions are those who are school dropouts,women, widows and those who face extreme poverty, especially related to HIV/AIDS, Conflicts/wars, Politics, among others. Women and girls are in dire need of basic needs and supplementary benefits as Ugandans. These service points can hence be used to create opportunities to the target group who are in communities.The vocational skills and empowerment project is not clearly established to women, school dropouts, widows and orphans due to communities referring them as unfit, and rejects when it comes to inclusion in such projects.\n\n\n**AYOWECCA UGANDA** Community vocational Skills Training Project is one of the programs that will be established to address psychosocial and economic problems among women, school dropouts, widows and orphans in Tororo and nearby areas. Our main focus is to protect natural resources, adaptation to climate change, conservation, skills development and empowering women and children. we are currently under plan of implementing a community skilling center activity in Tororo by February 2024.Through trainings, target groups will be taught different skills in Carpentry, briquette and Paper bag making,plastic recycling, Environment management, Sewing and Tailoring(making reusable sanitary towels, Bricklaying concrete and Practice, Leather Tanning, Hand Craft training ,promoting technologies through Computer training, Plumbing, Mechanics and Party Decoration, Hair dressing among others. After their training, they are expected to be able to produce good quality products leading to increase in Gross Domestic product and profitability. Secondly they will be able to effectively work in their village settings able to create jobs among themselves.\n\nWe will use funding from this grant to support and facilitate these  onboarding, education and advocacy efforts. With your help, we can improve the Web3 ecosystem to be more inclusive and equitable, and to bring the  capabilities and benefits of blockchain technology to vulnerable populations who need it the most.",

Even though more young people are using smartphones, there aren't enough easy-to-access educational resources. This gap leaves many vulnerable to scams and limits their chances to benefit from the growing digital economy.\n\n\nScale of the Problem: \n\n- A large number of Africa's population, particularly in rural regions, suffers from limited digital literacy, which slows cryptocurrency adoption.\n\n- The lack of comprehensive cryptocurrency education has led to significant financial losses due to scams, fraudulent activities, and as well government restrictions.\n\nOur Solution:\n\nAlphablocks is tackling this pressing issue by offering free, accessible, and high-quality cryptocurrency education to communities across Africa. Through our quarterly cohorts, we provide a structured learning experience that empowers individuals to:\n\n- Grasp the fundamentals of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\n- Recognize and mitigate risks associated with digital assets.\n\n- Engage confidently in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n- Become advocates for financial literacy and digital innovation within their communities.\n\nBy equipping individuals with the tools and knowledge they need, Alphablocks is helping to create a more informed and empowered African population, capable of leveraging the potential of cryptocurrencies for economic growth and development.",

Helping Web2 Users in African Countries Escape Inflation.\n\nInflation is a big challenge in many African countries, eroding the value of local fiat currencies and making it difficult for people to save and plan for the future. By saving in crypto stablecoins through Bitsave, users can protect their savings from inflationary pressures. Stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT are pegged to the value of the US dollar, providing a stable store of value that is less susceptible to the volatility and inflation of local currencies.\n\n\n2. Making the Dollar Easily Accessible: The traditional process for opening USD accounts with the banks takes 9 steps including getting 3 DC account holders to reference your forms.\n\nBitsave simplifies the process of accessing US dollar by allowing users to save in dollar-pegged stablecoins (DAI, USDC, USDT). This provides users with a reliable and accessible means to hold and transact in a stable currency, bypassing the complexities of traditional banking and foreign exchange systems.\n\n3. User-Friendly Interface and Automated Recurring Savings Plans\n\nBitsave prioritizes a user-friendly interface to ensure that users, regardless of their technical expertise, can easily navigate the platform. This ease of use is critical in attracting and retaining Web2 users who may be new to the Web3 ecosystem. Key features include:\n\n4. Simple UI/UX: Our intuitive design helps users quickly understand and manage their savings without the need for extensive technical knowledge.\n\n5. Automated Recurring Savings Plans: Bitsave offers automated savings plans, allowing users to set up recurring contributions for essential expenses like rent and school fees. This feature promotes disciplined saving habits and ensures users can consistently set aside funds for critical needs.\n\n6. Stablecoin Savings: Users can create savings plans using stablecoins, ensuring their savings maintain value over time and are not subject to the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies.",

Our initiative tackles the critical issue of aligning financial gain with planetary health, creating a regenerative economy that values human and natural capital.\n\nThrough our innovative approach, we solve several key problems:\n\n1. **Environmental Degradation**: By promoting regenerative practices and solutions, ReFi DAO supports local communities in restoring and preserving their natural environments. Our network of ReFi Local Nodes engages in practical, on-the-ground efforts to implement ecological regeneration, reducing environmental degradation and fostering biodiversity.\n2. **Economic Inequality**: ReFi DAO aims to create a new economic system that benefits all, not just a few. Through the development of tools like the Prosperity Passport and initiatives such as the Self-Organizing Community Playbook, we empower individuals and communities to participate in and benefit from a regenerative economy. This includes creating local currencies, community land trusts, and participatory budgeting systems that ensure wealth and resources are distributed more equitably.\n3. **Community Disconnection**: In an increasingly globalized world, local communities often feel disconnected and disempowered. ReFi Local Nodes bridge this gap by connecting communities through an online network and enabling them to share knowledge, resources, and support. This fosters a sense of unity and collaboration, empowering communities to take collective action towards common goals.\n4. **Scalability of Regenerative Practices**: One of the significant challenges in addressing climate change and economic inequality is scaling effective solutions. ReFi DAO's initiatives, such as the Local Node Incubator and Bioregional Builders, provide the infrastructure and support needed to scale regenerative practices globally. By creating comprehensive toolkits, incubator programs, and mapping regional projects, we facilitate the widespread adoption of regenerative finance and Web3 technologies.\n\nThrough these efforts, ReFi DAO not only addresses the immediate challenges posed by climate change and economic disparity but also lays the foundation for a sustainable, equitable, and regenerative future.",
                            "celo_leverage_how_does_your_project_contributed_to_the_celo_ecosystem": "ReFi DAO has been instrumental in positioning the Celo ecosystem as a central player in regenerative finance, leveraging our unique capabilities to foster a global movement. Over the past three years, our strategic alignment with Celo has showcased the blockchain's potential and driven adoption and application across diverse projects and communities. Our work has helped Celo attract more innovative projects and community engagement, driving further growth and establishing a solid foundation for future developments within the blockchain and ReFi sectors. Some highlights include:\n\n- **Impact Tracking and Hypercerts**: We have launched a pilot for impact tracking using hypercerts minted on Celo. We developed a detailed minting guide and supported 15 nodes in creating their first hypercerts, with plans to initiate a retroactive funding round to reward high-impact projects. This initiative highlights how ReFi DAO utilizes Celo\u2019s blockchain capabilities to enhance transparency and accountability in tracking regenerative impacts.\n- **Celo Integration and Operations**: ReFi DAO has integrated Celo into our operations across all nodes, including the creation of over 23 Celo SAFEs for financial management, hypercerts for impact reporting, and Celo NFT collections. We support the development of further tools on Celo, such as working with Karma GAP to deploy their platform on Celo and onboard our community. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to utilizing and supporting the Celo ecosystem, driving innovation, and fostering community engagement within the regenerative finance space.\n- **Prosperity Passport**: One of our key current projects is the development of the Prosperity Passport, for which ReFi DAO is the lead product designer and partner. This smart account on Celo features a dynamic dashboard highlighting an individual\u2019s contributions within the ecosystem. Built on Superchain Accounts by Kolektivo Labs, the Prosperity Passport aims to showcase participation, impact, and community representation, further establishing Celo as the leading vehicle for real-world impact."

Our GIVbacks & GIVpower programs offer GIV rewards to those who support verified public - challenging the idea that supporting public goods needs to come at a sacrifice.\nOur long-term goal is to support public goods projects to launch their own token economies with augmented bonding curves collateralized by GIV. When market dynamics exist in the public goods sector, token demand and opportunities for speculation will offer sustainable funding streams for competing impact projects. This will ultimately drive innovation in the public goods sector and lead to yet-unimaginable solutions for today\u2019s global problems.\n\n\nOur current numbers, as one can see at stats.giveth.io, are: \nProjects fundraising on Giveth: 3,6k+\nDonors: 17,1k+\nDonations: 68,6k+\nTotal amount: $3mi USD worth of crypto.",

This enables Celo builders to access mentors, public goods funding, and other builders from the wider EVM community.\n\n- **Though we are builders of internet technology, there is no substitute for the bonds forged through real-world connections.** Based on preliminary results from our first public goods builders residency, we believe that we have a strong collaborative peer production model for open-source public goods, through fostering peer collaboration. This is amplified by curating a community of particularly collaborative and mutually supportive builders and by curating a highly conducive environment for collaboration to occur, from the venue selection to the available activities to the dietary selection, all optimized for happy, healthy, harmonious builders.\n\n- **Our residencies and pilots integrate grassroots NGOs and social entrepreneurs addressing real-world problems** in the specific context of the region that they take place in. By exposing builders to these real-world problems and facilitating conversations between builders, activists, social entrepreneurs, and local NGOs, we are exposing builders to potential real-world applications of web3 and giving those same builders direct opportunities to build relationships with organizations solving real-world problems at the last mile\u2014exactly the territory where the Celo blockchain is purpose-built to excel.\n\n- **In Chiang Mai this year, we will run a pilot alongside our builder residency.** The pilot specifically addresses the plight of Burmese refugees fleeing war across the border and integrates various grassroots NGOs that work directly with Burmese refugees, who are often stateless persons (i.e., are not citizens of their native nation-state and therefore do not hold a passport) and thus unable to attain basic access to financial services through conventional channels. Celo builders will have the opportunity to interface directly with these grassroots NGOs, whom we\u2019ve been able to bring in through our partners, who have trusted and longstanding relationships with these local organizations.\n\n- [Video - recap from 2023 Berlin residency](https://youtu.be/NXrqTm9UBZI)\n- [Video - What is a Funding the Commons Residency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ToX5EbFLE8&t=9s)\n\n- **Other key facts about the 2023 Berlin Residency:**\n    - 40 builders participated\n    - 15 sponsors/mentors\n    - We can proudly say that one of the projects incubated during the residency and given its first grant by Funding the Commons post-residency has allowed our community member to receive the ETH Next Billion Fellow Award\n",
                            "celo_leverage_how_does_your_project_contributed_to_the_celo_ecosystem": "- **In our [Berlin public goods builder residency](https://youtu.be/NXrqTm9UBZI), we hosted a number of Celo builders,** including Gainforest, impactMarket, Good Dollar, and others. These builders were able to connect and forge bonds with other builders in the EVM ecosystem, as well as receive support, mentorship, and, in some cases, public goods funding from web3 foundations that supported the builder residency. Celo founder Ren\u00e9 Reinsberg spent time at the Berlin residency, where we facilitated mutually beneficial connections. Celo also offered their Berlin office space to our residents, which forged solid connections between our builders and the Celo ecosystem. Additionally, there were live activations with Celo products, such as sending funds via phone numbers on Valora wallet and learning how to build/deploy on Celo. One of the tangible outcomes of the builder residency was the deployment of the [Hypercerts](https://www.notion.so/GG21-Real-World-Builders-f363b5c9b7ab4acca8d52f80882440cc?pvs=21) protocol on the Celo mainnet. Funding the Commons helped facilitate this deployment through conversations with Celo builders on-site and Berlin-based builders from the Hypercerts team. The residency also introduced one of our builders to the Celo ecosystem (Sophia Dew), which later led to her stepping into a role as Celo developer relations engineering lead. It was the first time I heard about Celo, and then it was so clear that all the goals that FTC has with democratizing access to capital were the goals of Celo and actively being worked on by the Celo ecosystem projects.\n\n- **Funding the Commons CEO David Casey is a Celo Scout** and has funneled over 10 founders and projects into the Celo ecosystem to date, often giving these builders personal time and attention to secure ecosystem funding.\n\n- **We are currently coordinating with Celo developer relations engineering lead [Sophia Dew](https://www.fundingthecommons.io/residencies)** to have a similarly strong presence of Celo builders at our upcoming Chiang Mai residency this November. We have already confirmed two prominent builders in the Celo ecosystem and have more confirmations on the way.\n\n- **We are producing professional-quality short videos highlighting public goods builders** and distributing those videos through our partner networks. Receiving funding from the Real World Builders campaign will enable us to highlight real-world builders in the Celo ecosystem, such as David Dao and Marco Barbosa.\n\n- **Celo builders will have the opportunity to present their projects on stage during a builder demo day at Funding the Commons Bangkok,** where we anticipate 700+ attendees from the broader Ethereum community, as well as the international humanitarian sector, and the SEA public sector. [See Funding the Commons Berlin residency update for our builders at the FtC Berlin Conference in 2023.](https://youtu.be/BJTGP_JqZl8?si=FpbDtZRKiGTMDshH)\n\n- **We are also working with Talent Protocol to create a custom sponsorship package** that allows builders in need of a travel stipend to attend the residency, thereby diversifying the talent pool and being able to extend invitations to groups like UNICEF Office of Innovation and some of the projects they are incubating in SEA.\n\n- **We continuously platform and collaborate with Celo for event programming.** For example, at the Berlin 2023 conference, we were graciously given the Celo office for our Workshop Stage and hosted a popular Fireside Chat between David and Rene Reinsberg.\n"

How do we decentralize more than just money and assets? A primitive has been missing - attestations.\n\nAttestations are digital signatures on structured data, enabling entities like smart contracts, individuals, or businesses to verifiably state facts about anything, i.e. \"I attest this information is valid\". They are foundational for building trust in both online and onchain experiences.\n\nThey significantly speed up the development time for builders who need to verify and rely on signed data (attestations). For example, imagine if you wanted to create a land registry. You'd need to write a custom contract that would allow the government to sign and register a parcel of land. It would be fully custom. With EAS you'd simply register a schema for \"Land Registry\" and then any entity can make attestations on it. And others could then compose ontop of the attestation for asset transfers and much more.",
