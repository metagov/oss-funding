                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "SendIN is a payments platform built on the Stellar network, designed to revolutionize the process of sending money from the US to India. We make US-to-India money transfers easy, affordable, transparent and lightning-fast without any crypto complexity. Funds can be sent to a recipient‚Äôs email, and INR is delivered directly to their Indian bank account within minutes. While the backend leverages Stellar‚Äôs low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure, the frontend remains entirely Web2-native. No wallets, seed phrases, or tokens required. SendIN brings the benefits of blockchain to users who never need to know it‚Äôs there. The tech‚Äôs complex. The experience isn‚Äôt.\n\nPreviously, we were awarded an activation award to build the phase 1 of our MVP on Stellar. We developed a fully functional application that enables a user in the US to send money to an email address, with the receiver in India getting INR directly in their bank account ‚Äî all abstracting away blockchain complexity. Key technical accomplishments include:\n\n1.  A complete full-stack app with secure login, auth stack & database with email ‚Üî wallet mapping.\n    \n1.  Stellar SDK integration for transactions on the network & creating sponsored addresses.\n    \n1.  End-to-end money transfer orchestration on Stellar testnet.¬†\n    \n1.  Partnerships & integrations with on/off-ramp providers (Kado.money, Onramp.money) to bridge USD ‚Üî USDC ‚Üî INR\n    \n1.  Custodial key management using AWS KMS and delegated signing of transactions\n    \n1.  Initial implementation of SEP-6 for anchor operations & SEP-12 for KYC storing and passing.\n    \n1.  Currently accepting users on our waitlist at sendin.app\n    \n\nIn Phase 2, we‚Äôre evolving SendIN from a functional MVP to a production-grade, corridor-scalable payments platform. A key challenge we faced in Phase 1 was the absence of a reliable Stellar anchor in India. After extensive exploration, we partnered with Onramp.money and collaborated with their team to build infrastructure for non-custodial USDC off-ramping‚Äîbut the service remains SEP non-compliant and lacks full protocol alignment. On the on-ramp side, we had fully integrated with Kado.money, but following its recent acquisition and shift in services, we are now migrating to alternate providers. Phase 2 will address these limitations while expanding our infrastructure, formalizing compliance, and preparing for growth. Features / improvements in this phase include:\n\n1.  Build and deploy India‚Äôs first production-grade Stellar anchor to support off-ramping USDC & XLM ‚Üí INR, including SEP-6, SEP-12, and SEP-31 compatibility.\n    \n1.  Add dynamic support for multiple on-ramp providers (Banxa, Transak) with backend routing based on user location, availability, and cost.\n    \n1.  Begin development of a Soroban smart contract layer to enable programmable disbursement logic, revenue-sharing models, and wallet restrictions. All complexity remains fully abstracted from users.\n    \n1.  Implement passkey-based authentication and migrated to a non-custodial approach by using dfns to use MPC infra for wallets and enhancing security while maintaining seamless UX.\n    \n1.  Continue onboarding users through the sendin.app waitlist and begin controlled mainnet rollout for transaction flows.",

This initial traction will validate product-market fit and prove that web2-native users can adopt a blockchain-powered backend without friction. We expect a growing share of users to be freelancers, remote workers, and NRIs with family ties in India; audiences underserved by traditional remittance channels.\n\nHowever, the deeper success lies in expanding access. By removing the need for crypto wallets, seed phrases, or exchange accounts, we‚Äôre onboarding entirely new cohorts into on-chain finance. The user experience is fully abstracted; money moves on Stellar, but users stay in their comfort zone.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, success includes the launch of India‚Äôs first SEP-compliant Stellar anchor which is currently a critical missing link in the ecosystem. We are positive that we could also market out the anchor at some point, which then could potentially be adapted by a lot of on-chain products in India",
                        "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "SendIN will launch in four strategic phases, focused on the US ‚Üí India remittance corridor, followed by groundwork for UAE expansion.

Key goals: complete real transfers using Stellar infrastructure,¬† validate compliance (KYC, transaction flow), and gather UX feedback.\n\nPhase 2 ‚Äì Closed Beta (Late Q3 2025):  \nOnboard select freelancers, expats, and early adopters from partner networks. Optimize flows and transaction reliability with real-world usage. Referral-based onboarding begins. KYC and INR disbursement experience refined with small-value transfers.\n\nPhase 3 ‚Äì Full Launch US ‚Üí India (Q4 2025):  \nLaunch to the public with full Web2-native UX and Stellar mainnet infrastructure. Users can send USD to emails; INR lands in recipient bank accounts within minutes. Roll out in-app referrals, transparent pricing, and FX efficiency as core value props.\n\nPhase 4 ‚Äì UAE ‚Üí India Groundwork (Q1 2026):  \nBegin integrating multi-currency backend logic and initiate partnerships with UAE-based payment providers. Build compliance readiness for corridor expansion.  \n  \nAcquisition Channels:\n\n-   Partner with freelancer platforms (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr)\n    \n-   In-app referral incentives for NRI users and diaspora communities\n    \n-   Tie-ups with alumni networks, Indian expat orgs\n    \n-   BD with remote payroll tools (e.g. Deel)\n    \n-   Content marketing on cost-saving, remittance pain points",
                        "stellar.tractionEvidence": "SendIN was awarded an SCF Activation Award during SCF #27, which allowed us to build and rigorously test an almost full-featured prototype on Stellar testnet. Since then, our project has steadily validated both technical and market feasibility. To date, over 550 users have joined our waitlist, primarily Indian-origin freelancers, remote workers, and expats. This growth has been entirely organic: driven through Discord, fintech Twitter, diaspora communities, and word of mouth, without any paid marketing. For privacy and compliance reasons, we are unable to share individual user data publicly, but we maintain all relevant KYC and waitlist submissions securely on our backend.\n\nTo further validate user needs, we conducted 30+ structured interviews with potential angel users and stakeholders in the remittance space, which shaped our onboarding and product design. These conversations revealed deep dissatisfaction with existing payment rails and strong excitement for a faster / cheaper experience. We found out people don‚Äôt really care about the tech behind given that it‚Äôs powerful & safe.\n\nOn the institutional side, we've also been approached by multiple early-stage VCs and fintech scouts, intrigued by our positioning at the intersection of Web2 usability and blockchain-native infra. These conversations are ongoing but signal real interest from the capital side once we‚Äôre closer to mainnet traction.\n\nSendIN was also invited to pitch at Stellar Meridian 2024 in London, where the project received enthusiastic feedback from members of the Stellar Development Foundation, ecosystem founders, and protocol engineers. Together, these signals, a growing waitlist, structured validation, ecosystem visibility, and investor interest, reflect early traction for a product that solves a real, painful problem in a $15B+ corridor.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Traditional indemnity insurance is pulling back in the face of rising climate risks. In 2024, climate-related disasters caused 94 billion dollars in U.S. losses, according to NOAA. Major insurers like State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers have exited or paused new business in states like California. Chubb, Travelers, and USAA each reported over 1 billion dollars in wildfire-related losses. As a result, parametric insurance is gaining traction as a faster and more transparent alternative. The California State Assembly recognized its potential in a recent insurance reform report.\n\nSentinel Protocol is a modular parametric insurance framework built on the Soroban blockchain. It connects users seeking protection with DeFi investors who underwrite risk in exchange for yield. Smart contracts and decentralized oracles automate claims and payouts, removing intermediaries and ensuring transparency at every step.\n\nThe protocol can support any real-world risk where reliable oracle data is available. Our first product is Flight Delay Insurance, which pays users automatically if their flight is delayed beyond a set threshold. The product launches first on Testnet, followed by a Closed Beta on Mainnet, with a streamlined user interface for travelers and a dashboard for capital providers.\n\nWe began with the Kickstart Grant, which helped us validate Sentinel‚Äôs technical foundation. While we have made meaningful progress, there is still much to build. You can find a detailed update on our technical progress and roadmap in the Technical section.\n\nBuilt natively on Soroban, Sentinel Protocol uses:\n\n-   Soroban Smart Contracts to automate all core operations including deposits, claims, and payouts.\n    \n-   Acurast Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to deliver real-time, tamper-resistant data to the blockchain.\n    \n-   Stellar SDKs used to connect liquidation bots and keepers that advance the protocol's state and coordinate interactions seamlessly.\n    \n\nWe are open-sourcing the Sentinel Protocol framework to support the Soroban developer community, offering reusable components like modular vaults, oracle pipelines for Web2 data, and automation tools such as liquidation bots and keepers. Alongside this, we‚Äôre releasing documentation, tutorials, and videos to help others build or extend Sentinel for new DeFi use cases. The framework is flexible and designed for easy deployment of parametric insurance products across diverse risk markets, with the goal of disrupting traditional insurance and enabling others to build on top of it.\n\nOur market contract includes a configurable commission fee that allows the deployer to earn revenue as a creator or intermediary. Whether we plan to monetize the open-source framework by charging other teams is still open for discussion and experimentation.\n\nIn short, Sentinel Protocol provides the following:\n\n-   For the developer community:\n    \n    -   A reusable ERC-4626 style vault standard for any DeFi project on Soroban\n        \n    -   Oracle integration using Acurast TEE to securely fetch Web2 API data\n        \n        -   Among the first implementations bringing Acurast to Soroban\n            \n        -   Expands oracle capabilities beyond on-chain asset prices (e.g., flight data, fire zones)\n            \n    -   Example liquidation bots and keepers to automate contract state progression\n        \n    -   Full developer support with documentation, tutorials, and example integrations\n        \n-   For DeFi yield seekers:\n    \n    -   Earn yield by underwriting real-world risks\n        \n    -   Transparent vaults with automated payouts\n        \n    -   Uncorrelated returns tied to actual insurance demand\n        \n-   For insurance buyers:\n    \n    -   Easy-to-use UI to purchase protection\n        \n    -   Instant, automated payouts triggered by real data\n        \n    -   No middlemen, claims, or delays",

Our first product targets the flight delay insurance market, valued at 1.37 billion USD in 2024, growing at 14.5 % CAGR, per Business Research Insights. We aim to capture early market share by getting real users into live parametric markets‚Äîstarting with Flight Delay Insurance.\n\nSince receiving the Kickstart Grant, our two-person developer team has been focused on shipping. We‚Äôve made significant technical progress on Sentinel Protocol, a modular on-chain insurance framework built on Soroban. Highlights include:\n\n-   Built a modular ERC-4626 equivalent vault standard, ready for internal use. View the repo.\n    \n    -   ERC‚Äë4626 style vault contracts are rapidly gaining adoption, with usage up 32.23% since October 2024 according to Glider data by Hexensio (source). This shows that developers are increasingly looking for shared, plug-and-play standards for interest-bearing assets. It's a strong signal that Soroban has an opportunity to capture this momentum by supporting DeFi protocols that rely on vault primitives.\n        \n-   Collaborating with OpenZeppelin to contribute the vault to their Soroban token library. Opened Issue, PR to follow\n    \n-   Integrated Acurast TEE with Soroban for secure Web2 data feeds. Integration code\n    \n\nWe‚Äôve also validated real use cases and built functional prototypes:\n\n-   We have built Hedge/Risk Market based on vault primitive. Contract Code\n    \n-   General Hedge and Risk Market UI built and ready for testing, designed to support multiple parametric insurance markets including Flight Delay Insurance. View UI and the UI Code\n    \n-   Fire Insurance prototype using NASA FIRMS satellite data on top of our framework to demonstrate that given oracle data, we can build Parametric Insurance (Hedge Market) on any vertical. Project link\n    \n-   We‚Äôve engaged with teams exploring new verticals on top of the Sentinel framework, including a project focused on crop insurance for drought risk in West Africa - they are in the process of applying to Kickstarter Round 11.\n    \n-   We conducted 12 user interviews at ETHDenver 2025, and during the Kickstart Week including DeFi yield seekers and insurance buyers.\n    \n\nEarly simulations show strong yield potential across multiple insurance verticals, indicating a sustainable model for risk investors:\n\n-   Flight delay insurance, modeled using over 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with delay probabilities from 1% to 20%, shows a median yield of 96.11% at a 3-hour delay threshold. Flight delay yield analysis\n    \n-   1,000 properties with $3,000 annual premiums and $150,000 payouts were simulated with fire probabilities between 0.3% and 1.7%. Across thousands of runs, the average annual yield ranged from 40% to 50%, showing consistent profitability despite risk variability.. Fire Insurance Yield analysis\n    \n\nWith the Build Award, we will complete the remaining infrastructure and then shift our focus to onboarding insurance buyers and capital providers‚Äîtesting live markets, validating sustainable yields, and accelerating real-world adoption.",

User Acquisition and Community Engagement\n\nOur initial user acquisition strategy focuses on targeted outreach to early adopters within the Stellar and broader Web3 communities, using educational content, demos, and incentives to drive sign-ups and usage.\n\nWe will launch a phased beta, inviting feedback from select users to refine the product and build advocacy among key stakeholders.\n\nCommunity-driven growth will be encouraged through referral programs, and active participation in Stellar forums, Discord, and social media channels.\n\n3. Iterative Product Development and Scaling\n\nWe will employ a data-driven approach, using analytics and user feedback to prioritize feature enhancements and address pain points rapidly.\n\nPost-launch, we will expand our marketing efforts to include partnerships with fintech influencers, content marketing, and participation in industry events to increase visibility and credibility.\n\nAs traction builds, we will explore additional distribution channels, including integration with third-party platforms and business development with enterprise clients.\n\nMilestones and Metrics\n\nBeta Launch: Within 1-2 months post-funding, targeting a core group of users for feedback and validation.\n\nPublic Launch: After incorporating beta feedback, a broader rollout with PR, social campaigns, and ecosystem events.\n\nGrowth Tracking: Key metrics will include user adoption rates, transaction volumes, partner integrations, and community engagement levels.\n\nSustainable Growth\n\nWe will continuously engage with the Stellar Community Fund network for mentorship, funding opportunities (such as the Build and Growth Awards), and ecosystem support to sustain momentum and drive long-term impact.\n\nThis multi-phased, ecosystem-centric go-to-market plan ensures that our project not only launches successfully but also achieves meaningful adoption and contributes to the broader Stellar mission.",

There, we discovered that high transaction fees frustrated many users, prompting us to prioritize affordability. This experience, aligned with Stellar‚Äôs mission of accessible finance, gave birth to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\n\nSince launching in March 2023, we‚Äôve achieved the following metrics while bootstrapping, with our P2P feature and payment system going live in Q4 2024 after wining Stellar Kickstart grant of $15,000. Beside User Growth, all data provided is from Q4 2024 to April 2025, reflecting rapid early growth:\n\nUser Growth: Acquired 14,210 users organically (zero CAC) through social media, referrals, events, and word of mouth from March 2023 to April 2025, leading to 1,795 Active Users. This represents a 12.6% conversion rate from acquired users to active users.\n\nTransactions: Processed $75,000 across 1,967 transactions, averaging $38 per transaction.\n\nRevenue: Generated $1,360 from a 1.1%‚Äì1.6% transaction fee depending on the transaction type and 50% of revenue from an ad-driven reward system, where users earn incentives for engaging with ads to offset transaction fees. This early revenue validates our model‚Äôs potential.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (LTV): We are actively calculating LTV as we refine our monetization strategy with early estimates at $10 per active user based on transaction frequency.\n\nDespite limited resources, we‚Äôve maintained lean operations by leveraging free marketing channels and are exploring partnerships with local fintechs, telcos and small business owners to scale user acquisition. Moving forward, we plan to boost our activation rate to 20% through enhanced onboarding with in-app tutorials and scale revenue to $5,000 monthly by Q3 2025 by introducing new revenue streams.\n\nMeanwhile, we are excited to share a mainnet demo we released for our integration so far.",

It offers a step-by-step journey where learners:\n\n-   Follow short, engaging tutorials directly embedded in a map-based interface\n    \n-   Create and connect Stellar wallets (e.g., Freighter, Albedo)\n    \n-   Complete real on-chain actions such as sending a transaction, claiming tokens, or interacting with Stellar dApps\n    \n-   Verify their actions and receive Proof-of-Learning NFTs minted on Stellar\n    \n-   This Academy is built and managed by the VenaLabs team, and serves as the flagship experience to onboard users into Stellar.  \n    \n\n#### StellarMap Editor ‚Äì Course Builder SaaS (VenaLabs Product #2 ‚Äì External)  \n\nThe StellarMap Editor is a SaaS product that empowers any Stellar-based project to build its own gamified onboarding experience.\n\nWith this tool, projects can:\n\n-   Design custom onboarding maps using a drag-and-drop editor\n    \n-   Guide users through quests and explain their dApp functionalities clearly\n    \n-   Require real on-chain interactions (e.g. swap, stake, mint) or off-chain actions\n    \n-   Automatically verify completions and issue Proof-of-Learning NFTs\n    \n-   Embed their academy directly into their own website via SDK or iframe\n    \n\nMost Stellar projects struggle to explain what they build. Beginners often don‚Äôt know how to interact with the ecosystem. The StellarMap Editor solves this by giving teams a ready-to-use tool to educate, onboard, and retain users through engaging, trackable journeys.",

                        "stellar.successCriteria": "Our success will be measured through a combination of quantitative metrics (user onboarding, quest completions, NFTs minted) and qualitative impact (user understanding of Stellar, increased network participation, project adoption).\n\n#### 1. User Acquisition and Onboarding Impact\n\nTarget Output:\n\n-   5,000+ new users onboarded within the first 3 months of mainnet launch\n    \n-   3,000+ NFTs minted as proof-of-learning\n    \n\nExpected Impact:\n\n-   Simplifies access to Stellar for non-technical users by making the onboarding process visual, gamified, and educational\n    \n-   Empowers users to become familiar with Stellar wallets, assets, and network mechanics in a real, hands-on way\n    \n-   Converts passive interest into actual on-chain participation\n    \n\n#### 2. Community Engagement and Referrals\n\nTarget Output:\n\n-   50% of new users joining via referrals from the leaderboard system\n    \n-   XP and achievement system integrated into at least 2 partner communities\n    \n\nExpected Impact:\n\n-   Builds a grassroots, community-led growth engine\n    \n-   Creates a self-sustaining loop of user acquisition and retention\n    \n\n#### 3. Financial and Educational Inclusion\n\nExpected Impact:\n\n-   StellarMap Academy lowers the entry barrier for newcomers to Web3, especially in underbanked or non-technical regions\n    \n-   Helps shift learning from passive consumption (blog posts, docs) to active, verified learning on-chain\n    \n-   Bridges the gap between Stellar technology and real user adoption by delivering education through experience\n    \n\n#### 5. Long-Term Sustainability\n\n-   Quest logic, contract templates, and leaderboard system will be reusable for future Stellar ecosystem partners\n    \n-   The XP/reputation system will evolve into a decentralized learning proof layer, usable by projects for user segmentation, gating, or access rights\n    \n-   Continued roadmap includes integrations with DeFi protocols, NFTs, and asset discovery tools on Stellar",
                        "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "Following the SCF submission and completion of the StellarMap Academy MVP, our go-to-market strategy is designed to maximize adoption, visibility, and community participation. Our approach combines product-driven growth, strategic partnerships, media outreach, and gamified viral mechanics to ensure strong traction from day one.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Timing & Launch Coordination\n\nWe are preparing a coordinated launch campaign starting June 2025, aligned with the completion of our MVP and the fundraising activities of VenaLabs. This timeline allows us to:\n\n-   Launch with a polished and tested product\n    \n-   Coordinate outreach across multiple influencers and communities\n    \n-   Maximize visibility before summer events and blockchain ecosystem activities\n    \n\nThe launch will follow a multi-phase rollout:\n\n-   Soft launch with early community testers\n    \n-   Beta access for ambassadors and early adopters\n    \n-   Public mainnet release with press, social media and partnership content\n    \n\n#### 2. Influencer & Media Strategy\n\nTo drive awareness and trust, we are currently raising equity funds from top-tier Web3 influencers and educators in the French-speaking and international ecosystem, including:\n\n-   Hasheur (YouTuber, investor, founder of Meria)\n    \n-   Cryptopicsou (educator and technical explainer on blockchain)\n    \n-   Cryptoast (leading crypto media in France)\n    \n\nThese figures will act not only as investors, but also as distribution multipliers. Through their YouTube channels, newsletters, and X (Twitter) accounts, they will create tailored content that highlights:\n\n-   The benefits of learning through StellarMap Academy\n    \n-   The ability to earn XP and NFTs through an accessible quest system\n    \n-   The larger vision of VenaLabs as a gamified on-chain learning infrastructure\n    \n\nWe plan to support these campaigns with a well-produced explainer video, shared across channels.\n\n#### 3. Client Partnerships and Ecosystem Leverage\n\nWe already have signed partnerships with XRPL and iExec, for whom we are developing similar onboarding and mapping solutions. These relationships validate our model and allow us to:\n\n-   Cross-promote to their user bases\n    \n-   Reuse or adapt quest models that are proven to drive adoption\n    \n-   Build brand credibility within the broader Web3 developer ecosystem\n    \n\nWe will use the credibility of these early clients to attract new Stellar-based projects and dApps who may later create and integrate they map with our API (planned post-grant).\n\n#### 4. Community-Driven Growth: Leaderboard, Referrals & XP System\n\nThe core of our growth engine will be gamification and community activation. Users completing onboarding will be encouraged to:\n\n-   Refer new users using personalized invite links\n    \n-   Climb a public leaderboard showing XP, referrals and completed quests\n    \n-   Earn special badges and NFTs for top performance\n    \n\nThis model rewards community participation and allows us to:\n\n-   Grow organically through peer-to-peer sharing\n    \n-   Foster user retention via competition and progression\n    \n-   Build early momentum for integration into partner dApps\n    \n\nUsers will be able to gain XP not only through learning, but by contributing to the community, validating quests, suggesting improvements, and reporting bugs further reinforcing engagement.\n\n#### 5. Growth Channels and Campaigns\n\nOur campaigns will be launched across the following channels:\n\n-   YouTube: Education-focused videos produced in collaboration with Hasheur and Cryptopicsou\n    \n-   Twitter/X: Daily threads, campaign announcements, user testimonials\n    \n-   Discord/Telegram: Community-driven feedback loop and challenge system\n    \n-   Launch Platforms: Inclusion in Stellar and SCF official channels, StellarX, and community tools\n    \n\nWe will publish content in English and French, to reach both global and francophone audiences.\n\n#### 6. Success Metrics\n\nWe will evaluate the success of our go-to-market strategy based on:\n\n-   User growth: 10,000+ verified users onboarded within 3 months of launch\n    \n-   Referral activity: 50% of new users coming through invite links\n    \n-   NFTs minted: 3,000+ proof-of-learning NFTs issued\n    \n-   Influencer engagement: Reach of >1 million impressions across YouTube + X from partners\n    \n\n#### 7. Long-Term Ecosystem Value\n\nBeyond launch, StellarMap Academy will continue to grow as an entry point to the Stellar ecosystem. As new projects emerge, we aim to become:\n\n-   A go-to platform for user onboarding\n    \n-   A learning layer for ecosystem education\n    \n-   A gateway to build reputation, XP, and trust via on-chain verification\n    \n\nBy combining interactive UX, gamification, and smart contract-based validation, we create a sustainable tool for education and engagement within Stellar.",

Our tooling brings together different data providers and enable builders to simplify their tech stack and the operational complexity they need to manage as they build and operate their projects.\n\nWe provide a single place to go to access all the data needed. This can be APIs to check transaction history, token price, market data, and more. We are also able to stitch together the various data providers to create a wholistic experience -- for example, when SimpleHash was acquired recently and went offline, our users were able to continue without disruption as we brought endpoints from 6 different providers into one place to provide 98% coverage for the gap that SimpleHash left. Without Uniblock, developers need to struggle to talk to each of the different providers, read all of their documentation, and then contract and pay monthly invoices from all the different providers they work with.\n\nOur business is in understanding the data provider landscape, negotiating the best enterprise agreements, and bringing it all together into a simple and easy to use experience for developers. And on top of that, we add an AI routing layer that intelligently routes data requests to the provider that is offering the best price and best latency. We also automatically detect failures and outages and move project data requests to the next-best provider; minimizing outages and downtime that affect the end-users of applications, while also taking away the need for projects to build this redundancy (and the need to pay for backups that may never be used) away from projects.  \n  \nYou can read a quick 1 pager about us here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vh5Qr7Gu7iVMGi54T8f9Jw97ENP2S8os/view?usp=drive_link\n\nAdditional Information added: \n1. With indexers such as Goldsky, we will run 1 indexer account in Uniblock backend. We will then allow users to have one billing system under Uniblock without having to pay for a separate indexer account. We will wrap around the indexer CLI and create a new Uniblock-indexer CLI to provide all functionalities. In addition, we will create a copy of indexer query studio for graphql queries\n\n2. While most Stellar Horizon providers truncated its historical data to one year, as long as there exists providers that provide complete historical data, we can aggregate it. For example, we can work with Bitquery https://explorer.bitquery.io/stellar/operations and other similar api providers as backup\n\n3. The value of Uniblock, and the issue in the industry that we are solving for developers, is that we eliminate the need to have costly secondary and tertiary agreements with other providers that are only used in the event of an outage of the primary provider.¬†\n\nUniblock's infrastructure is run on GCP (Google) and has benefits from this stable, as near as possible to 100%, uptime. Our customers do not need additional providers as Uniblock is more stable than even having 2, 3, or even more backup RPC providers.",

In total, we will introduce 4 (plus the one already created), having different contracts for each type allows developers to just pick the one they need instead of loading one big heavier contract. These contracts are:\n\n-   Atomic call (the one already created): A contract that executes multiple calls in the same contract call and throws an error if one of them fails, this simulates the way in the classic side an app can execute multiple operations with the safety of rejecting the whole transaction if one of them fails.\n    \n-   Optional succeed call: A contract that lets you send multiple contract calls without where you can decide if it's ok for some of them to fail, an example where this might be useful is when an arbitrager wants to send multiple calls where the goal is to get as many as possible accepting if one or more of them fail.\n    \n-   Conditional calls: A contract that lets developers execute transactions where based on the result from one of the calls it decides what to do next, this allows simulating a classic \"if this then that\" logic.\n    \n-   Chain flow call: A contract that lets you take the result of one call and inject that result into the following contract call.\n    \n-   Mega call: A contract that has all of the other contract features included and lets the developer use them in the configuration needed, this will be in fact the heavier contract but there are situations where it helps. For example, a developer wants to withdraw from a pool and after that, it wants to get the balances from two assets to later use the result from both calls to fund another different pool, all of that will be possible without that developer needing to upload its own contract.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Blux is a frontend package that helps developers integrate Stellar support into their applications. It takes care of logins, transaction signing, sending and receiving assets, on and off ramping, user analytics, and provides a set of custom hooks and helper functions that make it faster and easier to build on Stellar. By abstracting away low-level wallet integrations and offering a simple but flexible setup, Blux reduces development time and lowers the barrier for developers looking to build applications on Stellar, which in turn helps expand the network with more usable, polished tools.\n\nBlux starts with a login modal that acts as the main entry point for users. This is where users choose how they want to log in, and it supports all the major Stellar wallets like Freighter, Albedo, xBull, and more. Developers can customize this modal fully‚Äîchanging the layout, logo, color theme, or even the order of wallets shown. Blux also supports cold wallets like Ledger and Trezor, allowing for broader access and improved security for power users. This range of supported wallets, along with customization options, helps developers create user-friendly login experiences that match the look and feel of their app, ultimately making Stellar more accessible to new and returning users.\n\nOnce a user logs in, they are shown a profile modal. This modal includes useful features like sending and receiving tokens, viewing transaction history, seeing asset balances, and accessing on and off ramps. Features like asset swapping and viewing recent operations will be added soon. These built-in features allow users to interact with Stellar directly within the application without needing to jump to external tools or manage transactions manually, which improves user retention and creates a smoother, more complete Stellar app experience.\n\nUnder the hood, Blux provides a full set of custom React hooks like useBalance, useAccount, useTransactions, useOperations, and useSendTransaction, as well as many others. These hooks allow developers to pull real-time data from Horizon and Soroban without having to write boilerplate code or manage state manually. For teams that don‚Äôt use React, Blux also offers a vanilla JavaScript version with the same core features. Both versions are published on NPM and are fully open source. These tools give developers easier access to real-time Stellar data and allow for cleaner, more reliable app logic, helping developers of all skill levels build on Stellar faster and with fewer errors.\n\nAll apps built with Blux can be managed through the Blux Dashboard at https://dashboard.blux.cc. This is where developers can register their apps and generate their API keys, configure allowed domains, set up allowlists to make apps invite-only, and use blocklists to restrict access from specific accounts, regions, emails, or phone numbers. The dashboard also allows developers to change visual themes, add terms of service prompts, and control login options. These settings give developers full control over the behavior and accessibility of their apps, which increases security, enables experimentation, and gives app creators more confidence to build on Stellar.\n\nThe developer dashboard also includes a ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù tab that provides a snapshot of user activity. Developers can view how many users logged in over time, which wallets were used, where the users came from, and at what times they accessed the application. This data helps developers understand their audience and monitor usage trends, which is valuable for making improvements, pitching to investors, and building user-first Stellar apps that serve real needs.\n\nTo help onboard users who don‚Äôt have a wallet or don‚Äôt understand crypto, Blux supports logins via email and SMS. This feature uses OTPs and works even in test environments, allowing developers to quickly simulate flows during local development. By making it possible to log in without a wallet, Blux helps onboard non-technical users and opens the door to a wider audience that might otherwise be intimidated by crypto tools, increasing the potential reach of Stellar apps.\n\nBlux also supports login through passkeys, as well as social login providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and more. These accounts are linked to Stellar accounts behind the scenes, allowing users to sign and send transactions even if they don‚Äôt know anything about blockchain. This gives developers an easy way to build apps for mainstream users while still relying on the core Stellar tech stack, helping bring Stellar to people outside of the crypto-native crowd.\n\nThe documentation is being finalized and will walk developers through every step of integrating Blux, from installation to customization, including how to use all the hooks, helpers, and platform features. The goal is to provide a clear path for anyone who wants to use Stellar in their project. This improves developer onboarding, reduces confusion, and increases the chances that projects built on Stellar will succeed and stay active.\n\nBlux is fully open source, and all of its code is published across multiple repositories on GitHub. Unlike some wallet infrastructure tools like Privy, we believe in transparency and invite the Stellar community to look at how everything works, open issues, suggest improvements, or contribute code. This helps build trust in the tools powering Stellar apps and gives developers more confidence that the platform is secure, maintained, and future-proof.\n\nCustomization is a key priority in Blux. Developers can even define and plug in their own login methods if the built-in options don‚Äôt meet their needs. This flexibility ensures that Blux is compatible with any kind of Stellar app, whether it‚Äôs a DeFi tool, a payments platform, an NFT project, or something else entirely. Supporting such a wide range of use cases helps foster innovation in the Stellar ecosystem and ensures that developers aren‚Äôt limited by rigid tools.\n\nBlux is completely free to use for now. In the future, we plan to offer advanced features in the developer dashboard that will be part of a paid version. These features will not replace or restrict the existing free functionality and will be announced publicly when ready. Offering a freemium model ensures that everyone can use Blux without friction, while also giving power users the option to access advanced tools if they need them, which supports long-term sustainability of the platform and helps more professional apps grow on Stellar.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity across siloed blockchains. It is powered by a decentralized oracle relay network infrastructure and focuses on bridging assets securely and cost-effectively between EVM-compatible chains and Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nInteroperability has long been a challenge in blockchain development. Many existing solutions prioritize asset transfers between isolated chains, often introducing a single point of failure. While oracle-based inter-chain messaging protocols like Chainlink help relay data across chains, they primarily support EVM-based blockchains, leaving non-EVM ecosystems like Soroban without robust interoperability options.\n\nLiquidsFi addresses this gap by developing a secure and efficient EVM-Soroban interoperability data transmission oracle network and asset bridge.\n\nBy enabling seamless liquidity transfers between EVM chains and Soroban, LiquidsFi enhances capital efficiency, dApp accessibility, and overall adoption of Soroban-based assets. Users who previously relied on EVM networks for interoperability can now securely transfer assets and access DeFi opportunities on Soroban, ultimately driving higher on-chain activity and TVL growth.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe key features of LiquidsFi include:\n\n#### 1. Decentralized, Non-Custodial Liquidity protocol\n\n-   Powered by community-supplied on-chain liquidity\n    \n-   Fully non-custodial model enhances trust and transparency\n    \n-   Liquidity providers earn LP rewards and token incentives\n    \n-   Aligns token incentives with Stellar/Soroban adoption\n    \n\n#### 2. Dedicated EVM ‚Üî Soroban Interoperability\n\n-   Custom-built infrastructure for EVM-Soroban bridging\n    \n-   Supports Lock-and-Release + Lock-and-Mint mechanisms\n    \n-   Optimized for seamless token, NFT, and data transmission\n    \n\n#### 3. Multichain Token Integration API\n\n-   Projects can easily integrate their tokens into the bridge\n    \n-   Includes support for:\n    \n    -   Metadata registration\n        \n    -   Custom minting configurations\n        \n    -   Liquidity pair initialization\n        \n    -   Bridge fee customization\n        \n\n#### 4. On-Chain Oracle Data Bridging\n\n-   Enables oracle-based data transmission between chains\n    \n-   Ideal for DeFi, analytics, and real-world data applications\n    \n-   Supports custom data routing for advanced dApp use cases\n    \n\n#### 5. NFT Bridging with Metadata Support\n\n-   Native support for NFTs + metadata across chains\n    \n-   Allows Soroban-based NFT platforms to access EVM marketplaces and vice versa\n    \n\n#### 6. Infrastructure Layer for Soroban Projects\n\n-   Simplifies cross-chain functionality for Stellar-based dApps\n    \n-   Helps non-EVM-native tokens and protocols become multichain\n    \n-   Boosts accessibility and liquidity reach for Soroban projects\n    \n\nEcosystem Impact\n\nThe impact LiquidsFi has on the Stellar ecosystem is as follows:\n\n#### For Developers:\n\n-   Launch Soroban-native tokens with built-in cross-chain functionality\n    \n-   Access liquidity and user bases on major EVM chains\n    \n-   Build oracle-powered dApps with real-time multichain data feeds\n    \n\n#### For the Stellar Network:\n\n-   Drives TVL and active usage of Soroban smart contracts\n    \n-   Expands Stellar‚Äôs role as a DeFi-capable Layer 1 beyond payments\n    \n-   Encourages native project growth with first-class interoperability support\n    \n\n#### For the Community:\n\n-   Incentivizes participation through LP staking and liquidity mining\n    \n-   Offers transparent, non-custodial infrastructure for secure asset bridging\n    \n-   Enables NFT creators, dApp builders, and DeFi developers to grow multichain",

The core focus of our approach is participation incentivization ‚Äî ensuring early adoption, user retention, and sustained ecosystem engagement.\n\n#### 1. Liquidity Mining Incentives\n\nAt the heart of LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and non-custodial bridge, which relies on active liquidity provision. To bootstrap liquidity and reward early users, LiquidsFi will launch a liquidity mining rewards program. This initiative will:\n\n-   Attract early adopters by providing yield opportunities on idle stablecoins and other assets\n    \n-   Boost available liquidity for seamless cross-chain asset bridging\n    \n-   Foster long-term engagement by rewarding consistent participation\n    \n\n#### 2. Point-Based Token Rewards\n\nLiquidsFi will implement a point-based token reward system, similar to a loyalty or cashback program. Users earn points (redeemable for tokens) when bridging assets through the protocol. This system is designed to:\n\n-   Incentivize repeat usage of the bridge\n    \n-   Improve user retention through ongoing rewards\n    \n-   Encourage organic growth as users are rewarded for continued activity\n    \n\n#### 3. Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem Integration\n\nTo accelerate adoption, LiquidsFi will form strategic partnerships within the Soroban and Stellar ecosystems. These efforts include:\n\n-   Integrations with Soroban-based dApps and DeFi platforms to expand use cases\n    \n-   Cross-marketing collaborations with ecosystem projects to leverage community overlap\n    \n-   Active participation in Soroban and Stellar growth initiatives and hackathons\n    \n\n#### 4. Community Engagement & Incentivized Programs\n\nLiquidsFi will prioritize community-driven growth by launching targeted engagement campaigns, including:\n\n-   Bounty Programs: Security and community bounties to encourage contributions and feedback\n    \n-   Marketing Collaborations: Partnering with KOLs, crypto influencers, and media outlets to amplify visibility\n    \n-   Education & Awareness Campaigns: Hosting AMAs, producing educational content, and organizing onboarding workshops to grow the user base\n    \n\nBy combining liquidity incentives, token-based rewards, strategic partnerships, and community engagement, LiquidsFi is positioned to achieve rapid adoption, deep protocol liquidity, and strong developer and user traction from the outset. This multi-pronged strategy ensures both immediate impact and long-term sustainability.",
