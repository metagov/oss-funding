A fitness ecosystem for everyone everywhere, making a change stride by stride.","What is Stride?

Stride currently consists of 2 applications forming a fitness ecosystem, the idea is to reach as many people and effectively make a difference in as many peoples lives as possible no matter how small that change may be. To do that we decided to move forward with a dual application approach making it more accessible to anyone and everyone. So let’s jump into both of our applications and what their purposes are:  

Stride Native App (Also considered the Pro app)

-   Available on both GooglePlay and Apple App Store
    
-   Currently a MVP Beta built to allow users to earn $STRIDE airdrop points beginning there fitness journey as well as socialise.
    

What do we intend to build it into?

-   A fitness application that will be a better solution to fitness enthusiasts than current traditional apps like Strava.
    
-   Consisting of features such as: Fitness tracking, advanced analytics, AI Fitness plans, PVP Racing, Hardware integrations, and a dynamic reward system, rewarding users for there efforts in ways that traditional apps simply don’t.  
    

Stride Lite Mini App (Our Lite Version)

-   Available currently on Telegram
    
-   Coming soon to LINE Messenger App (We have been accepted to have early access to LINE’s SDK for there soon too launch Mini App store, allowing us to be of the first applications to launch to 250 million LINE Messenger users!)
    
-   Currently a Beta built to allow users to walk to earn in game currency and spend this in game currency to enter cash raffles.
    
-   The idea is to keep the application simple, fun and very rewarding, making it attractive enough to those who might not be interested in fitness but convincing them to partake and with time maybe even upgrade to Stride Pro and take there fitness journey to the next level!
    
-   Launching Stride Lite on Fitness apps has allowed us to tap into a completely new market for the fitness applications which non of our competitors have and thus allowing us to already reach hundreds of thousands of users in just a couple months while in beta stage!

It serves as an oracle for projects like prediction markets, insurance protocols, derivatives, and cross-chain bridges, providing data ranging from cryptocurrency prices to sports and political events.","Stellar soroban contracts are currently being used for onChain contract development. I have done some initial work in this github repo(https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle) which i plan on expanding.

-   OnChain Optimistic Oracle (OOO) contract
    
    -   The OOO is used to assert truths about the world which are verified using an optimistic escalation game.
        
    -   Core idea: an asserter makes a statement about a truth, calling ""assertTruth"". If this statement is not challenged, it is taken as the state of the world. If challenged, it is arbitrated using the Data verification engine or if configured, an escalation manager. Escalation managers enable integrations to define their own security properties and tradeoffs, enabling the notion of ""sovereign security"".
        
-   OnChain Voting Oracle contract
    
    -   Since all transactions are public we have to use extra tricks to keep some things temporarily hidden. Let’s say we need input like an answer to a quiz or a move in a game from a group of players. We don’t want these players to be able to just watch the blockchain for their competitors’ answers. What we’ll do is have everyone hash their answer and submit that first (the commit). Next, everyone will submit their real answer (the reveal) and we can prove on-chain that it hashes to the committed value. This interaction is handled by the Voting Oracle contract in soroban
        
-   OnChain Staking Contract
    
    -   Staking contract enabling XLM to be locked up by stakers to earn a pro rata share of a fixed emission rate. This contract also handles the staking, unstaking and reward retrieval logic. There won't be any new XLM token generated, but the yield will be generated based on the asserter/disputer lost staked. Tentative staking interface below;
        
            #[derive(Debug)]
            pub struct VoterStake {
                stake: u128,                           // XLM staked by the staker.
                pending_unstake: u128,                 // XLM in unstake cooldown period, waiting to be unstaked.
                pending_stakes: HashMap<u32, u128>,    // If a voter stakes during an active reveal, stake is pending.
                rewardspaidper_token: u128,          // Internal tracker used in the calculation of pro-rata share of rewards.
                outstanding_rewards: u128,             // Accumulated rewards that have not yet been claimed.
                unapplied_slash: i128,                 // Used to track unapplied slashing in the case of bisected rounds.
                nextindexto_process: u64,            // The next request index that a staker is susceptible to be slashed on.
                unstake_time: u64,                     // Time that a staker can unstake. Used to determine if cooldown has passed.
                delegate: Option<String>,              // Address a staker has delegated to. The delegate can commit/reveal/claimRestake rewards.
            }
        
    
-   OnChain Reward Distribution contract
    
    -   Reward Distribution is a sub contract that Staking Contract inherits. Rewards can either be distributed per epoch or based on the end of challenge period. The unstaking of reward will have to go through a cooldown period
        

-   Export a pluggable interface for other Soroban contracts to use it easily
    
    -   Build necessary adaptars for the oracle contract interface to be easily pluggable in other projects
        
    -   The adapters can be universally used or be changed subject to a specific project need
        

-   OffChain Data Verification Engine (DVE)
    
    -   This is an offChain component which will be written in Rust to read/write to Stellar blockchain
        
    -   DVE Purpose: Resolves disputes in the Soroban optimistic oracle by verifying disputed data.
        
    -   Dispute Process: Ex: A price request is submitted to the DVE, triggering a vote among SOO stakers.
        
    -   Voting Period: Voting lasts x hrs
        
    -   Voting Criteria: SOO stakers use off-chain price feeds to guide their votes.
        
    -   Final Price: The DVE aggregates votes to determine the final asset price for the given timestamp.",https://www.figma.com/deck/pEr2MvlTAa5ErIVBuxQ7GG/Soroban-Opt.-Oracle?node-id=1-32&t=pmd69aKDfgZ30lq4-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1,"Expected success criteria by the end of the grant;

-   Integrate with 3 different Stellar projects enabling real-time data flow from the oracle to their platform
    
-   Have > 10 stakers consistently voting and earning rewards using our system
    
-   The rewards and security of the system grows as the project grows
    
-   Become a standard for onChain dispute handling on Stellar ecosystem
    
-   Keep the system economically secure and have strong security against spams, bots and malicious users.",https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle,https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7_pCM9KtPEXOV7B7H0oykRZ4mDlIiew/view?usp=sharing,Yes,"Engage the Stellar Developer Ecosystem:

-   Build early traction and trust by connecting with Stellar ecosystem founders and key developers.
    
-   Foster relationships with influential projects within the Stellar ecosystem and integrate them into the SOO service.
    

Community Outreach through Developer Networks:

-   Collaborate with Stellar-focused developer communities to promote the adoption of the SOO framework.
    
-   Launch small bounty programs to incentivize the creation and use of SOO service
    

Encourage XLM holders to stake their token for rewards:

-   with SOO one can earn rewards by voting on correct source of truth. This can be a big incentive for XLM holders to stake and earn extra yield on the side","The Stellar Optimistic Oracle (SOO) is currently in the process of being deployed to the Stellar Testnet. This integration is pivotal for expanding the range of use cases that can be built on Stellar, from DeFi (decentralized finance) applications to synthetic assets, prediction markets, and real-world data tracking.

As part of this deployment, we are conducting several test flights to rigorously test the functionality and reliability of the Optimistic Oracle within the Stellar Testnet environment. These test flights involve the deployment of specific smart contracts that simulate real-world data requests, dispute resolutions, and data verification processes. In addition to the technical deployment, I am also in active communication with several other Stellar-funded projects that are well-positioned to leverage the capabilities of the Stellar Optimistic Oracle. These projects span across multiple sectors, including finance, data marketplaces, and NFT platforms, and could significantly benefit from integrating this oracle technology. The goal is to explore collaborative opportunities where SOO can be incorporated into existing Stellar-based applications or be used to create new innovative products that require reliable and decentralized data feeds. These projects are looking for ways to incorporate off-chain data for use in:

-   Automated price feeds for decentralized trading or financial derivatives.
    
-   Synthetic assets that track the value of real-world commodities and assets.
    
-   Event-driven smart contracts in prediction markets or decentralized insurance.
    
-   Cross-chain interoperability, where data from other blockchains or traditional systems can be fed into Stellar-based ecosystems.","1.  [Deliverable 1: MVP]

It is operational, regulated and revenue producing, having launched in September 2024. It makes real estate debt and equity accessible; faster, more efficiently, and more transparently than traditional Companies.","As regulated platform, Verseprop has already completed its first tokenized real estate credit transaction in the UK and is now starting to integrate into several private real estate companies with the ability to bring scale to the Stellar ecosystem. Existing market coverage includes UK (assets & distribution) and UAE (distribution) with a flexible model to offer equity, debt or hybrid structures.

Please see link to existing UK regulatory permissions and signed LOI with VARA regulated Broker-Dealer. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FX_cwhGrvHG06vtzmymDZA-_btoNdtza?usp=sharing  
  
Our platform offers two distinct services tailored to meet specific client needs:

  
Service #1 Principal-Led Solution: This model focuses on sourcing, underwriting and distributing tokenized real estate equity and debt opportunities through the Verseprop platform. It gives us the ability to target specific sponsors or schemes, i.e. one-off vs programmatic and is particularly attractive for small, medium sized real estate developers / operators who require credit but cannot access through traditional channels, i.e. banks.

  
Service #2 White-Label Solution: This is where our technology solution operates under the client's brand, broadening their investor reach and reducing their costs. The solution is flexible and scalable, delivering a fully branded experience while also providing access to VerseProp’s investor network. It addresses regulatory challenges and streamlines processes such as KYC, investor engagement, management, and payments.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u22pBSR_BzXBppQowX-13ZFjmyxzxd0J/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112480416795641360484&rtpof=true&sd=true,"Our Target within 12 months of Mainnet Deployment  

-   Tokenize 30-35 commercial assets on Stellar. Each asset £1-5m.
    
-   £100 million in tokenized property assets.
    
-   Facilitate c. 500-1,000 primary transactions and an additional 5,000-10,000 transactions for dividend distribution and on-chain management.

-   Continue developing partnerships to strengthen distribution networks, enhance credibility, and ensure scalability for future operations adding a minimum of 1 (and possibly 2) locations to support UK and UAE hubs.
    

Benefits for Stellar Ecosystem:  
  
Firstly, we are able to bring immediate scale to the Stellar and, importantly, a diverse client base using our White Label product. This will not only contribute to increased ledger activity and attract new users and liquidity to the network, but also strengthen Stellar's reputation as a preferred blockchain for RWA tokenization.

  
Secondly, by having Stellar as one of our strategic blockchain partners, we can help drive attention to XLM as a leader in the real estate sector and further showcase blockchain's scalability with practical, real-world applications. Through this integration, we will bring awareness and an untapped user base to the Stellar ecosystem by engaging with developers, lenders, real estate companies and fund, fostering innovation and driving adoption of Stellar for tokenized assets. 

  
Lastly, we believe the UK is poised to grow in significance as a Digital Asset Hub based on regulatory changes and appetite from government. Our platform is strategically positioned to deliver a market-leading solution tailored specifically to real estate debt and equity, offering unique value to the Stellar ecosystem from domain experts.",https://www.verseprop.com,https://app.storylane.io/share/l2lj2i6qap6p,https://share.vidyard.com/watch/WBVfvQTVsB8RteA1dsw8Sd?,Yes,"Structuring: Start the process of moving asset structures offshore to take advantage of tax benefits and leverage newly emerging tokenization legislation. We currently operate a UK SPV but there is growing demand from international investors for UK based assets. This is being done in collaboration with CMS Law.

Satellite Office: Open satellite office in UAE to support our collaboration agreement and regional expansion. Participating in the Fintech trade mission in Hong Kong to establish distribution in Asia via strategic partnerships, akin to efforts in the UAE. We are currently being assisted by DIFC DIFC | Leading Financial Hub in the MEASA Region and HKinvest InvestHK - Government Department of Foreign Direct Investment | InvestHK  
Leverage Existing Network: The primary focus of our Go-To-Market Plan has been our - domain expertise, where we can leverage our existing networks with developers, real estate companies and funds giving us access to high quality assets, deal flow and investors. We also rely on a proven track record, having been one of the first platforms to issued tokenized real estate credit with further case studies to follow for both the Marketplace and White Label service.  
  
Other forms of customer acquisition include Community Building and Education, where we foster engagement with speakerships and educational content on tokenized real estate. We will be speaking at a number of conferences including Rosenblatt, Digital Asset Regulation Summit and a number of private steering groups with real estate companies.","Since our last update, Verseprop has made significant progress in regulatory compliance, product development, and strategic partnerships, positioning itself as a market leader in the real estate tokenization sector.

As referenced in our last submission, Verseprop has now formally signed a broker-dealer LOI to offer compliant and scalable services in the UAE, which will sit alongside its FCA Appointed Representative status in the UK ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.  
  
Since launching in September 2024, Verseprop has made significant progress in regulatory compliance, product development, and strategic partnerships, positioning itself as a market leader in the real estate tokenization space.

It has already completed a tokenized credit transaction for £240,000 and started to onboard several private real estate companies. In addition, Verseprop’s white-label service empowers real estate businesses to adopt blockchain technology under their branding. Please see link:  
nexus.mavryk.org/contract/KT1CUKh4VGXuT1vJqgebNwFJZ3CmBRBb2Hm3

Verseprop’s collaborations with globally recognized organizations ensure our platform remains at the forefront of compliance and innovation. Some examples include:

-   RICS Technology Partner: Aligning with global real estate standards.
    
-   Strata Global: Principal firm overseeing our Verseprop's regulation as an FCA approved Appointed Representative.
    
-   VARA UAE: Collaboration with a Dubai-based partner regulated by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority.
    
-   Amina Bank (ex Seba): On-ramp and off ramping for both individuals and corporates.
    
-   CMS Law: Part of the EquIP accelerator programme from one of the world's largest law firms.
    

  
The UK property market alone offers substantial potential. The market for tokenized real estate in the UK is still in its early stages but rapidly expanding, driven by the increasing demand for alternative investments, exposure to real estate and blockchain-based solutions. With £1.3 trillion in total UK commercial real estate assets and a growing interest in alternative investments, the potential market size is substantial, especially when the model can be replicated in multiple jurisdictions, which Verseprop intends to do.  

Verseprop already has an existing network of private wealth investors (c.75 with the ability to invest £5k up to £5m in a single deal), however where our model is truly compelling is in its integration with existing businesses. This approach allows us to rapidly scale both the volume of assets brought on-chain and the number of users.  

We also continue to build our Partnerships through broker-dealer relationships that support our growth ambitions and will be part of a trade mission to Hong Kong later this year, as part of an invite from innovative UK Fintechs.  

Our milestones reflect Verseprop's commitment to delivering a compliant, scalable, and innovative platform for real estate tokenization.","Develop Security Token Architecture Using Stellar

There are two big work packages we're going to build in parallel:

The first is to develop a carbon sinking smart contract to enable other Soroban developers to automate compensating for CO₂ emissions through their own contracts, by sending financial support to verified ecosystem restoration projects. We also need to add support for Soroban in our backend so that there is no functional difference between sinking carbon through classic Stellar and through smart contracts. This will introduce the flexibility we need to appeal to builders who are increasingly using Soroban in their products.

  
The second package is to finalize the development of our dApp where individuals and small businesses can sink carbon. We have a list of UX issues to improve, and want to do a second round of usability testing to end up with a product that people love to use. This includes communicating clearly how we have a positive impact on climate and biodiversity, because most of our customers have no prior experience with the voluntary carbon market.",https://github.com/stellarcarbon/sc-website/blob/develop/docs/architecture.md,"We define our success in terms of integrity and the volume of carbon sunk. The impact projects that are supported through Stellarcarbon need to have a science-based, quantifiable positive impact on biodiversity, climate, and vulnerable communities. Without that integrity, other metrics don’t matter.

The volume of carbon sunk through Stellarcarbon determines the magnitude of the collective impact made by our customers. This volume is most meaningful when it wouldn’t have happened through other means, or when it replaces the use of eco-credits of lesser integrity than ours. When volume moves from another high-integrity service to Stellarcarbon, it’s still positive for the Stellar ecosystem, but it represents less of an environmental benefit. Finally, there’s the risk of compensation being used for emissions that could have been avoided or reduced at a similar cost, which is detrimental to our success.

We have calculated the minimum volume that is required for the longevity of our project. It is determined by the break even point where our gross profit equals our operational expenses minus payroll (which can be zero if needed). With our current pricing model, we need to sell 750 tonnes of carbon per year to cover our costs. Our target is to reach this amount 6 months after the launch date.",https://test.stellarcarbon.io/,https://github.com/stellarcarbon/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX9ar7vkPVQ,Yes,"Stellarcarbon targets two fundamentally distinct customer segments: retail users and integration partners. While each segment is multifaceted, we can offer a personalized approach to integration partners, and have to think about retail users in terms of profiling and personas.

Retail segment

We define our retail segment as: the customers that want to access eco-credits to claim the environmental benefit for themselves, and who want to interact with Stellarcarbon through our dApp.

Retail users on Stellar

People who already have a non-custodial Stellar wallet or are interested in installing one, experience the least onboarding friction. They don’t have to create any accounts, and the journey from landing on our dApp the first time to sinking their first carbon has taken our pilot users less than two minutes on average. Their second time usually goes even faster.

Our main task in marketing to this audience is to answer questions that are not about Stellar: What is the voluntary carbon market? What does it mean for a carbon credit to have “community and biodiversity benefits”? Why would I spend money on this? How can I see that my contribution actually has a positive impact?

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   create better informative content about ReFi and Stellarcarbon
    
-   publish testimonials by our pilot customers
    
-   host and participate in X spaces and Discord events, working together with Lumen Loop and Stellar Global
    
-   leverage our early adopters as ambassadors
    

ReFi enthusiasts

There is a dedicated and growing community of crypto-savvy people who are passionate about regenerative finance (ReFi). They have an affinity for other blockchains, most notably Celo, Polygon, and Solana. We want to introduce them into the Stellar ecosystem, and pave the way for other ReFi pioneers building on Stellar, such as Geld Network and netzero.kiwi.

We have been active in the ReFi community for several years (as individuals), on X and Discord. Tribalism has been a barrier to promoting Stellar and Stellarcarbon on some of the most active Discord servers. Through our network, we have gained access to some more chain-agnostic venues (thanks Evan!), which will help Stellarcarbon be part of the conversation.

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   announce our launch in the CARBON copy newsletter
    
-   become a highlighted project on Giveth
    
-   engage with the ReFi DAO community
    
-   provide tutorials on our website on how to set up a Stellar wallet and bridge stablecoins
    
-   post regular updates on the impact projects we support
    

New-to-crypto users

One of our pilot customers was a first-time dApp user, who had also never used a non-custodial wallet before. We onboarded him from scratch, providing limited wallet installation and on-ramping instructions. Including setup, sinking carbon took around 15 minutes the first time, and 5 minutes the second time. Overall, this was a good experience for everyone involved and we expect him to be a repeat customer.

The most important characteristic of customers coming from outside the crypto space is that they don’t want to pay with digital assets. To serve this audience, we’ll need to enable debit card payments through a payments processor. The second is that they’re not that interested in the technology, and experience managing and securing their own keypair as friction.

We can smoothen this journey by building in support for smart wallets with passkeys and/or account recovery (SEP-30). Stellarcarbon can take care of account creation, reserves, and fees, without having to become a custodial wallet provider. Such a solution is out of scope for this submission, and we’re considering it as a post-launch addition. When we are ready to onboard new-to-crypto users, we will focus on simple, relatable campaigns that emphasize the positive environmental impact rather than blockchain technology.

Integration segment

The integration segment consists of builders that want to automate their interactions with Stellarcarbon. They can give their users access to eco-credits, claim the environmental benefit for themselves, or do both. These builders are already on Stellar/Soroban, or are willing to join the ecosystem.

Our strategy for engaging with integration partners is tailored. We have the capacity for 1-on-1 conversations with builders who are interested in integrating Stellarcarbon into their software. One of the uncertainties for potential integrators is how much demand for eco-credits there will be within their user base. Having our own retail customers really helps to prove the demand to them. We haven’t been actively reaching out to other builders for the past year or so, and are going to ramp up these efforts paired with our dApp launch.

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   add an overview of software integration opportunities on our website
    
-   clarify that we can split our sales margin with integration partners
    
-   show builders of end-user applications how easy it is to integrate Stellarcarbon into their checkout flow
    
-   ask developers of wallets that don’t currently support dApps how we can help to give their users access
    
-   reach out to infrastructure providers with an offer to help track their emissions (using tools like CodeCarbon) and reach carbon neutrality
    
-   offer a bounty to use DeFi yield for automatic carbon retirements
    
-   participate in industry events and increase our visibility there","'-   People are already using our earliest demo version app on mainnet right now. We have more than $240 revenue just from demos, 15 distinct pilot users doing 29 transactions in total. This does not include testnet stats, since we don’t preserve data across testnet resets. To verify these stats, see the transaction history in our API, or on stellar.expert.
    
-   GiveCredit will use our Soroban contract to further automate carbon credit retirements from the donations of their users.
    
-   We have been approached by the lead dev of DeFindex (PaltaLabs), indicating a clear demand for real world eco-assets on Soroban.","[Deliverable 1] Soroban Interface MVP

-   Develop the full sink carbon contract as specified in the technical architecture. Launch a CARBON/USDC liquidity pool on testnet Soroswap. Develop a replenish pool feature in the Stellarcarbon backend.
    
-   How to measure completion: contract repo is available on our GitHub featuring the sink carbon contract. The contract can be deployed and invoked in a local sandbox. Our liquidity pool is visible in Soroswap. Whenever the CARBON price there deviates significantly from the price returned by our API, the pool will be automatically rebalanced within minutes.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 8 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 60 hours development + 60 hours testing x $100/hr = $12,000
    

[Deliverable 2] dApp frontend UX, content, and styling

-   Testing has revealed numerous improvements that we want to make to the UX. Most revolve around input validation and error handling. We have identified what we can do to guide users through a successful sink carbon flow. Several testers have asked for emissions estimates (e.g. calculators) to be further integrated into our dApp. We’ll rewrite some of our text content and improve on the accessibility of the page layouts.
    
-   How to measure completion: the dApp looks and feels complete. A tester can use test.stellarcarbon.io to sink carbon on testnet and manage their account. Some data connections may still be mocked at this stage.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 8 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 50 hours development + 40 hours testing x $100/hr = $9,000
    

These two objectives can be completed independently and in parallel. We’ll have two developers working on them simultaneously, and there are no direct dependencies between the deliverables.","[Deliverable 3] dApp usability improvements

-   We’ll launch the full dApp frontend on testnet at the beginning of this milestone. Our previous testers and newly recruited ones will be provided with a testing protocol, which we’ll use to gather feedback and sort out any remaining issues.
    
-   How to measure completion: a usability testing report will be provided.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 12 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 40 hours usability testing + 40 hours iteration x $100/hr = $8,000
    

[Deliverable 4] Automate retirements for testing

-   After sinking carbon, the sinking transaction needs to trigger a “retirement” of carbon credits in the Verra Registry. In our testnet app, the corresponding amount of credits currently isn’t retired because the Verra Registry lacks a testing environment for us to develop against. We want to mock this part of the retirement process in our own backend to provide a testing experience that is comparable with the real Verra Registry connection.
    
-   How to measure completion: pending retirement balances are automatically retired (after some delay) in our dApp.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 10 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 30 hours development + 20 hours testing x $100/hr = $5,000
    

[Deliverable 5] Complete Soroban Interface

-   After deploying our smart contract to testnet, we’ll start integration testing with at least one partner. This will deliver us the insights we need to improve the contract and its documentation. Support for the contract will be added to our backend, including event ingestion and their post-processing into data structures that are compatible with our classic Stellar data.
    
-   How to measure completion: sink carbon events (i.e. atomic swaps with metadata) that are generated in Soroban are visible in our testnet API and in the dApp.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 12 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 45 hours development + 25 hours testing x $100/hr = $7,000
    

While working on this milestone, we will also increase our engagement with the Stellar community. There will be testing opportunities for end-users as well as for developers. As we have done in the past, we’ll want to on-ramp these testers as pilot customers and integration partners.","[Deliverable 6] Soroban Integration on mainnet

-   Before we can launch on mainnet, we want our contract to be audited and well documented. Since it ties into a larger system, we also need to document the integration between the Soroban events and our backend and the API it exposes. We’ll launch the Soroswap liquidity pool on mainnet. The automatic replenishment feature will be adapted for and deployed in our mainnet backend. We’ll also develop a backup mechanism that publishes ingested contract events in our public data repository.
    
-   How to measure completion: it’s possible to obtain and sink carbon through Soroban contract invocations. The resulting events will be visible in our dApp, API, and will show up in our data repo after some time. An audit report of the contract has been published by a reputable 3rd party (provided we have been granted audit credits from the SDF Audit Bank).
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 20 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 40 hours development + 20 hours testing + 40 hours audit process x $100/hr = $10,000
    

[Deliverable 7] Fully automate retirements for mainnet

-   There are some tricky parts in automating retirements for mainnet. We currently still have a human-in-the-loop process, because errors made in the Verra Registry are immutable. The logic for processing retirements has been specified, but we have yet to identify all edge cases. We’ll develop the solution incrementally, starting with the simple cases for which we haven’t needed manual intervention, and proceeding towards the most challenging case of batching fractional retirements from multiple users into a community certificate.
    
-   How to measure completion: sinking transactions will show as retired in our dApp as soon as possible, within a couple of minutes when we can generate an individual certificate. Check the Verra Registry to verify that the retirement has actually happened. Individual certificates will also be emailed to eligible accounts directly by Verra.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 24 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 50 hours development + 20 hours testing x $100/hr = $9,000
    

[Deliverable 8] Launch our dApp (retail shop)

-   This is a festive moment: we’ll go live with our dApp on www.stellarcarbon.io, replacing our old website. There should not be much left to do; all the features and content have been completed in other deliverables. We’ll configure our CI/CD pipeline to deploy the production version of the dApp, do some manual testing, and update our DNS records. After we have fully launched, we’ll continue to focus our efforts on marketing and business development. Onward!
    
-   How to measure completion: our dApp is live and fully functional on www.stellarcarbon.io.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 24 weeks after award announcement.

Developers and non-technical users in the Stellar ecosystem face significant challenges when setting up real-time event tracking for on-chain and cross-chain activities. The process can take up to a week, requiring them to:

-   Understand API flows.
    
-   Set up servers and integrate with Stellar APIs.
    
-   Write custom code for each specific event, which varies by product and workflow.
    

Over time, managing this setup at scale becomes increasingly difficult due to:

-   High costs and resource demands.
    
-   Challenges in tracking failed or pending transactions, unusual activities, and system health.
    

While developers have the technical capability, this process is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and lacks a simple plug-and-play solution. Non-technical users, on the other hand, are left with no feasible options to implement such solutions.

Solution:

Sorobanhooks is an all-in-one automation and real-time event tracking platform tailored for the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem. It simplifies and streamlines operations with:

-   Plug-and-play webhooks and integrations with third-party platforms like Slack or Telegram.
    
-   Customizable workflows with real-time event data and analytics dashboards.
    
-   Cross-chain activity tracking and reporting tools for seamless scalability.
    
-   Additional features like smart contract testing and deployment in just a few clicks.
    

This solution drastically reduces the time, cost (up to $100k in year depending on scale), and effort for developers and product owners, enabling them to scale their projects efficiently while maintaining real-time oversight and control.

Product & Features:

1.  Soroban Event Notifier to track contract events,
    
1.  Soroban Transaction Tracker for live updates on transaction statuses,
    
1.  Soroban Balance Watcher to monitor account balances,
    
1.  Soroban Contract Deployer for seamless contract deployment
    
1.  Soroban Cross-Chain Bridge Monitor to track cross-chain transfers.
    

How to Use:

1.  Sign Up: The developer signs up on Sorobanhooks and creates an account.
    
1.  Create a New Project: The developer creates a new project within Sorobanhooks to track event or deploy smart contract.
    
1.  Configure Webhooks: They set up webhooks for specific events, such as contract deployment, token transfers, or balance changes.
    
1.  Deploy Contract or import : Using the Sorobanhooks interface, the developer deploys their Soroban smart contract or import
    
1.  Real-Time Monitoring: As events occur (e.g., a token transfer or contract state change), the webhooks automatically notify the developer’s endpoint with real-time updates.
    
1.  Action Automation: The developer can automate workflows based on these notifications, such as executing additional contract actions or triggering external services
    

Demand From Market :

1.  Developer Bottlenecks : Developers want a plug-and-play solution to automate repetitive tasks like event tracking, transaction monitoring, and smart contract deployments, freeing up resources for core development work.
    
1.  Expanding Ecosystem : A platform that bridges multi-chain monitoring and automation within Stellar and Soroban is critical for this growing audience.
    
1.  Inclusion of Non-Tech Users : A tool like Sorobanhooks simplifies access for non-technical users, making blockchain technology more inclusive and enabling faster adoption.
    
1.  Current Market Gaps : A centralized, scalable platform eliminates these pain points by providing an all-in-one solution for automation, reporting, and monitoring.
    
1.  Expanded Demand with Mobile & Web Push Notification Integrations: In addition to the real-time event monitoring and cross-chain tracking, there is increasing demand for mobile and web push notifications for seamless user engagement.This integration will allow users to set up their webhooks to automatically trigger push notifications, reducing the need for custom development and enhancing the flexibility of the platform.
    

Validation & Opportunities:

-   Early Feedback: Discussions with 10+ projects in the Stellar ecosystem have revealed that most lack the resources to build such tools in-house.
    
-   Adoption Potential: A streamlined solution that reduces time-to-market for blockchain projects can attract a broad spectrum of users, from small startups to enterprise-level players.
    
-   Cross-Chain integration with top platforms and dApps : Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos (IBC) Polkadot, Arbitrum, Celo, Cardano, Uniswap, Aave, Curve. Finance, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Wormhole, AnySwap, Chainlink, Balancer
    

Challengers for developers and businesses:

-   Lack of Technical Resources : Many of these projects had small teams with limited technical expertise, particularly in backend development or API integration.
    
-   Time-Consuming Development Process : Teams were spending 1-2 weeks building webhook systems, testing integrations, and troubleshooting issues instead of focusing on core product development.
    
-   Scaling Challenges : Projects that had implemented basic webhook systems were struggling with scalability as transaction volumes grew, leading to server crashes, delays, and high maintenance costs. Handling custom web and mobile push notification.
    
-   Difficulty Tracking Custom Events : Every project had unique workflows and required custom event triggers that were difficult to implement with existing tools.
    
-   Non-Technical User Challenges : Non-developer stakeholders in projects couldn’t easily stay informed about on-chain events without constant developer support.
    
-   Limited Monitoring for Cross-Chain Activity : Projects working on cross-chain interoperability couldn’t find tools that provided real-time tracking of asset transfers across chains.
    
-   Inadequate Reporting and Analytics : Basic webhook implementations didn’t offer dashboards or analytics, making it hard for teams to analyze trends or troubleshoot issues.
    
-   High Maintenance Costs : Projects that had built custom webhook systems faced high maintenance costs, including server hosting, debugging, and scaling infrastructure.
    

Why Our solution is necessary when many of the offered features can be easily implemented by developers :

-   Time-Saving: Developers spend weeks or months setting up real-time event monitoring, webhook infrastructure, and cross-chain integrations.
    
-   Resource Optimization : Building these features requires dedicated server infrastructure, reliable APIs, custom error handling, and cross-chain expertise—demanding resources that many startups and teams don’t have.
    
-   Scalability : Custom implementations are often difficult to scale as user traffic grows or workflows become more complex.
    
-   Maintenance and Reliability: Maintaining a custom-built webhook system requires constant monitoring, debugging, and updates—a significant drain on resources.
    
-   Multi-Feature Integration: Developers must implement multiple independent features, such as transaction tracking, balance monitoring, and cross-chain operations, which require unique implementations for each.
    
-   Accessibility for Non-Tech Users : Non-technical product owners and business teams cannot easily interpret or act on raw data from APIs and blockchain transactions.
    
-   Focus on Stellar and Soroban Ecosystem : Generic webhook tools lack tailored support for Stellar/Soroban’s unique workflows and requirements.
    

Unique Value Proposition :
