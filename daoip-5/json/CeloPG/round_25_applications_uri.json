Our main focus is to launch the initial pilot program in collaboration with the City of Split. Following recent discussions and adjustments to our initial strategy, we will proceed without incorporating stablecoins due to complexities identified. Instead, we will deploy an unlisted ERC20 token on the Celo network specifically for this pilot.\n\nUsers will be able to purchase this token via credit card directly within our application. The token's sole utility will be for donating to pre-approved local environmental projects listed within the platform. This approach simplifies the legal and technical requirements, allowing us to concentrate on delivering the core functionality: enabling citizen participation in funding local green initiatives.\n\nThe $5k grant from Regen Coordination Digital Public Goods will be allocated overwhelmingly to development efforts, covering the necessary technical work to build the token mechanism, integrate the credit card payment gateway, and refine the user interface for the pilot launch. Smaller amount of funds will be allocated to round management efforts.\n\nThis aligns with our agreement to prioritize development resources to ensure a successful pilot, which will serve as a foundation for future, potentially more complex, iterations involving on-chain matching and broader web3 integrations. We aim to demonstrate the viability of this model and gather user feedback to inform subsequent phases.",
