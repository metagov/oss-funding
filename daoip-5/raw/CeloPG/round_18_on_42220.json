The Golfo Dulce Bay is one of four tropical fjords in the world and the calving grounds of both the southern hemisphere and northern pacific humpback whales. Within its rich rainforest and coastal zones, Costa Rican culture, indigenous populations, and archeological sites reside. \n\nHistorically, the Osa Peninsula has been one of the most remote and less traveled places of Costa Rica, which has protected its abundant wildlife and culture. This is changing. In the past five years there has been increased interest in the peninsula for mass development and tourism projects, which threatens the rich biodiversity and culture that sets it apart from other regions of Costa Rica.  Without proper institutional infrastructure and planning in place, these activities could lead to significant damage to the Osa's ecosystem and local culture. \n\nIn addition to this, 35% of the local population lives in severe poverty, which in turn threatens the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as people resort to any possible means to make a living, often at the expense of the ecological wealth.  Without regenerative alternatives, people have turned to destructive practices such as deforestation, poaching, mining, unsustainable agriculture, prostitution, and other illegal activities, and often end up selling their land to developers, leaving irreversible effects on the ecosystem and communities.\n\nOver the past eight years, alongside this looming threat of unsustainable development, a powerful local movement to design a regenerative economy that protects and enhances the environment, creates health and wellbeing for communities and strengthens the cultural identity of the people has emerged in the Osa Peninsula. A major reflection of this was the collaborative creation and use of the “Regenerative Osa Systems Map”, led by a diverse group of local leaders and a US based NGO Regenerative Earth in 2015, and the creation of the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula (CEDPO), a partnership between the Institute of Rural Development (INDER), The Osa Territory Council (CTDR), and Regenerative Earth.\n\nTHE BIOREGIONAL PROJECT HISTORY -\n\nA major asset for the Osa Peninsula is that it has a government agency, INDER (Institute of Rural Development) whose sole purpose is to assist with regional development projects. However, the capital resources of INDER are not being fully utilized as many critical projects that address poverty, conservation, and sustainable livelihoods are deemed too high risk and lacking in the appropriate technical and social capacity to receive funding. This has rendered this valuable, accessible, local source of financing as relatively ineffective. This is also the case with Costa Rican and International Foundations and investment groups who seek to fund regenerative projects in the Osa Peninsula. Without proper support to strengthen the existing technical and social capacity, regional leaders and their potential projects may not be able to generate the critical momentum and financial backing needed to succeed in this ambitious journey.\n\nIn addition to this, another major asset for the Osa Peninsula is the Osa Territorial Council, a council made up of 60% civic representation and 40% government representation with an elected representative from every community, indigenous territory, and local government agency within the Osa Territory. This governance body is responsible for creating the Osa Territorial Development Plan and selecting the projects that INDER funds. Many of these projects are the ones that INDER is not able to fund due to a lack of capacity. Through a cohesive governance body representing the diverse voices of the Osa Peninsula, the Osa Territorial Council carries the collective vision and action plan for the future of the Peninsula, providing national and international funders in the region a pathway to collaborate around a locally driven vision and plan. \n\nDue to the above mentioned INDER, in 2020, requested that the Regenerative Earth team co-design and implement a capacity strengthening program, the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula, to strengthen the governance body of the Osa Territorial Council, develop a systems-based criteria for project selection, and develop and de-risk projects to greatly increase the quantity and quality of projects INDER and other investors can fund, to promote sustainable livelihoods based on the protection of biodiversity and preservation of local culture for this globally-significant region. \n\nThe approach recognizes that for a project (business, non-profit, organization, strategic network, or coalition) to merit funding, the teams and organizations behind them must have the capacity to assemble effective, logical, and feasible plans, and to provide confidence to funders that they can execute these plans. In the Osa Peninsula the limiting factor for projects to access funding, and for investors to find fundable projects, is this capacity. CEDPO integrates these local capacity-strengthening needs with national and international financing requirements to catalyze and strengthen a regenerative economy that is locally driven for this remarkable region.\n\nIn the spring of 2022 the Osa Territorial Council (CTDR), Institute of Rural Development (INDER), and Regenerative Earth launched CEDPO with six main objectives: \n\n- Strengthen the capacity of the Osa Territorial Council and its ability to be an effective governance body and voice for the people of the Osa Peninsula. \n- Strengthen the capacities of locally-led projects, businesses, and alliances in the Osa Peninsula that are selected through a systems-based criteria and promote a thriving rainforest and marine ecosystem, culture, community, and regenerative economy.\n- Connect projects with a broad network of universities, government Institutions, market channels, investors, and experts relevant to project needs. \n- Bridge gaps between projects seeking funds and funds seeking projects\n- Design a financially-sustainable, self-sufficient and regenerative funding model for the projects and program.\n- Monitor, evaluate, and learn from the program's effectiveness to inform future iterations in the Osa and in other locations globally.\n\nTHE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF THE OSA PENINSULA - El Centro Estratégico Desarrollo de la Península de Osa (CEDPO)\n\nCEDPO is currently a partnership agreement between INDER, The Osa Territorial Council, and Regenerative Earth (a US based 501c3) with the vision to establish in the near future a Costa Rican Foundation for CEDPO. The CEDPO board of directors voting members consists of the President of the Osa Territorial Council, the Executive Director of Regenerative Earth, and the Regional Director of INDER. We have a full time paid program coordinator who is from the region, manages the program on the ground, and reports to the CEDPO board. The board of directors must have consensus in any decisions or actions taken. This allows the whole of the Osa Territorial Council and its diverse set of local and indigenous voices to be an active participant in CEDPO and to approve any actions that CEDPO takes. \n\nOver the past three years CEDPO has strengthened the capacity of over two dozen projects that were selected by local leaders with a systems criteria and supported the Osa Territorial Council in creating its new six year territorial development plan in a way that incorporated the local citizens’ vision and needs. CEDPO also connected regional and national institutions, universities, NGOs, and resources to its selected projects and initiatives and through Regenerative Earth directly granted over $169,000 to these projects.\n\nTHE PROJECTS CEDPO HAS FUNDED \n\nBelow is a list of the projects CEDPO has funded through regrants. CEDPO also works with many other projects through capacity strengthening and connecting resources to those projects. \n\nStrengthening Cultural Systems, with families from the Ngäbe Community, from the Alto Laguna territory - Total Grant Awarded: $9,000 in 2023 and $90,000 2025 - The Ngöbe tribe lives in a territory at the heart of the Osa Peninsula and they struggle to maintain their cultural heritage. The Ngöbe’s vision is to become food sovereign, to generate revenue through agricultural production with native seeds, develop eco and cultural tourism within their territory, strengthen an indigenous woman’s artisanal cooperative, and create a school to pass on the ancestral wisdom from the elders to the youth. \n\nRaising Coral - Total Grant awarded: $16,000 - Raising Coral is a local organization that is researching and restoring the native coral reefs in the Golfo Dulce Bay. We supported their coral gardener training for local youth to be certified divers and to grow the coral in the Bay. \n\nPueblos Unidos Turismo Arqueológico - Total Grant Awarded: $15,330 - Revaluing the intangible cultural, environmental and archaeological heritage of El Progreso, Drake Bay and providing alternatives for local livelihoods to enhance the quality of life for the people and environment in the area.\n\nAromas De Osa - Grant awarded: $15,000 - Aromas de Osa LLC is a venture that aims to promote the cultivation and distribution of natural vanilla. They are training farmers in the Osa Peninsula to grow and cultivate high quality natural vanilla in agroforestry systems and have secured an MOU with a company based in the Netherlands to market the vanilla produced and invest in a vanilla production facility in the Osa Peninsula. \n\nAssociation of Artisans Collectors and Recyclers of the Osa Peninsula (ASAOSA) - Total Grants Awarded: $23,000 - Serving as the only recycling program in the Osa Peninsula. It is locally led, women driven, and incredibly under-resourced. CEDPO is supporting \n\nASAOSA in complying with health and safety regulations, improving infrastructure and processing efficiency, educational outreach to the community, and strengthening business and financial planning.\n\nFUTURE VISION\n\nThe CEDPO partners believe in the opportunity for the Osa Peninsula to be a model for the planet demonstrating world class conservation alongside sustainable livelihoods where humans and nature synergistically thrive together. With the increasing threat of climate change, these exemplar regions are needed now more than ever to inspire a new economy and way of living on the Earth. \n\nOver the next three years CEDPO hopes to achieve six main objectives: \n\n- Establish a Costa Rican foundation for CEDPO run by the preexisting board of directors with potential new directors onboarded. We hope to have at least two full time employees - one social capacity strengthener and one technical capacity strengthener. We also hope that this can become a community led financing facility that generates permanent financing for capacity strengthening and project investments in the Osa Peninsula.\n- Continued updating of the Regenerative Osa Systems Map to serve as a guide for project selection and territorial planning. \n- Strengthened governance body of the Osa Territorial Council to be able to effectively incorporate the diversity of citizen voices in the Osa Peninsula. \n- Strengthened capacity of projects selected through a systems criteria by the Osa Territorial Council \n- Continued grant making in priority projects \n- Strengthened networks between projects and preexisting funders and capacity strengthening organizations. \n\nWe’d like to use the Gitcoin funds to create a Costa Rican Foundation for CEDPO, so that all of our funds are being managed locally and transparently. We think this will greatly increase CEDPO’s capacity to receive funding from a broader set of donors, to hire employees, and to develop a locally led organization. We also are being challenged by our current donors to match their funds for 2025, so we would apply the Gitcoin funds to these matching funds. \n","lastUpdated":0},"recipient":"0xf26afEFcb1FD04eade3de672Af487Aaf96d5f276"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreieryphf6pakdkgihcuoug6ecpbm54u7aruqsmesns7xltih4as44i","projects":[{"name":"El Centro Estratégico Desarrollo de la Península de Osa (CEDPO)","id":"0x5aed3b2ee44b10f025abfba88b48f7fb7f51a9e1fde5d9ba931a03d7a887470a","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"El Centro Estratégico Desarrollo de la Península de Osa (CEDPO)","website":"https://regenerativeearth.org/osa-peninsula-regenerative-economy-lab/","createdAt":1729703294166,"credentials":{},"description":"ABOUT THE BIOREGION\n\nThe Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, containing 2.5% of the world’s biodiversity and inspiring National Geographic magazine to call it “the most biologically intense place on Earth.” The peninsula features one of the longest remaining undeveloped primary rainforests and largest mangrove wetlands on the pacific coast in Central America.

We also are being challenged by our current donors to match their funds for 2025, so we would apply the Gitcoin funds to these matching funds. \n"},"metadataCid":"bafkreic3v73bebymbd6q6jywqo2ntcun3jz67mypn2wbyq4kjgd5les3bq","timestamp":"2024-10-23T17:08:24+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xf26afEFcb1FD04eade3de672Af487Aaf96d5f276","createdAtBlock":28406200}],"projectId":"0x5aed3b2ee44b10f025abfba88b48f7fb7f51a9e1fde5d9ba931a03d7a887470a","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"18","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-10-23T17:31:39.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"28406479"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-10-23T20:37:19.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"28408707"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":28440451,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-10-23T17:31:39+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x8aD670Cc6Cb51A8062e45bDC02352D1440d1a6f7","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":28409005,"createdByAddress":"0x00F16EC63017b2268Bc5513aBaf841B58095104c","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"16","metadata":{"signature":"0x219a87d9eee4aa2f957a44918a9b2c0bfe91235445e764c893ade62f268dfa1647e6985a86c05f027c00360c5f0d3250b852b0c34f446ffb8bbcabe958a96baa1b","application":{"round":"0x9a8df486d919d132253228b8bbcb1db419bc4d98","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"Hq8R/XEsMBMymeZCPPGOh1KdTqPRopUt/ZI1t5ieYb8xlr1tSxMEZmnZv1gyFK/x","encryptedSymmetricKey":"3c9b65d5aeef9a57902004cf6afc63740a5d2ce85ef5359d9a891a044c83b89064da2b9420c0bea1522d70115a182212bc92603f98b000c2569b561fa9aa4cea3656076a765840fb1cfefa1fd894ae4ec843f4ed3569bf747e0c4b108b0b1e8834c57b50b3aa21943abc4620d57963ec3f1f13642326578ab867a3729a1af17e000000000000002081dff5a80fc3dbc59c213e9decf21cf8abe84696f7d1e93a8cbc89ed90e92d95722433ff3b4c1acf01d5de93e51f51b7"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Past Gitcoin grants rounds (gg12 until present) and individual donation","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"3","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"52,000","hidden":false,"question":"Total Prior Funding","questionId":3},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"2008","hidden":false,"question":"Date Of Project Creation","questionId":4},{"type":"dropdown","answer":"Generally Familiar","hidden":false,"question":"Experience In Web3","questionId":5},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"0 - All funds raised go directly to indigenous activists and lawsuits, no operating costs","hidden":false,"question":"Annual Operating Budget","questionId":6}],"project":{"id":"0x905c32755d69e06338d7433c05ac660815b5b9a0eda869912afcbfc9bd7ba342","title":"Beyond Fossil Fuels - Supporting Indigenous legal efforts to STOP fossil fuel infrastructure","logoImg":"bafkreibs76jdejbm7u6gwtl4hcs2tzrbefmlqlg5oj2hgsotyeansua4a4","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreievepqt62wqd6apctzzgqedkyysk47ezrptvm6bkngkzkibgd3hs4","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://twitter.com/bff_campaign","bannerImg":"bafkreif6v3gqlgeqdvy77iroz5ql5ncdegyc6ibyhnis5rjo2pity7jvva","createdAt":1692246331541,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..XYMKy9lsMlvmVRVI6lGvAV1G1VTT1z2obDPkngHpEQ_oQ5BHhxM0dhOlGD-L-_j2tGsjafO3qEUR0S6HNv37Ag","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-13T22:10:09.163Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-13T22:10:09.163Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-12T22:10:09.163Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x00F16EC63017b2268Bc5513aBaf841B58095104c","hash":"v0.0.0:dmuSuy80V7siTXsjuflJFtA6I8E9lqGbdiKmLU7K/Zg=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#BFF_Campaign"}}},"description":"**Supporting Indigenous legal efforts to STOP fossil fuel infrastructure**\n  \nThis project was first established to support Indigenous activists working on the front lines of fights against the Trans Mountain Pipeline \"expansion\" project (TMX).

bioregional regeneration strategy, hosting convenings, and creating a Bioregional Financing Facility to enable systemic and regenerative investments in support of bioregional regeneration. We are a diverse network, co-led by an intertribal alliance, working together to strengthen connections and enable resource allocation across communities in our bioregion.\n\n[![temp-Image2wkp-Hc.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/kXSkDsFk/temp-Image2wkp-Hc.avif)](https://postimg.cc/56xPRwr3)\n\n**Our Bioregion, challenges, and opportunities**\n\nOur bioregion is characterized by diverse yet related Native peoples that have been unified through their relationships with their ancestral waterways, both riverine and maritime, evidenced by related Algonquin dialects being predominant throughout the region. These relationships have been purposefully fractured by colonization, which has an enduring impact through multiple layers of imposed bureaucracy, siloing of knowledge, and the proliferation of administrative mechanisms preventing the development of holistic regeneration strategies and Tribal self determination. The region has also been a major cradle of industrialization, and continues to have a strong manufacturing base despite an ongoing legacy of industrial decline. While we are possessed of immense financial and intellectual resources, we are also characterized by tremendous inequality in access to decision making spaces and wealth building opportunities. Taken together, these dynamics have resulted in interdependent challenges of ecosystem degradation, rapidly rising costs of often poor quality housing, a lack of self sufficiency in food production, regenerated but fragmented and ailing forests, depleted migratory, freshwater, and marine fisheries, an incomplete clean energy transition, strong car dependence, and extensive brownfields and ongoing industrial pollution. These challenges embody a fragmented dominant paradigm and culture.\n\nThese profound challenges are being faced by a multitude of regenerative actors and organizations, presenting as seeds and rooted place based initiatives. These include resurgent Tribal governance and knowledge initiatives, a regional organic food movement and cooperative culture, agroforestry and forestry initiatives, regional and local conservation initiatives, community Justice organizations, a coalescence of bio-based material organizations, and many others.\n\n[![Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-10-04-21-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vBWVcpT4/Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-10-04-21-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/34xRqfgh)\n*Source: One Earth*\n\n**Our Origins and Direction**\nOur team was born from the impetus to create coherence in the bioregional space of the northeast - weaving together existing bioregional and regenerative organizations in a new formation. Together, we have identified a foundational need to strengthen resurgent Indigenous governance to guide the development of a bioregional regeneration strategy and financing facility.\n\nOur current core organizing team includes representatives from the Mashantucket Pequot and Eastern Pequot Tribal Nations, the Alliance for the Mystic River Watershed, Bio-Based Materials Collective (BBMC), Center for an Ecology-Based Economy (CEBE), Connecticut River Valley Bioregioning Collaborative, Design School for Regenerating Earth, Northeast Healthy Soils Network (NEHSN), Sirius Ecovillage, and Wellspring Commons. We are also actively communicating with and recruiting other key bioregional actors, including through Roberta Hill’s (of CEBE) participation in the Wabanaki Alliance Tribal Coalition. This constellation has significant and deep expertise in social and ecological systems transformation.\n\nThis team is supported by network and blockchain finance experts from Bloom Network, Capital Institute, Co-creating Funding Ecosystems for Regeneration (CoFundEco), r3.0, Regen Network. Our members have conventional finance and investment banking experience, including managing DAFs, investment funds, and private placements; finance innovation experience, including DAO governance, community lending pools, federated cooperatives, retroactive public goods funding; and government grants.\nTo further expand our diverse networks, we are working diligently to expand leadership and peer organizing to fully include the movements we aim to support.\n\nCo-led by intertribal groups, we are bringing together diverse stakeholders to strengthen relationships and create regenerative pathways for people and the planet. Our core goal is to increase coherence among regional actors currently working in largely siloed ways to address the interdependence of our regional challenges through systemic interventions.\n\n**Our Guiding Principles:**\n1. Restore Right Earth Relations: Strengthening right relationships between communities, land, water, and our built environment.\n2. Earth Regeneration: Implementing regenerative practices to heal and sustain ecosystems and the communities stewarding them.\n3. Allyship (Relationality): Building respectful, reciprocal relationships with Tribal and regional communities across the bioregion and between bioregions.\n4. Aligning Resources around Aliveness: Aligning resources to invigorate communities and the natural world.\n    \n**Our Work To Date and at Present:**\nOver the last several months we have established relationships of trust across diverse existing networks, secured $25,000 in initial funding, and have agreed upon principles to guide our work and collaboration. We are working on developing a strategic vision including priority directions, alignment between our members, and securing commitments of time and resources to develop and implement our bioregional regeneration strategy. We share an intention for systemic transformation of capitalism, and feel our bioregion is truly ready to catalyze this, with the assistance of members in this organizing team who have decades of experience managing network finance across a wide array of traditional and innovative mechanisms, alongside deep facilitator and convener skill sets.\n\n[![Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-10-05-08-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4yshtBHB/Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-10-05-08-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/WFY3cmnk)\n*Funding Governance (r3.0) and CoFundEco*\n\n**Our Identified Needs for Holistic Bioregioning**\nWe are working toward a comprehensive strategy to regenerate our bioregion. In support of translating our work from our principles to actionable interventions, we have identified overarching needs in the following sectors. These take as a common root the need to protect and regenerate our ecological lifelines and respect the agency of Earth and more than human life for its own sake.\n\n* Ecosystem Health: Mapping and understanding our ecological lifelines in order to protect and regenerate our ecosystems and biodiversity for their own health and wellbeing; respecting the agency of Earth and more than human life for its own sake.\n* Water: Source water protection, accelerating dam and barrier removal, restoring floodplains and wetland complexes, scaling regenerative wastewater and stormwater systems, addressing watershed scale water quantity/flood management and quality improvements through decentralized and integrated approaches by working across other sectors below along with exploring sustainable monetization strategies for coastal and inland ecosystems.\n* Energy: Implementing genuinely regenerative energy solutions, focusing on demand reduction/elimination, community-owned renewables, and innovative applications like solar concentration, and integrated parking lot, building, and roadway systems. Supporting novel energy storage systems.\n* Manufacturing: Promoting bio-based and regenerative manufacturing platforms, developing the missing middle of value added food and biomaterial processing, building regional and local supply chains, and cooperative business models, and facilitating urban regeneration.\n* Food and Agriculture: Scaling organic and regenerative production, expanding agroforestry systems, reviving Indigenous agro-ecologies, and enhancing regional food production including regeneration of inland and marine fisheries. Foodways is also where financing a bioregion comes into direct contact with the ground, and facilitates building relationships and shared experiences.\n* Housing: Developing affordable, non-toxic bio-based housing and building technologies in support of rural and urban regeneration through education, policy work, workforce development, processing capacity and infrastructure, and building sustainable supply chains.\n* Transportation: Expanding active and public transit integrated with green infrastructure, scaling electric aviation and light rail, eliminating car dependency.\n* Health: Aligning environmental restoration with improved healthcare outcomes to reduce lifetime costs and foster well-being, expand self care and mindfulness practices at the individual, community, and enterprise level, explore a regenerative health insurance model coupled with quality of life bonds for states and municipalities.\n* Finance: Stewarding a phase shift in our ability to gather, store, and allocate financial capital in service to the regeneration of our bioregion, based on the idea that regenerative outcomes require a regenerative approach to funding governance. Creating fractal self determined and self sustaining financial mechanisms.\n\n**What's Next and What Must Be Overcome:**\nOur coherence and movement building must address that challenge that we are modeling a more collaborative and decentralized approach to bioregional finance, against a backdrop of pre-existing regional networks in the Northeast. This takes more time and is more complicated, though it offers tremendous value to the bioregional networks movement as we become able to share examples. Acknowledgment of this fact by the bioregional funding networks in terms of time pressure and support for the additional layer of coordination overhead, will ensure our success in what we have to share, and help us build regenerative experiences together as we do this path-forging work.\n\nWe will continue to build relationships internally and across our bioregion in support of developing a cohesive bioregional regeneration strategy. We envision a truly just transition to a thriving, regenerative future for all inhabitants, reweaving the tapestry of the lands and waterways of Northeast.\n\nThe funds raised from this grant will support organizing and strategic planning, toward the following next steps:\n* Form a clear vision and mission statement for focused, coherent coordination.\n* Establish governance structures in partnership with regional intertribal alliances, providing a framework for coordinating bioregional regeneration efforts.\n* Organization forms we’ve discussed to date included federated cooperatives and a Bioregional Trust.\n* Map out existing and emergent initiatives within the bioregion.\n* Host in-person and digital gatherings with partners to refine strategies, governance structures, and funding models for coordinating bioregional regeneration efforts.\n* We will gradually increase in convening scale and/or diversify to specific working groups as coherence forms.\n* Deepen co-presencing and co-learning building on our current practices of engaging within our team, other regions and beyond human kin to further expand our collective capacity\n* Identify and pursue further resources to support organizing and partner work to promote ecosystem health and community resilience\n* Develop a network of bioregional learning centers/hubs to help communities deepen their connection to place, cultivate coherence and a shared understanding of bioregional engagement, and co-create knowledge commons.\n\nAs we form our Bioregional Financing Facility, we are drawing upon the deep experience and wealth of this bioregion, to craft truly regenerative circular bioeconomies and the cultural and governance structures to achieve systemic transformation of capitalism.\n\n**Regen Foundation is serving as a Fiscal Sponsor for this project, hence the regenfoundation.eth address.*\n","lastUpdated":0},"recipient":"0xd68e5b216FC2AF2854152EAC501F9E00807d8C1d"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreihslf4muga2kddjxu4odiy4ufceifprfb2breranx3gohtbsyuh2u","projects":[{"name":"Forests of the Northeast","id":"0x72abd52915c78829584357fec0764af007852770285aab1c1bbac0775c37a1e0","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Forests of the Northeast","logoImg":"bafkreiaagp4nwmqpudr5bi6ruru2o3wsva72qlskz24uhk7vcaforfckfy","website":"https://www.wellspringcommons.org","bannerImg":"bafkreieipn6hmx2gniud6yx2zppiiblyvfiqdlokuasezqmorrneglqylq","createdAt":1729655496972,"userGithub":"willszal","credentials":{},"description":"**Our Initiative in a Nutshell: Bioregional Organizing Team for a Northeast Bioregional Financing Facility**\n\nThe Northeast Bioregional Organizing Team is a collaborative effort working toward bioregional regeneration of the Northeastern “United States.” Our principle proposed activities include co-developing a regional intertribal alliance for the regeneration of ancestral watersheds, drafting a bioregional regeneration strategy, hosting convenings, and creating a Bioregional Financing Facility to enable systemic and regenerative investments in support of bioregional regeneration.

Proposal for Implementing Bioregional Finance in Northern Uganda\n\n## Introduction\n\nBioregional finance is a financial model that supports sustainable development initiatives tailored to the unique ecological and cultural contexts of a specific region. Northern Uganda, with its diverse ecosystems and community needs, can significantly benefit from such an integrative financial approach. This proposal outlines the basic background, challenges, vision, objectives, key processes, expected opportunities, strategies, outcomes, and next steps for this work in the region.\n\n## About Northern Uganda\n\nNorthern Uganda is typically defined by specific geographic and ecological characteristics, encompassing the following districts:\n\n- Regions: Primarily the Acholi, Lango, West Nile, and parts of the Karamoja region.\n    \n- Key Districts: Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Lira, Apac, Nebbi, and Arua, among others.\n    \n\n## Ecological Features\n\n1. Ecosystems - Savannah and Grasslands: Dominant in many areas, supporting diverse wildlife and pastoral practices, numerous wetlands provide critical habitats for biodiversity and serve as natural water filtration systems, mixed forests and woodland areas are vital for biodiversity and local livelihoods.\n    \n2. Climate: Characterized by a tropical savanna climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons, influencing agricultural practices and water availability.\n    \n\n## Cultural and Socioeconomic Aspects\n\n1. Communities: Home to various ethnic groups, including the Acholi, Langi, and Alur, each with unique cultural practices, languages, and traditional knowledge.\n    \n2. Economic Activities: Agriculture is the mainstay, with crops like millet, cassava, and maize. Livestock rearing is also significant.\n    \n3. Historical Context: The region has experienced conflict, notably during the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, impacting social structures and economic development.\n    \n\n## Challenges \n\nEconomic Disparities: High levels of poverty and unemployment. Northern Uganda has faced decades of conflicts, particularly due to the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, which led to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of infrastructure. This has had lasting impacts on economic development and social cohesion.\n\nEnvironmental Degradation: Deforestation, soil erosion, and water scarcity in Northern Uganda presents significant challenges that affect both the ecosystem and the livelihoods of local communities. Here are some key issues:\n\n1. Deforestation: The expansion of agricultural land, logging for timber, and charcoal production have led to extensive deforestation. This reduces biodiversity and contributes to soil erosion.\n\n2. Soil Degradation: Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as monocropping and overgrazing, lead to soil erosion and nutrient depletion.\n\n3.  Water Pollution: Poor waste management practices, industrial discharges, and agricultural runoff contribute to water contamination.\n\n4.  Climate Change: Northern Uganda is experiencing changing weather patterns, leading to unpredictable rainfall and prolonged dry spells. This exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in agriculture and water availability.\n\n5.

Théra, we're committed to transforming our bioregion through regenerative practices, rooted in joy and a belief in making the impossible possible: We are learning to be comfortable in the unknown, taking step after step as it becomes apparent, toward creating a sustainable future for both the land and its people. Our approach combines ecological restoration, economic revitalization, and community engagement, all while honoring the rich cultural heritage of our area.\n________________________________________\n\nProposal:\nOur Bioregional Learning Center lives in the Tarn-et-Garonne region of southwest France, about an hour and a quarter north of Toulouse. This area, though rich in natural beauty and cultural history, faces significant challenges like soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and economic decline. Despite being one of France's leading regions in organic farming, it remains economically disadvantaged.\n\nUnderstanding Our Bioregion:\nWe've defined our bioregion not just by physical boundaries but by the interconnected systems of nature and community that span beyond the Tarn-et-Garonne. This includes the broader southwest of France, bordered by the Pyrenees, the Massif Central, and the Atlantic Ocean. Our collaborative mapping efforts with local farmers, scientists, community leaders, and residents have helped us identify both the challenges we face and the opportunities ahead.\n\nThéra's Role and Evolution:\nThéra started as a group of dedicated individuals—farmers, ecologists, builders, educators—who shared a common goal of regenerating our land and community. We've recently formalized our organization as a non-profit and are working within a network of both for-profit and non-profit partners. Our aim is to amplify individual efforts through collective action.\nOur mission is to promote regenerative practices and build resilience against today's global challenges. We support projects in areas like biodiversity, sustainable housing, culture, new economic models, health, and education. Our center serves as a hub where project leaders can collaborate, share knowledge, and access resources. It's also a place where the public can learn about and engage with regenerative practices.\n\nCurrent Initiatives:\n1.\tWaterway Restoration:\nWe're collaborating with local river authorities and community groups to restore waterways using natural, low-tech methods like creating beaver dams. This helps improve water management, boost biodiversity, and strengthen community ties.\n2.\tAffordable Eco-Housing:\nIn partnership with local municipalities, we're working to build affordable, eco-friendly homes in and around villages. This initiative aims to attract new residents—like digital nomads and young farmers—by offering modern comforts in a rural setting. We're also providing training in regenerative farming to support sustainable livelihoods.\n3.\tThéra Bébinet Buildathon:\nWe're organizing a one-time event next year called the Buildathon. We'll bring together architects, builders, permaculture experts, volunteers, and local residents to construct all the necessary facilities for our center in a focused effort. This includes sustainable homes, community spaces, and regenerative agricultural systems. The Buildathon is more than a construction project; it's a demonstration of what's possible through collaboration.\n\nOur Land and Vision:\nOur center is situated on 5.2 hectares of land that has been unused for over 40 years. It includes:\n•\tA main house that we plan to use as both a workspace and a community gathering place.\n•\tPlans for a market garden, food forest, medicinal garden, and natural swimming pool, all designed using permaculture principles.\n•\tA small ruin along a public walking path that we're renovating to strengthen our connection with the local community.\n•\tA buildable area where we'll construct eco-houses and cabins for eco-tourism, providing unique experiences and generating income to support our projects.\nWe aim to be as self-sufficient as possible in terms of food, energy, and water. Our land will serve as both a practical example of sustainable living and a sanctuary for peace and wellness. We also intend to host workshops, events, and performances to engage and inspire others.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Cultural Heritage:\nWe value the knowledge and traditions of local elders and communities. By engaging with those who have a deep connection to the land, we ensure our efforts are respectful and culturally sensitive. This helps us integrate ancestral practices into our work and strengthen community bonds.\n\nFinancial Strategies and Building BioFi Capacity:\nWe've combined public grants, private donations, and our own efforts to fund our initiatives so far. However, we recognize that funding for regenerative projects is often fragmented and insufficient. To address this, we're developing elegant.capital, a financing platform designed to streamline funding for regenerative projects by:\n•\tCombining various sources like loans, investments, grants, crowdfunding, and donations.\n•\tSimplifying access to funds to accelerate project timelines.\n•\tEncouraging broader participation in regional regeneration efforts.\nWe've learned that aligning financial mechanisms with our ecological and social values is crucial, though it comes with challenges like navigating regulations and ensuring fair access to funds.\n\nChallenges and Key Questions:\nAs we move forward, we're considering:\n•\tHow can we design financial mechanisms that are both effective and just?\n•\tWhat governance structures best support collective decision-making and resource distribution?\n•\tHow do we scale our initiatives without compromising our core values?\n\nUse of Gitcoin Funds:\nSupport from Gitcoin would help us:\n•\tHost Community Events: These events will help refine our strategies, build networks, and foster collaboration.\n•\tDevelop Infrastructure for Elegant.Capital: We'll address legal requirements and build technical systems for transparency and efficiency.\n•\tEnhance Communication: Creating engaging materials will help us share our vision and attract more support.\n•\tFacilitate Workshops: Training community members in governance and resource management will empower more people to participate actively.\n\nConclusion:\nAt Théra, we're driven by a genuine belief in what's possible when people come together with a shared purpose. We embrace uncertainty as a space for innovation, taking deliberate steps to transform challenges into opportunities. Our work is about nurturing a movement that values the land, honors our heritage, and builds a sustainable future.\nBy supporting us, you're contributing to a collective effort to regenerate our region in meaningful ways. We invite you to join us in turning possibility into reality.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We're grateful for the opportunity to share our vision with you.\n","lastUpdated":0},"recipient":"0x3eD82c11Ba0e5C753136e7d0b3a08F72D2C679fF"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiheb6qqxdf4ulxnjoarzohfnofgwqkswnbs6siu2j5h23wrg7zbny","projects":[{"name":"Théra - Bioregional regeneration in the southwest of France","id":"0x1aa49754037cb9c021ba9b54598d7c13da0223b2fc9397380bd17fe2801d01dd","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Théra - Bioregional regeneration in the southwest of France","logoImg":"bafkreihqizcncjdanzskiif7vzhu4o34s7gvptgq67ejsb6yh6ceyteagq","website":"https://thera.earth","bannerImg":"bafkreifpkh4jbhnaaw43ryirdc6zdz7jv22ql7y3ysiptt6pyvgzcyxhee","createdAt":1729610917004,"credentials":{},"description":"Summary:\nAt Théra, we're committed to transforming our bioregion through regenerative practices, rooted in joy and a belief in making the impossible possible: We are learning to be comfortable in the unknown, taking step after step as it becomes apparent, toward creating a sustainable future for both the land and its people.

Over the past four years, we have fostered relationships, developed recognition structures, and created pathways for individuals to engage in **land & water stewardship**, **resource management**, and **skills development** in the Southern Pacific Zone of Costa Rica.\n\n## A Unique Bioregion: Rural, Resilient, and Ready for Regeneration\n\nCosta Rica’s **Southern Pacific Zone**, from **mountain to sea**, is a rich ecosystem that has remained largely agricultural and conservation-focused to respect and protect it's globally recognized biodiversity. This region attracts people passionate about **permaculture** and **land restoration**, working alongside local communities to support **preservation efforts**. Our work centers around building a **resilient economy** through **shared governance** and **resource-sharing**, guided by the **Boruca Indigenous community** and global regenerative practitioners.\n\n[Learn more about our Bioregion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328705001394)  \n\n## A Collaborative Network of Stewards and Innovators\n\nOur team includes **land stewards**, **community organizers**, and **global regenerative experts** working together to implement models that blend **traditional knowledge** with **decentralized finance (ReFi)**. We’ve developed the **Eight Stages of Stewardship**, providing pathways for people to progress from **visitors to land trustees**. Events like the **Seed Festival**, **[Protopian Convergence](https://www.protopianconvergence.org/nextevent)** and **[Bliss Burn](http://blissburn.org/)** connect global regenerative leaders with local communities to drive forward our vision.\n\n## Bioregional Financing: A Model for Global Impact\n\nAs we scale our work, we’re building a **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** to fund **land restoration**, **cultural exchange**, and **ecological projects**. This facility ensures resources flow directly to grassroots leaders regenerating our bioregion, with a focus on **transparency** and **community-led governance**.\n\n\n## Honoring Indigenous Wisdom and Preserving Cultural Heritage\n\nThe **Boruca Indigenous people** play a crucial role in shaping our bioregional strategy. Their deep ecological knowledge guides our efforts to regenerate the land and protect **sacred sites**.

Over the past four years, we have fostered relationships, developed recognition structures, and created pathways for individuals to engage in **land & water stewardship**, **resource management**, and **skills development** in the Southern Pacific Zone of Costa Rica.\n\n## A Unique Bioregion: Rural, Resilient, and Ready for Regeneration\n\nCosta Rica’s **Southern Pacific Zone**, from **mountain to sea**, is a rich ecosystem that has remained largely agricultural and conservation-focused to respect and protect it's globally recognized biodiversity. This region attracts people passionate about **permaculture** and **land restoration**, working alongside local communities to support **preservation efforts**. Our work centers around building a **resilient economy** through **shared governance** and **resource-sharing**, guided by the **Boruca Indigenous community** and global regenerative practitioners.\n\n[Learn more about our Bioregion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328705001394)  \n\n## A Collaborative Network of Stewards and Innovators\n\nOur team includes **land stewards**, **community organizers**, and **global regenerative experts** working together to implement models that blend **traditional knowledge** with **decentralized finance (ReFi)**. We’ve developed the **Eight Stages of Stewardship**, providing pathways for people to progress from **visitors to land trustees**. Events like the **Seed Festival**, **[Protopian Convergence](https://www.protopianconvergence.org/nextevent)** and **[Bliss Burn](http://blissburn.org/)** connect global regenerative leaders with local communities to drive forward our vision.\n\n## Bioregional Financing: A Model for Global Impact\n\nAs we scale our work, we’re building a **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** to fund **land restoration**, **cultural exchange**, and **ecological projects**. This facility ensures resources flow directly to grassroots leaders regenerating our bioregion, with a focus on **transparency** and **community-led governance**.\n\n\n## Honoring Indigenous Wisdom and Preserving Cultural Heritage\n\nThe **Boruca Indigenous people** play a crucial role in shaping our bioregional strategy. Their deep ecological knowledge guides our efforts to regenerate the land and protect **sacred sites**.

THE BIOREGION\n\nThe Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, containing 2.5% of the world’s biodiversity and inspiring National Geographic magazine to call it “the most biologically intense place on Earth.” The peninsula features one of the longest remaining undeveloped primary rainforests and largest mangrove wetlands on the pacific coast in Central America. The Golfo Dulce Bay is one of four tropical fjords in the world and the calving grounds of both the southern hemisphere and northern pacific humpback whales. Within its rich rainforest and coastal zones, Costa Rican culture, indigenous populations, and archeological sites reside. \n\nHistorically, the Osa Peninsula has been one of the most remote and less traveled places of Costa Rica, which has protected its abundant wildlife and culture. This is changing. In the past five years there has been increased interest in the peninsula for mass development and tourism projects, which threatens the rich biodiversity and culture that sets it apart from other regions of Costa Rica.  Without proper institutional infrastructure and planning in place, these activities could lead to significant damage to the Osa's ecosystem and local culture. \n\nIn addition to this, 35% of the local population lives in severe poverty, which in turn threatens the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as people resort to any possible means to make a living, often at the expense of the ecological wealth.  Without regenerative alternatives, people have turned to destructive practices such as deforestation, poaching, mining, unsustainable agriculture, prostitution, and other illegal activities, and often end up selling their land to developers, leaving irreversible effects on the ecosystem and communities.\n\nOver the past eight years, alongside this looming threat of unsustainable development, a powerful local movement to design a regenerative economy that protects and enhances the environment, creates health and wellbeing for communities and strengthens the cultural identity of the people has emerged in the Osa Peninsula. A major reflection of this was the collaborative creation and use of the “Regenerative Osa Systems Map”, led by a diverse group of local leaders and a US based NGO, Regenerative Earth, in 2015. Following this was the creation of the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula (CEDPO), a partnership between the Institute of Rural Development (INDER), The Osa Territory Council (CTDR), and Regenerative Earth.\n\nTHE BIOREGIONAL PROJECT HISTORY \n\nA major asset for the Osa Peninsula is that it has a government agency, INDER (Institute of Rural Development) whose sole purpose is to assist with regional development projects. However, the capital resources of INDER are not being fully utilized as many critical projects that address poverty, conservation, and sustainable livelihoods are deemed too high risk and lacking in the appropriate technical and social capacity to receive funding. This has rendered this valuable, accessible, local source of financing as underutilized. This is also the case with Costa Rican and International Foundations and investment groups who seek to fund regenerative projects in the Osa Peninsula. Without proper support to strengthen the existing technical and social capacity, regional leaders and their potential projects may not be able to generate the critical momentum and financial backing needed to succeed in this ambitious journey.\n\nIn addition to this, another major asset for the Osa Peninsula is the Osa Territorial Council, a council made up of 60% civic representation and 40% government representation with an elected representative from every community, indigenous territory, and local government agency within the Osa Territory. This governance body is responsible for creating the Osa Territorial Development Plan and selecting the projects that INDER funds. Many of these projects are the ones that INDER is not able to fund due to a lack of capacity. Through a cohesive governance body representing the diverse voices of the Osa Peninsula, the Osa Territorial Council carries the collective vision and action plan for the future of the Peninsula, providing national and international funders in the region a pathway to collaborate around a locally driven vision and plan. \n\nDue to the above mentioned INDER, in 2020, requested that the Regenerative Earth team co-design and implement a capacity strengthening program, the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula, to strengthen the governance body of the Osa Territorial Council, develop a systems-based criteria for project selection, and develop and de-risk projects to greatly increase the quantity and quality of projects INDER and other investors can fund, to promote sustainable livelihoods based on the protection of biodiversity and preservation of local culture for this globally-significant region. \n\nThe approach recognizes that for a project (business, non-profit, organization, strategic network, or coalition) to merit funding, the teams and organizations behind them must have the capacity to assemble effective, logical, and feasible plans, and to provide confidence to funders that they can execute these plans. In the Osa Peninsula the limiting factor for projects to access funding, and for investors to find fundable projects, is this capacity. CEDPO integrates these local capacity-strengthening needs with national and international financing requirements to catalyze and strengthen a regenerative economy that is locally driven for this remarkable region.\n\nIn the spring of 2022 the Osa Territorial Council (CTDR), Institute of Rural Development (INDER), and Regenerative Earth launched CEDPO with six main objectives: \n\n1. To strengthen the capacity of the Osa Territorial Council and its ability to be an effective governance body and voice for the people of the Osa Peninsula. \n\n2. Strengthen the capacities of locally-led projects, businesses, and alliances in the Osa Peninsula that are selected through a systems-based criteria and promote a thriving rainforest and marine ecosystem, culture, community, and regenerative economy.\n\n3. Connect projects with a broad network of universities, government Institutions, market channels, investors, and experts relevant to project needs. \n\n4. Bridge gaps between projects seeking funds and funds seeking projects\n\n5. Design a financially-sustainable, self-sufficient and regenerative funding model for the projects and program.\n\n6. Monitor, evaluate, and learn from the program's effectiveness to inform future iterations in the Osa and in other locations globally.\n\nTHE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF THE OSA PENINSULA- El Centro Estratégico de Desarrollo de la Península de Osa (CEDPO)\n\nCEDPO is currently a partnership agreement between INDER, The Osa Territorial Council, and Regenerative Earth (a US based 501c3) with the vision to establish in the near future a Costa Rican Foundation for CEDPO. The CEDPO board of directors voting members consists of the President of the Osa Territorial Council, the Executive Director of Regenerative Earth, and the Regional Director of INDER. CEDPO has a full time paid program coordinator who is from the region, manages the program on the ground, and reports to the CEDPO board. The board of directors must have consensus in any decisions or actions taken. This allows the whole of the Osa Territorial Council and its diverse set of local and indigenous voices to be an active participant in CEDPO and to approve any actions that CEDPO takes. \n\nOver the past three years CEDPO has strengthened the capacity of over two dozen projects that were selected by local leaders with a systems criteria and supported the Osa Territorial Council in creating its new six year territorial development plan in a way that incorporated the local citizens’ vision and needs. CEDPO also connected regional and national institutions, universities, NGOs, and resources to its selected projects and initiatives and through Regenerative Earth directly granted over $169,000 to these projects.\n\nTHE PROJECTS CEDPO HAS FUNDED \n\nBelow is a list of the projects CEDPO has funded through regrants. CEDPO also works with many other projects through capacity strengthening and connecting resources to those projects. \n\nStrengthening Cultural Systems, with families from the Ngäbe Community, from the Alto Laguna territory - Total Grant Awarded: $9,000 in 2023 and $90,000 2025 - The Ngöbe tribe lives in a territory at the heart of the Osa Peninsula and they struggle to maintain their cultural heritage. The Ngöbe’s vision is to become food sovereign, to generate revenue through agricultural production with native seeds, develop eco and cultural tourism within their territory, strengthen an indigenous woman’s artisanal cooperative, and create a school to pass on the ancestral wisdom from the elders to the youth. \n\nRaising Coral - Total Grant awarded: $16,000 - Raising Coral is a local organization that is researching and restoring the native coral reefs in the Golfo Dulce Bay. We supported their coral gardener training for local youth to be certified divers and to grow the coral in the Bay. \n\nPueblos Unidos Turismo Arqueológico - Total Grant Awarded: $15,330 - Revaluing the intangible cultural, environmental and archaeological heritage of El Progreso, Drake Bay and providing alternatives for local livelihoods to enhance the quality of life for the people and environment in the area.\n\nAromas De Osa - Grant awarded: $15,000 - Aromas de Osa LLC is a venture that aims to promote the cultivation and distribution of natural vanilla. They are training farmers in the Osa Peninsula to grow and cultivate high quality natural vanilla in agroforestry systems and have secured an MOU with a company based in the Netherlands to market the vanilla produced and invest in a vanilla production facility in the Osa Peninsula. \n\nAssociation of Artisans Collectors and Recyclers of the Osa Peninsula (ASAOSA) - Total Grants Awarded: $23,000 - Serving as the only recycling program in the Osa Peninsula. It is locally led, women driven, and incredibly under-resourced. CEDPO is supporting ASAOSA in complying with health and safety regulations, improving infrastructure and processing efficiency, educational outreach to the community, and strengthening business and financial planning.\n\nFUTURE VISION\n\nThe CEDPO partners believe in the opportunity for the Osa Peninsula to be a model for the planet demonstrating world class conservation alongside sustainable livelihoods where humans and nature synergistically thrive together. With the increasing threat of climate change, these exemplar regions are needed now more than ever to inspire a new economy and way of living on the Earth. \n\nOver the next three years CEDPO hopes to achieve six main objectives: \n\n1. Establish a Costa Rican foundation for CEDPO run by the preexisting board of directors with potential new directors onboarded. We hope to have at least two full time employees - one social capacity strengthener and one technical capacity strengthener. We also hope that this can become a community led financing facility that generates permanent financing for capacity strengthening and project investments in the Osa Peninsula.\n\n2. Continued updating of the Regenerative Osa Systems Map to serve as a guide for project selection and territorial planning. \n\n3.

The Golfo Dulce Bay is one of four tropical fjords in the world and the calving grounds of both the southern hemisphere and northern pacific humpback whales. Within its rich rainforest and coastal zones, Costa Rican culture, indigenous populations, and archeological sites reside. \n\nHistorically, the Osa Peninsula has been one of the most remote and less traveled places of Costa Rica, which has protected its abundant wildlife and culture. This is changing. In the past five years there has been increased interest in the peninsula for mass development and tourism projects, which threatens the rich biodiversity and culture that sets it apart from other regions of Costa Rica.  Without proper institutional infrastructure and planning in place, these activities could lead to significant damage to the Osa's ecosystem and local culture. \n\nIn addition to this, 35% of the local population lives in severe poverty, which in turn threatens the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as people resort to any possible means to make a living, often at the expense of the ecological wealth.  Without regenerative alternatives, people have turned to destructive practices such as deforestation, poaching, mining, unsustainable agriculture, prostitution, and other illegal activities, and often end up selling their land to developers, leaving irreversible effects on the ecosystem and communities.\n\nOver the past eight years, alongside this looming threat of unsustainable development, a powerful local movement to design a regenerative economy that protects and enhances the environment, creates health and wellbeing for communities and strengthens the cultural identity of the people has emerged in the Osa Peninsula. A major reflection of this was the collaborative creation and use of the “Regenerative Osa Systems Map”, led by a diverse group of local leaders and a US based NGO, Regenerative Earth, in 2015. Following this was the creation of the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula (CEDPO), a partnership between the Institute of Rural Development (INDER), The Osa Territory Council (CTDR), and Regenerative Earth.\n\nTHE BIOREGIONAL PROJECT HISTORY \n\nA major asset for the Osa Peninsula is that it has a government agency, INDER (Institute of Rural Development) whose sole purpose is to assist with regional development projects. However, the capital resources of INDER are not being fully utilized as many critical projects that address poverty, conservation, and sustainable livelihoods are deemed too high risk and lacking in the appropriate technical and social capacity to receive funding. This has rendered this valuable, accessible, local source of financing as underutilized. This is also the case with Costa Rican and International Foundations and investment groups who seek to fund regenerative projects in the Osa Peninsula. Without proper support to strengthen the existing technical and social capacity, regional leaders and their potential projects may not be able to generate the critical momentum and financial backing needed to succeed in this ambitious journey.\n\nIn addition to this, another major asset for the Osa Peninsula is the Osa Territorial Council, a council made up of 60% civic representation and 40% government representation with an elected representative from every community, indigenous territory, and local government agency within the Osa Territory. This governance body is responsible for creating the Osa Territorial Development Plan and selecting the projects that INDER funds. Many of these projects are the ones that INDER is not able to fund due to a lack of capacity. Through a cohesive governance body representing the diverse voices of the Osa Peninsula, the Osa Territorial Council carries the collective vision and action plan for the future of the Peninsula, providing national and international funders in the region a pathway to collaborate around a locally driven vision and plan. \n\nDue to the above mentioned INDER, in 2020, requested that the Regenerative Earth team co-design and implement a capacity strengthening program, the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula, to strengthen the governance body of the Osa Territorial Council, develop a systems-based criteria for project selection, and develop and de-risk projects to greatly increase the quantity and quality of projects INDER and other investors can fund, to promote sustainable livelihoods based on the protection of biodiversity and preservation of local culture for this globally-significant region. \n\nThe approach recognizes that for a project (business, non-profit, organization, strategic network, or coalition) to merit funding, the teams and organizations behind them must have the capacity to assemble effective, logical, and feasible plans, and to provide confidence to funders that they can execute these plans. In the Osa Peninsula the limiting factor for projects to access funding, and for investors to find fundable projects, is this capacity. CEDPO integrates these local capacity-strengthening needs with national and international financing requirements to catalyze and strengthen a regenerative economy that is locally driven for this remarkable region.\n\nIn the spring of 2022 the Osa Territorial Council (CTDR), Institute of Rural Development (INDER), and Regenerative Earth launched CEDPO with six main objectives: \n\n1. To strengthen the capacity of the Osa Territorial Council and its ability to be an effective governance body and voice for the people of the Osa Peninsula. \n\n2. Strengthen the capacities of locally-led projects, businesses, and alliances in the Osa Peninsula that are selected through a systems-based criteria and promote a thriving rainforest and marine ecosystem, culture, community, and regenerative economy.\n\n3. Connect projects with a broad network of universities, government Institutions, market channels, investors, and experts relevant to project needs. \n\n4. Bridge gaps between projects seeking funds and funds seeking projects\n\n5. Design a financially-sustainable, self-sufficient and regenerative funding model for the projects and program.\n\n6. Monitor, evaluate, and learn from the program's effectiveness to inform future iterations in the Osa and in other locations globally.\n\nTHE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF THE OSA PENINSULA- El Centro Estratégico de Desarrollo de la Península de Osa (CEDPO)\n\nCEDPO is currently a partnership agreement between INDER, The Osa Territorial Council, and Regenerative Earth (a US based 501c3) with the vision to establish in the near future a Costa Rican Foundation for CEDPO. The CEDPO board of directors voting members consists of the President of the Osa Territorial Council, the Executive Director of Regenerative Earth, and the Regional Director of INDER. CEDPO has a full time paid program coordinator who is from the region, manages the program on the ground, and reports to the CEDPO board. The board of directors must have consensus in any decisions or actions taken. This allows the whole of the Osa Territorial Council and its diverse set of local and indigenous voices to be an active participant in CEDPO and to approve any actions that CEDPO takes. \n\nOver the past three years CEDPO has strengthened the capacity of over two dozen projects that were selected by local leaders with a systems criteria and supported the Osa Territorial Council in creating its new six year territorial development plan in a way that incorporated the local citizens’ vision and needs. CEDPO also connected regional and national institutions, universities, NGOs, and resources to its selected projects and initiatives and through Regenerative Earth directly granted over $169,000 to these projects.\n\nTHE PROJECTS CEDPO HAS FUNDED \n\nBelow is a list of the projects CEDPO has funded through regrants. CEDPO also works with many other projects through capacity strengthening and connecting resources to those projects. \n\nStrengthening Cultural Systems, with families from the Ngäbe Community, from the Alto Laguna territory - Total Grant Awarded: $9,000 in 2023 and $90,000 2025 - The Ngöbe tribe lives in a territory at the heart of the Osa Peninsula and they struggle to maintain their cultural heritage. The Ngöbe’s vision is to become food sovereign, to generate revenue through agricultural production with native seeds, develop eco and cultural tourism within their territory, strengthen an indigenous woman’s artisanal cooperative, and create a school to pass on the ancestral wisdom from the elders to the youth. \n\nRaising Coral - Total Grant awarded: $16,000 - Raising Coral is a local organization that is researching and restoring the native coral reefs in the Golfo Dulce Bay. We supported their coral gardener training for local youth to be certified divers and to grow the coral in the Bay. \n\nPueblos Unidos Turismo Arqueológico - Total Grant Awarded: $15,330 - Revaluing the intangible cultural, environmental and archaeological heritage of El Progreso, Drake Bay and providing alternatives for local livelihoods to enhance the quality of life for the people and environment in the area.\n\nAromas De Osa - Grant awarded: $15,000 - Aromas de Osa LLC is a venture that aims to promote the cultivation and distribution of natural vanilla. They are training farmers in the Osa Peninsula to grow and cultivate high quality natural vanilla in agroforestry systems and have secured an MOU with a company based in the Netherlands to market the vanilla produced and invest in a vanilla production facility in the Osa Peninsula. \n\nAssociation of Artisans Collectors and Recyclers of the Osa Peninsula (ASAOSA) - Total Grants Awarded: $23,000 - Serving as the only recycling program in the Osa Peninsula. It is locally led, women driven, and incredibly under-resourced. CEDPO is supporting ASAOSA in complying with health and safety regulations, improving infrastructure and processing efficiency, educational outreach to the community, and strengthening business and financial planning.\n\nFUTURE VISION\n\nThe CEDPO partners believe in the opportunity for the Osa Peninsula to be a model for the planet demonstrating world class conservation alongside sustainable livelihoods where humans and nature synergistically thrive together. With the increasing threat of climate change, these exemplar regions are needed now more than ever to inspire a new economy and way of living on the Earth. \n\nOver the next three years CEDPO hopes to achieve six main objectives: \n\n1. Establish a Costa Rican foundation for CEDPO run by the preexisting board of directors with potential new directors onboarded. We hope to have at least two full time employees - one social capacity strengthener and one technical capacity strengthener. We also hope that this can become a community led financing facility that generates permanent financing for capacity strengthening and project investments in the Osa Peninsula.\n\n2. Continued updating of the Regenerative Osa Systems Map to serve as a guide for project selection and territorial planning. \n\n3. Strengthened governance body of the Osa Territorial Council to be able to effectively incorporate the diversity of citizen voices in the Osa Peninsula. \n\n4. Strengthened capacity of projects selected through a systems criteria by the Osa Territorial Council \n\n5. Continued grant making and investing in priority projects \n\n6. Strengthened networks between projects and preexisting funders and capacity strengthening organizations. \n\nWe’d like to use the Gitcoin funds to support the operational capacity of CEDPO and to pay for attorney fees for the creation of a Costa Rican CEDPO Foundation, so that all of our funds are being managed locally and transparently. We think this will greatly increase CEDPO’s capacity to receive funding from a broader set of donors, to hire employees, and to develop a locally led organization.

Particularly through participatory activities and capacity-building. We invite these groups to consider:**\n>*What does a regenerative future for our bioregion look like? If people were resourced to make this happen, how can this have the most impact and connect regenerators on the ground with funders and the technology we need, as best determined by the people doing the work? How do we build the buy-in and consent of our communities? And lastly, how do we use this “moment” to lead to a regenerative future rather than see it fizzle away?*\n\nThe mission of Regenerate Cascadia is to regenerate the Cascadia bioregion and create the conditions for a regenerative culture to thrive. As part of this, we educate about bioregionalism, grow the shared context of our place, and give direct funding for the core capacity of teams and projects. We provide much-needed administrative scaffolding as groups are beginning so they can receive and leverage decentralized flow funding and spin out new bioregional initiatives as part of a shared, coherent, multi-generational regeneration strategy.\n\nThis first funding round will assist our watershed working groups in locations throughout Cascadia and help us experiment with new forms of shared governance and participatory budgeting processes at the landscape level.\n\n# Now, we need your help to connect on-the-ground regenerative organizers, projects, and communities with the power and tools of Web3. \n\n![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/667c5f66bb46f07b901872e9_what-is-bff-3-layer-image-2-1024x775.png)\n*Figure 2: What is a BFF from the BioFi website - https://biofi.earth*\n\nWeb3 can help break down and move past arbitrary boundaries, map what is important to our communities, identify what needs to be protected, and connect portfolios of projects in the context of an entire landscape in ways we can directly fund and de-risk. We need to create tools for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) built through community consent and data sovereignty that help tell the stories of stewardship in ways that catalyze financial flows. \n\n**We deeply believe in the founding beliefs of these tools, as outlined by Celo:** \n>Web3 represents an internet where users have more control over their data, identity, and digital assets. This means no central authority controls the network, allowing for more transparency, security, and ownership. Web3 empowers individuals by giving them full control over their digital assets (like cryptocurrencies and NFTs) and how they interact with online services, making it a key shift towards a more open, user-owned internet.

It has an economy generating more than 1.613147 trillion worth of goods and services annually, making it the world's ninth-largest economy and roughly equivalent to that of Canada or Italy. Its population would be similar in size to Ecuador, Zambia, Cambodia, or the Netherlands. Cascadia contains the largest tracts of untouched old-growth temperate rainforests in the world, including 7 of the top 10 world carbon-absorbing forests, the world's tallest trees, thousands of volcanoes, hot springs, rivers, lakes, inlets, islands, and ocean, and some of the last diminishing, though still impressive wild habitats of salmon, wolves, bear, whale, orca.

Particularly through participatory activities and capacity-building. We invite these groups to consider:**\n>*What does a regenerative future for our bioregion look like? If people were resourced to make this happen, how can this have the most impact and connect regenerators on the ground with funders and the technology we need, as best determined by the people doing the work? How do we build the buy-in and consent of our communities? And lastly, how do we use this “moment” to lead to a regenerative future rather than see it fizzle away?*\n\nThe mission of Regenerate Cascadia is to regenerate the Cascadia bioregion and create the conditions for a regenerative culture to thrive. As part of this, we educate about bioregionalism, grow the shared context of our place, and give direct funding for the core capacity of teams and projects. We provide much-needed administrative scaffolding as groups are beginning so they can receive and leverage decentralized flow funding and spin out new bioregional initiatives as part of a shared, coherent, multi-generational regeneration strategy.\n\nThis first funding round will assist our watershed working groups in locations throughout Cascadia and help us experiment with new forms of shared governance and participatory budgeting processes at the landscape level.\n\n# Now, we need your help to connect on-the-ground regenerative organizers, projects, and communities with the power and tools of Web3. \n\n![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/667c5f66bb46f07b901872e9_what-is-bff-3-layer-image-2-1024x775.png)\n*Figure 2: What is a BFF from the BioFi website - https://biofi.earth*\n\nWeb3 can help break down and move past arbitrary boundaries, map what is important to our communities, identify what needs to be protected, and connect portfolios of projects in the context of an entire landscape in ways we can directly fund and de-risk. We need to create tools for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) built through community consent and data sovereignty that help tell the stories of stewardship in ways that catalyze financial flows. \n\n**We deeply believe in the founding beliefs of these tools, as outlined by Celo:** \n>Web3 represents an internet where users have more control over their data, identity, and digital assets. This means no central authority controls the network, allowing for more transparency, security, and ownership. Web3 empowers individuals by giving them full control over their digital assets (like cryptocurrencies and NFTs) and how they interact with online services, making it a key shift towards a more open, user-owned internet.

Summary\n\nThe Recôncavo da Guanabara Bay Bioregional Fund aims to restore ecological integrity and foster socioeconomic resilience within the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This initiative addresses critical environmental and social challenges, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and socioeconomic inequality, impacting ecosystem services for approximately 14 million inhabitants in the wider region. Through the establishment of the Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara, a long-distance trail, the initiative connects diverse stakeholders, enhances community engagement, and promotes regenerative practices honoring the region's rich cultural heritage.\n\nContext and Need\n\nOverview of the Bioregion\nThe Reconcavo da Guanabara Bioregion, encompassing the municipalities of Magé, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, and Cachoeiras de Macacu, has a history marked by complex socio-environmental dynamics. The mountain ranges surrounding the region, such as the Serra dos Órgãos and the Serra da Estrela, are highly relevant to the landscape formation and water dynamics. The highest point in the region is Pedra do Sino, located in the Serra dos Órgãos, with an altitude of 2,275 meters.  The territorial identity is deeply influenced by the interaction between its communities and the rivers that flow through the region.  Among the main rivers are the Estrela River and the Inhomirim River, which play a central role in the local economy and ecology.  Once a prosperous economic hub during the colonial period, the region has suffered severe degradation over time due to uncontrolled industrialization, urban expansion, and poor land management. These factors have resulted in critical ecological and social challenges, particularly related to the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers\n- Environmental Degradation and Pollution: Inadequate land use in the cities of the Baixada Fluminense has severely impacted local ecosystems, with the siltation and pollution of essential rivers such as the Estrela and Inhomirim. Unregulated expansion, combined with the improper disposal of industrial and urban waste, deeply affects these water bodies. In Magé and Duque de Caxias, untreated sewage discharge and landfills, such as the now-closed Jardim Gramacho, overwhelm the rivers, impairing water supply and agriculture. Furthermore, the accumulation of waste and industrial pollution along these rivers has posed public health risks, while deforestation along riverbanks contributes to erosion and frequent flooding.\n- Biodiversity Loss: The region is part of the Atlantic Forest biome, recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, but only about 7% of the original forest cover remains, 5% has been recovered.  Deforestation, driven by agricultural and urban expansion, threatens native species, many of which are at risk of extinction. In Guapimirim and Cachoeiras de Macacu, the remaining forest areas, including the Serra dos Órgãos National Park, are vital for conservation but are also under pressure. Rivers like the Inhomirim, which flows through Guapimirim and Guanabara Bay, still host sensitive ecosystems, but their role in supporting biodiversity is threatened by pollution and improper land use.\n- Social Inequality: The Baixada Fluminense is characterized by stark social inequalities, with wealth concentrated in a few hands while widespread poverty persists. According to IBGE (Brazilian National Statistic Data) in cities like Magé and Duque de Caxias, more than 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Many of these communities are composed of descendants of enslaved Africans, who historically settled in quilombos and remain socially and economically marginalized. The chronic lack of basic infrastructure, such as sanitation and education, is a recurring problem, and the degradation of the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers further exacerbates the difficulties of these communities, which depend on these water sources for consumption and agricultural production.\n- Urban Challenges: The accelerated and unregulated urbanization in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense has strained local infrastructure. In Duque de Caxias, rapid population growth without adequate planning has resulted in critical issues such as insufficient public transport, inadequate sewage systems, and frequent power outages. The unregulated growth has also affected rural areas, especially in Magé and Guapimirim, where informal settlements along riverbanks increase the risk of flooding. The expansion of favelas without access to basic services creates precarious living conditions, and the lack of proper solid waste management increases the region's vulnerability to environmental disasters, exacerbating the impact of extreme weather events.\n\n\nOur Initiative: Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara\n\nThe initiative Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara is a 110 km long-distance trail that crosses five municipalities and connects 200,000 acres of nature which we are stewarding. This trail links three biohubs and passes through several conservation units, integrating key areas of ecological and cultural significance. The name reflects the deep heritage of the region, once a thriving economic and social hub during Portuguese colonization. By revitalizing this history, the trail promotes not only ecological restoration but also a reconnection with the cultural legacy of Guanabara Bay, fostering sustainable development and community engagement along its path.\nThe Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara serves as a sustainable development model by:\n- Protecting and restoring the Atlantic Forest.\n- Developing agro-ecological markets for sustainable products.\n- Promoting community-based tourism to celebrate local heritage.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Ecosystem Restoration: Re-establish ecological systems to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n2. Socio-Economic Development: Create sustainable bioeconomy opportunities for local communities through a joint purpose and shared resources.\n3.  Cultural Heritage Preservation: Acknowledge and empower the historical narrative and contributions of the African descendant population.\n\nEngagement with Stakeholders\nKey stakeholders involved in advancing this project include:\n- Sinal Do Vale: A major asset is our strong Biohub at Sinal do Vale, which has earned the trust of the community and has a proven track record in driving change. It excels at prototyping innovative, place-based solutions that are community-driven and locally supported.\n- Movimento Viva Água: A local capacity builder, collaborating with significant organizations for ecosystem restoration.\n- Beyonders Collective: Our collaboration with Beyonders, a catalyst agency,, strengthens the project by facilitating gatherings, providing leadership and coaching, and offering business development and capacity-building support for various regional initiatives.\n- Ecoaba: A local agronomic technical advisor who has relations with many farmers in the area and has successfully implemented regional agroforestry projects in the past.\nBioregional stakeholders: Our extensive network of bioregional stakeholders is another key resource. Over the past 20 years, we have built strong coalitions and guided these stakeholders toward a shared vision of sustainable development.\n- UN Decade Flagship Connection: Our deep ties to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, with Thais serving as co-chair, enable us to share insights globally and advocate for this model on an international stage.\n- Additionally, our three Biohubs are part of UNESCO’s Advanced Centres for the Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve, and we are recognized as a certified Global Ecosphere Retreat by The Long Run, meeting 83 sustainability indicators.\n\nThrough collaborative governance involving local communities and Indigenous Peoples, we will enhance sustainability and participatory decision-making.\n\nKey Achievements \n\n- Trail Mapping: We have established an officially recognised trail, consisting of nine segments that showcase the region's rich ecological diversity. Along the trail, we mapped 113 farms to assess their primary agricultural practices, identifying key challenges and opportunities to expand agroecology. Our survey revealed a wide variety of production systems and pinpointed priority areas for intervention, aimed at strengthening the agroecological corridor network and enhancing the economic resilience of local farmers.\n- Biodiversity Monitoring: In collaboration with UFRJ researchers, we have developed sustainable data collection and analysis processes to monitor local biodiversity effectively.\n- Youth Empowerment: We have trained 230 at-risk youth in entrepreneurial skills through targeted programs, helping them create new opportunities and fostering a new generation of leaders.\n- Community Infrastructure: We are upgrading infrastructure to support tourism and preserve local heritage sites, driving both economic growth and cultural preservation.\n- Business Model Prototyping: The Madre Frutos and Aboca projects have successfully moved beyond the pilot stage and are poised for expansion with new funding opportunities.\n\nOur initiative serves as a catalyst for incubating a regenerative value chain in the Recôncavo da Guanabara region, focused on both ecological restoration and community development. This model holds the potential to scale, serving as a blueprint for other bioregions around the world.\n\nA Global Opportunity\n\nWe have a unique opportunity to demonstrate a path forward as global attention turns to Brazil, with the upcoming Rio G20 and COP30 in Belém. Situated within the UN Flagship Mata Atlantica, one of the world's most biodiverse regions, we still have a chance to make a lasting impact. Success in this challenging environment could serve as a beacon of hope for ecological restoration worldwide.\n\nWhile we have the necessary partners, expertise, and conditions, we lack the financial frameworks to scale our impact.

This initiative addresses critical environmental and social challenges, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and socioeconomic inequality, impacting ecosystem services for approximately 14 million inhabitants in the wider region. Through the establishment of the Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara, a long-distance trail, the initiative connects diverse stakeholders, enhances community engagement, and promotes regenerative practices honoring the region's rich cultural heritage.\n\nContext and Need\n\nOverview of the Bioregion\nThe Reconcavo da Guanabara Bioregion, encompassing the municipalities of Magé, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, and Cachoeiras de Macacu, has a history marked by complex socio-environmental dynamics. The mountain ranges surrounding the region, such as the Serra dos Órgãos and the Serra da Estrela, are highly relevant to the landscape formation and water dynamics. The highest point in the region is Pedra do Sino, located in the Serra dos Órgãos, with an altitude of 2,275 meters.  The territorial identity is deeply influenced by the interaction between its communities and the rivers that flow through the region.  Among the main rivers are the Estrela River and the Inhomirim River, which play a central role in the local economy and ecology.  Once a prosperous economic hub during the colonial period, the region has suffered severe degradation over time due to uncontrolled industrialization, urban expansion, and poor land management. These factors have resulted in critical ecological and social challenges, particularly related to the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers\n- Environmental Degradation and Pollution: Inadequate land use in the cities of the Baixada Fluminense has severely impacted local ecosystems, with the siltation and pollution of essential rivers such as the Estrela and Inhomirim. Unregulated expansion, combined with the improper disposal of industrial and urban waste, deeply affects these water bodies. In Magé and Duque de Caxias, untreated sewage discharge and landfills, such as the now-closed Jardim Gramacho, overwhelm the rivers, impairing water supply and agriculture. Furthermore, the accumulation of waste and industrial pollution along these rivers has posed public health risks, while deforestation along riverbanks contributes to erosion and frequent flooding.\n- Biodiversity Loss: The region is part of the Atlantic Forest biome, recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, but only about 7% of the original forest cover remains, 5% has been recovered.  Deforestation, driven by agricultural and urban expansion, threatens native species, many of which are at risk of extinction. In Guapimirim and Cachoeiras de Macacu, the remaining forest areas, including the Serra dos Órgãos National Park, are vital for conservation but are also under pressure. Rivers like the Inhomirim, which flows through Guapimirim and Guanabara Bay, still host sensitive ecosystems, but their role in supporting biodiversity is threatened by pollution and improper land use.\n- Social Inequality: The Baixada Fluminense is characterized by stark social inequalities, with wealth concentrated in a few hands while widespread poverty persists. According to IBGE (Brazilian National Statistic Data) in cities like Magé and Duque de Caxias, more than 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Many of these communities are composed of descendants of enslaved Africans, who historically settled in quilombos and remain socially and economically marginalized. The chronic lack of basic infrastructure, such as sanitation and education, is a recurring problem, and the degradation of the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers further exacerbates the difficulties of these communities, which depend on these water sources for consumption and agricultural production.\n- Urban Challenges: The accelerated and unregulated urbanization in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense has strained local infrastructure. In Duque de Caxias, rapid population growth without adequate planning has resulted in critical issues such as insufficient public transport, inadequate sewage systems, and frequent power outages. The unregulated growth has also affected rural areas, especially in Magé and Guapimirim, where informal settlements along riverbanks increase the risk of flooding. The expansion of favelas without access to basic services creates precarious living conditions, and the lack of proper solid waste management increases the region's vulnerability to environmental disasters, exacerbating the impact of extreme weather events.\n\n\nOur Initiative: Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara\n\nThe initiative Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara is a 110 km long-distance trail that crosses five municipalities and connects 200,000 acres of nature which we are stewarding. This trail links three biohubs and passes through several conservation units, integrating key areas of ecological and cultural significance. The name reflects the deep heritage of the region, once a thriving economic and social hub during Portuguese colonization. By revitalizing this history, the trail promotes not only ecological restoration but also a reconnection with the cultural legacy of Guanabara Bay, fostering sustainable development and community engagement along its path.\nThe Caminho do Recôncavo da Guanabara serves as a sustainable development model by:\n- Protecting and restoring the Atlantic Forest.\n- Developing agro-ecological markets for sustainable products.\n- Promoting community-based tourism to celebrate local heritage.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Ecosystem Restoration: Re-establish ecological systems to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n2. Socio-Economic Development: Create sustainable bioeconomy opportunities for local communities through a joint purpose and shared resources.\n3.  Cultural Heritage Preservation: Acknowledge and empower the historical narrative and contributions of the African descendant population.\n\nEngagement with Stakeholders\nKey stakeholders involved in advancing this project include:\n- Sinal Do Vale: A major asset is our strong Biohub at Sinal do Vale, which has earned the trust of the community and has a proven track record in driving change. It excels at prototyping innovative, place-based solutions that are community-driven and locally supported.\n- Movimento Viva Água: A local capacity builder, collaborating with significant organizations for ecosystem restoration.\n- Beyonders Collective: Our collaboration with Beyonders, a catalyst agency,, strengthens the project by facilitating gatherings, providing leadership and coaching, and offering business development and capacity-building support for various regional initiatives.\n- Ecoaba: A local agronomic technical advisor who has relations with many farmers in the area and has successfully implemented regional agroforestry projects in the past.\nBioregional stakeholders: Our extensive network of bioregional stakeholders is another key resource. Over the past 20 years, we have built strong coalitions and guided these stakeholders toward a shared vision of sustainable development.\n- UN Decade Flagship Connection: Our deep ties to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, with Thais serving as co-chair, enable us to share insights globally and advocate for this model on an international stage.\n- Additionally, our three Biohubs are part of UNESCO’s Advanced Centres for the Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve, and we are recognized as a certified Global Ecosphere Retreat by The Long Run, meeting 83 sustainability indicators.\n\nThrough collaborative governance involving local communities and Indigenous Peoples, we will enhance sustainability and participatory decision-making.\n\nKey Achievements \n\n- Trail Mapping: We have established an officially recognised trail, consisting of nine segments that showcase the region's rich ecological diversity. Along the trail, we mapped 113 farms to assess their primary agricultural practices, identifying key challenges and opportunities to expand agroecology. Our survey revealed a wide variety of production systems and pinpointed priority areas for intervention, aimed at strengthening the agroecological corridor network and enhancing the economic resilience of local farmers.\n- Biodiversity Monitoring: In collaboration with UFRJ researchers, we have developed sustainable data collection and analysis processes to monitor local biodiversity effectively.\n- Youth Empowerment: We have trained 230 at-risk youth in entrepreneurial skills through targeted programs, helping them create new opportunities and fostering a new generation of leaders.\n- Community Infrastructure: We are upgrading infrastructure to support tourism and preserve local heritage sites, driving both economic growth and cultural preservation.\n- Business Model Prototyping: The Madre Frutos and Aboca projects have successfully moved beyond the pilot stage and are poised for expansion with new funding opportunities.\n\nOur initiative serves as a catalyst for incubating a regenerative value chain in the Recôncavo da Guanabara region, focused on both ecological restoration and community development. This model holds the potential to scale, serving as a blueprint for other bioregions around the world.\n\nA Global Opportunity\n\nWe have a unique opportunity to demonstrate a path forward as global attention turns to Brazil, with the upcoming Rio G20 and COP30 in Belém. Situated within the UN Flagship Mata Atlantica, one of the world's most biodiverse regions, we still have a chance to make a lasting impact. Success in this challenging environment could serve as a beacon of hope for ecological restoration worldwide.\n\nWhile we have the necessary partners, expertise, and conditions, we lack the financial frameworks to scale our impact. With Thais as co-chair of the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, we have a powerful platform to share our progress and insights, but we need financial support to turn this vision into reality.\n\n\nFunding Requirements\n\nTo expand the impact and sustainability of this initiative, we seek to raise a total of $2.2 million, allocated as follows:\n- Ecosystem Restoration Projects: $400,000\nReforestation and biodiversity monitoring.\n- Community Engagement and Capacity Building: $150,000\n- Training programs and workshops for local communities.\n- Bioeconomy projects $1.000.000\nMadre Frutos Jackfruit franchise model focused on employing women from disadvantaged areas.\nProduction of high quality fruits and herbs with Landless Owners Farmers for Biopharma company Aboca\nAgroforestry project in collaboration with Courageous Land\n- Infrastructure Enhancements for Community-Based Tourism: $450,000\nImprovements to trails and cultural heritage sites.\n- Monitoring and Evaluation: $300,000\nEstablishing a monitoring framework and data collection.\nManagement of fund, governance and reporting\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Recôncavo da Guanabara Bay Bioregional Fund represents a transformative opportunity to regenerate ecological spaces and local economies. By restoring the region's vital ecosystems while amplifying community identities and voices, we aim to create a sustainable future for the Baixada Fluminense.

Description: Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance\n\nRich Markdown Text (CODE)\n\n\n# About\n\n> \"Where Indigenous peoples live, there are forests, rivers, and abundance. Our relationship with our forests and rivers is not a relationship of 10 or 20 years—it is a relationship of more than 10,000 years. For thousands of years, we have preserved and defended nature through the strength of our cultures, worldview, and our respectful lifeway. Indigenous peoples do not talk about conserving nature; we talk about respecting nature because we see her as our family, we see her as the mother, we see her as our home.\n>\n> We have begun to join together all the efforts, all the tools, the spirits of our ancestors, and the visions of our wise elders, so that together with the global community we can defend our mother. Calling on governments, Indigenous peoples, and citizens everywhere to come together to protect our greater home! We must do this so that the river continues to feed us and the rainforests continue to heal us, because the Amazon is life. Because our headwaters are sacred!\"\n>\n> — **Gregorio Mirabal**, *Excerpt from the Forward to the Bioregional Plan 2030*\n\nTo include the image in your Markdown text, you can use the following code:\n\n\nTo include the image in your Markdown text, you can use the following code:\n\n\n![Miembros](https://i.postimg.cc/mkNtKpc8/Screen-Shot-2024-04-19-at-2-54-26-PM.png)\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2017, the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)** is an Indigenous-led alliance seeking to permanently protect more than **86 million acres** of tropical rainforests in the headwaters of the mighty Amazon River—the Napo, Pastaza, and Marañon Basins of Ecuador and Peru. The initiative has been building a shared long-term vision, capacity, and alliances for the designation of a bi-national protected region off-limits to industrial-scale resource extraction under Indigenous peoples' stewardship. We are advancing stronger Indigenous territorial rights while working to shift the dominant paradigm from the pursuit of economic growth and industrial development to a regenerative standing forest economy centered on the wellbeing of communities and the ecological integrity of the bioregion.\n\n![CSMAPA](https://i.postimg.cc/BnwXWK69/CSMAPA.png)\n\n## The Amazon Rainforest at the Tipping Point\n\nThe Amazon Basin, the Earth’s largest rainforest—home to 500+ Indigenous nations and unparalleled biodiversity—is reaching a tipping point of no return. Forest and biodiversity loss continue as a result of extractive pursuits carried out in the name of development such as mining, oil drilling, logging, and industrial agriculture.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest drives atmospheric rivers essential for the circulation of rainfall around the planet. The forest also sequesters carbon, regulates local and global weather patterns, and cools the climate. Scientists warn that the Amazon’s hydrological system is unraveling due to deforestation, and that this will likely trigger a massive forest dieback within decades unless we move urgently to protect and restore 80 percent of the Amazon’s forest cover.\n\n## About the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Sacred Headwaters region joined forces in 2017 and gave birth to the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)**—an initiative with the goal of protecting our rainforest territories, united by the common understanding that we all belong to an interconnected web of rivers and forests, and that we are all kin. When we unite, we can better protect our lands and our rights.\n\nASHA emerges as one of the world’s largest Indigenous-led forest protection initiatives. We are an alliance of **30 Indigenous nations and peoples** in Ecuador and Peru with a shared vision of permanently protecting **86 million acres** of bio-culturally diverse tropical rainforests (an area larger than Italy) in the headwaters of the mighty Amazon River, in the Napo, Pastaza, and Marañon Basins.\n\n![Cuencas sagradas](https://i.postimg.cc/BZDDxMv8/Cuencas-sagradas.jpg)\n\n## ASHA’s Key Funding Priorities\n\nWith Indigenous leadership at the helm, the Alliance is mobilizing and channeling funding to:\n\n- **Strengthen institutional capacity** of Indigenous member organizations for territorial governance, advocacy, project implementation, and financial management;\n- **Secure funding** to support Indigenous-led initiatives for food security, livelihood alternatives, forest monitoring, intercultural health/education, and renewable energy;\n- **Accompany and support** the pilot reforestation project and the Amazon Living School;\n- **Launch** the monitoring and evaluation system and the GIS platform, and design a project portfolio platform showcasing priority initiatives;\n- **Organize or participate** in joint communications/advocacy campaigns and legal actions to deter extractive industries and defend Indigenous rights and the rights of nature;\n- **Advance legal recognition** of Indigenous land claims covering 22 million acres of rainforests; and\n- **Propose systemic solutions** to incentivize forest protection and halt deforestation (canceling debt, wellbeing indicators, universal basic/intact forest income, bioeconomy hubs).\n\n![Climate Week](https://i.postimg.cc/pXwTVHvy/climateweek.jpg)\n\n## Our Theory of Change\n\nFor millennia, Indigenous peoples have demonstrated that it is possible to live in harmony with nature and in kinship with all life. Some of the best-preserved regions on Earth are areas inhabited by Indigenous peoples, boasting 80 percent of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and half of the world’s intact forests. Solutions emerging from our collective processes as communities and territories are rooted in our culture and traditional ecological knowledge.\n\nWhile Indigenous stewardship has been shown to be key to the success of forest protection efforts, less than 1% of pledged climate funding reaches Indigenous territories. Through this Alliance, we are joining together to mobilize significant financial and technical resources to ensure that our voices are heard, our rights are recognized, and our territories are protected.\n\nFor the governments of Ecuador and Peru to forgo their industrial ambitions for the Amazon, they must be persuaded to understand that protecting this bioregion is a win-win-win for Indigenous peoples, the Earth’s biosphere, and their nations’ long-term economic prosperity.

The initiative has been building a shared long-term vision, capacity, and alliances for the designation of a bi-national protected region off-limits to industrial-scale resource extraction under Indigenous peoples' stewardship. We are advancing stronger Indigenous territorial rights while working to shift the dominant paradigm from the pursuit of economic growth and industrial development to a regenerative standing forest economy centered on the wellbeing of communities and the ecological integrity of the bioregion.\n\n![CSMAPA](https://i.postimg.cc/BnwXWK69/CSMAPA.png)\n\n## The Amazon Rainforest at the Tipping Point\n\nThe Amazon Basin, the Earth’s largest rainforest—home to 500+ Indigenous nations and unparalleled biodiversity—is reaching a tipping point of no return. Forest and biodiversity loss continue as a result of extractive pursuits carried out in the name of development such as mining, oil drilling, logging, and industrial agriculture.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest drives atmospheric rivers essential for the circulation of rainfall around the planet. The forest also sequesters carbon, regulates local and global weather patterns, and cools the climate. Scientists warn that the Amazon’s hydrological system is unraveling due to deforestation, and that this will likely trigger a massive forest dieback within decades unless we move urgently to protect and restore 80 percent of the Amazon’s forest cover.\n\n## About the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Sacred Headwaters region joined forces in 2017 and gave birth to the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)**—an initiative with the goal of protecting our rainforest territories, united by the common understanding that we all belong to an interconnected web of rivers and forests, and that we are all kin. When we unite, we can better protect our lands and our rights.\n\nASHA emerges as one of the world’s largest Indigenous-led forest protection initiatives. We are an alliance of **30 Indigenous nations and peoples** in Ecuador and Peru with a shared vision of permanently protecting **86 million acres** of bio-culturally diverse tropical rainforests (an area larger than Italy) in the headwaters of the mighty Amazon River, in the Napo, Pastaza, and Marañon Basins.\n\n![Cuencas sagradas](https://i.postimg.cc/BZDDxMv8/Cuencas-sagradas.jpg)\n\n## ASHA’s Key Funding Priorities\n\nWith Indigenous leadership at the helm, the Alliance is mobilizing and channeling funding to:\n\n- **Strengthen institutional capacity** of Indigenous member organizations for territorial governance, advocacy, project implementation, and financial management;\n- **Secure funding** to support Indigenous-led initiatives for food security, livelihood alternatives, forest monitoring, intercultural health/education, and renewable energy;\n- **Accompany and support** the pilot reforestation project and the Amazon Living School;\n- **Launch** the monitoring and evaluation system and the GIS platform, and design a project portfolio platform showcasing priority initiatives;\n- **Organize or participate** in joint communications/advocacy campaigns and legal actions to deter extractive industries and defend Indigenous rights and the rights of nature;\n- **Advance legal recognition** of Indigenous land claims covering 22 million acres of rainforests; and\n- **Propose systemic solutions** to incentivize forest protection and halt deforestation (canceling debt, wellbeing indicators, universal basic/intact forest income, bioeconomy hubs).\n\n![Climate Week](https://i.postimg.cc/pXwTVHvy/climateweek.jpg)\n\n## Our Theory of Change\n\nFor millennia, Indigenous peoples have demonstrated that it is possible to live in harmony with nature and in kinship with all life. Some of the best-preserved regions on Earth are areas inhabited by Indigenous peoples, boasting 80 percent of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and half of the world’s intact forests. Solutions emerging from our collective processes as communities and territories are rooted in our culture and traditional ecological knowledge.\n\nWhile Indigenous stewardship has been shown to be key to the success of forest protection efforts, less than 1% of pledged climate funding reaches Indigenous territories. Through this Alliance, we are joining together to mobilize significant financial and technical resources to ensure that our voices are heard, our rights are recognized, and our territories are protected.\n\nFor the governments of Ecuador and Peru to forgo their industrial ambitions for the Amazon, they must be persuaded to understand that protecting this bioregion is a win-win-win for Indigenous peoples, the Earth’s biosphere, and their nations’ long-term economic prosperity. It is our premise that significant levels of international funding, investments, and financial mechanisms (e.g., debt forgiveness, climate and biodiversity adaptation and mitigation funds, philanthropy) can be mobilized and leveraged to incentivize the protection of the Sacred Headwaters region.\n\nWhat happens in the Amazon Headwaters ripples throughout the basin. It is urgent to shift to a new paradigm of well-being and harmony where the bioregion, the territories, cultures, biodiversity, and the regenerative economy are mutually flourishing.\n\n![COP28](https://i.postimg.cc/cJZ5Sr5h/COP28.jpg)\n\n## The Alliance’s Governance Structure\n\nSince 2017, our Alliance has grown to **27 member organizations**, of which **24 are Indigenous organizations**.

Project Overview:**\n**Project Title: \"Eco – Genesis : Integrating Climate Solutions, Nursery Gardens, and Natural Conservation for Sustainable Ecosystems\"**\n\nThe EcoGenesis Project is a mission to accelerate blockchain-enabled climate solutions globally. Our project aims to establish a sustainable nursery that serves as a hub for plant propagation, reforestation, and community education, thereby contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a sustainable and equitable future for all.\n\n**2. Project Objectives:**\nThe primary objectives of the Nursery Garden for Climate Solutions project are:\n**2.1 Reforestation and Biodiversity Conservation:**Establish a nursery to propagate and cultivate native tree species, emphasizing those with high carbon sequestration potential and adaptability to local climate conditions.This includes Propagating native plants for reforestation and habitat restoration.\n**2.2 Climate Change Mitigation:** Contribute to mitigating climate change by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance overall environmental resilience.This includes sequestering carbon through tree planting and ecosystem restoration.\n**2.3 Environmental Education:**Conduct workshops, awareness campaigns, and training programs for local communities on the importance of tree planting, environmental conservation, and sustainable land management practices.\n**2.4 Livelihood Enhancement:** Provide employment opportunities for local residents in the nursery operations, fostering economic sustainability and community involvement.\n**2.5\tIntegrating Blockchain Technology in Project Evaluation :** Leveraging blockchain technology to track and verify the environmental impact of the nursery's activities.\n \n![Alt Text]( https://i.postimg.cc/mZ6k7MR9/Process.jpg)\n\n**Detailed Description of Climate Impact:**\nThe Nursery Garden for Climate Solutions project in Chinnamanur is designed to have a significant and lasting impact on the local climate and environment. The following aspects provide a detailed understanding of the climate impact of this project:\n**1. Carbon Sequestration and Mitigation:**\nObjective: The primary goal of the project is to mitigate climate change by promoting the cultivation and planting of native tree species known for their high carbon sequestration capacity.\n**Climate Impact:** Trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and storing it in their biomass. By planting a variety of native trees, the project aims to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, directly mitigating the impacts of climate change.\n**Expected Outcome:** Planting and maintaining at least 2,000 trees annually, with blockchain-enabled tracking of carbon sequestration.\n**2. Biodiversity Conservation and Ecological Resilience:**\n**Objective:**The project focuses on reforestation with an emphasis on native species, promoting biodiversity and enhancing the overall ecological resilience of the region.\n**Climate Impact:** Biodiverse ecosystems are more resilient to climate change. By restoring and conserving local flora, the project aims to create habitats for various species, fostering biodiversity and contributing to the adaptation of ecosystems to changing climate conditions.\n**Expected Outcome:** Propagation of at least 10,000 native plants annually for reforestation projects.\n**3.

Nation CoLabs** is determined to address the polycrisis from the bottom up by transforming the system of finance. In flowing capital to support regeneration (instead of extraction) and prioritizing accountability to community and nature (instead of profit) - we will shape new patterns of being in reciprocity with the land and each other.\n\nGiven this, we focus on how we resource the local-led innovations that will allow watersheds across this bioregion to demonstrate what a more hopeful and thriving future could look like. Money is energy, and empowering local people to self-determine what it means to thrive will involve radically changing how capital flows to grassroots efforts. \n\nCoLabs grows its impact through the formation of small, distributed collaborations (Labs). These Labs each have their specific approach to flowing finance to bioregions - but work as a family of collaborators to cross pollinate ideas, relationships, and collective momentum with each other.  Each of our Labs contains a full spectrum of collaborators, offering a synergy of perspectives.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/670eacd695be1572f3bf5bec/670fea39e2ff4956687015c0_Collaboration%20Slide%20V2%20.jpg)\n\nTo move our current economy towards valuing and rewarding regeneration - each of our Labs is focused on launching an initiative with one or more of these three key areas of innovation: **the rights of nature to thrive, ecosystem service markets, and governance that is in service to life**.

Through the [Bringing the Salmon Home](https://columbiariversalmon.ca/) partnership across three First Nations (Sylix Okanagan, Ktunaxa, and Secwépemc), they have brought sockeye salmon back to the Okanagan from a low of 3,000 (25 years ago) to 800,000 this year making up 70% of the sockeye that returned to the Columbia River basin - the mightiest salmon river in the world. The story of renewal and regeneration here is inspiring, and tremendous but also vulnerable to the loss of government funding and industrial agriculture. We are working with and weaving together impact investors, university partners, producers, food businesses, indigenous entrepreneurs, and industry associations to identify strategic investments and unite local people into a One Okanagan alliance that supports, values, and regeneratively finances the work of people who are stewarding the land, waters, and salmon of this place. To find out more, please visit [our Notion page](https://edgefinance.notion.site/Financing-Bioregional-Communities-4d143b0b784543829ee43b3c86507eac). \n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/670eacd695be1572f3bf5bec/670f49de88f4b57625746144_OCN%20Team%20Slide.png)\n\n**Salmon Nation Rematriation Fund**\n+ Governing how financial resources flow is a key issue of our time.

Salmon show us how we are connected to the land, the waters and each other. In this bioregion defined by salmon - indigenous people are reclaiming meaningful relationships to their lands and waters on their own terms, and playing an increasingly influential role in their territories’ cultural, economic, scientific and legal evolution. It is also where a symbiosis is emerging between old and new ways of living, of two-eyed seeing through both indigenous knowledge and western perspectives, of re-interpreting — through art, song, theater, new media, language, and unlikely collaborations in all manner of experiments at the watershed level — how we share wisdom and resources in ways that are more equitable, and ultimately richer and more meaningful for people and place.\n\n# History/Context\nThe idea of Salmon Nation has been around for 30+ years through an organization called [Ecotrust](http://www.ecotrust.org), founded in 1992 by Spencer Beebe.

In flowing capital to support regeneration (instead of extraction) and prioritizing accountability to community and nature (instead of profit) - we will shape new patterns of being in reciprocity with the land and each other.\n\nGiven this, we focus on how we resource the local-led innovations that will allow watersheds across this bioregion to demonstrate what a more hopeful and thriving future could look like. Money is energy, and empowering local people to self-determine what it means to thrive will involve radically changing how capital flows to grassroots efforts. \n\nCoLabs grows its impact through the formation of small, distributed collaborations (Labs). These Labs each have their specific approach to flowing finance to bioregions - but work as a family of collaborators to cross pollinate ideas, relationships, and collective momentum with each other.  Each of our Labs contains a full spectrum of collaborators, offering a synergy of perspectives.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/670eacd695be1572f3bf5bec/670fea39e2ff4956687015c0_Collaboration%20Slide%20V2%20.jpg)\n\nTo move our current economy towards valuing and rewarding regeneration - each of our Labs is focused on launching an initiative with one or more of these three key areas of innovation: **the rights of nature to thrive, ecosystem service markets, and governance that is in service to life**.

Northland: Catalyzing Community-Led Regeneration \n\nSpanning 2.5 million acres by 2050, Reconnecting Northland supports remote communities in achieving sustainable environmental regeneration, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting economic vitality and social well-being. Northland boasts the highest biodiversity in Aotearoa New Zealand, but the region faces severe species decline, among the highest globally. By empowering communities with the right knowledge, tools, and resources, we enable them to lead the socio-ecological transformation through regenerative local economies. We believe in catalyzing the changes needed for our communities to become resilient and flourish in harmony with the natural environment. \n\nFounded in 2012 with support from the Tindall Foundation and Foundation North, Reconnecting Northland Trust has evolved from a connectivity conservation model to a community-led initiative tailored to Northland's socio-cultural and socio-economic realities. Over seven years, we’ve refined our practice to champion community-led action, rooted in indigenous principles. We support long-term aspirations by fostering relationships and providing tools, financing, and resources, collaborating with like-minded organizations to create unified, community-tailored plans. Our team of seven staff and six kairaranga (community coordinators) actively supports communities to deliver landscape-scale initiatives, currently working with 14 groups across Northland. \n\nWith over 50% of our team and our CEO being indigenous Māori, and more than 80% of our community interactions being with Māori groups, Reconnecting Northland is deeply rooted in indigenous leadership. We embrace Te Ao Mārama—a Māori worldview that fosters clarity, connectedness, and harmony with nature—guiding our work toward ecological regeneration. Achieving Te Ao Mārama requires integrating indigenous knowledge, western science, local expertise, and self-awareness to ensure best practices emerge. \n\nAt the core of our strategy is elevating the Māori worldview as a catalyst for regeneration across Northland. We weave indigenous knowledge into ecological, financial, and human regeneration practices, building a framework that supports community-led socio-ecological action. Reconnecting Northland functions as a Connectivity Catalyst, seed-funding communities to become investment-ready while connecting them to tools and resources that accelerate change and build capability. Our work promotes nature-based enterprises to reduce reliance on grants, fostering regenerative revenue streams. \n\nAfter seven years of refining our approach, we are seeking benefactors to help us scale our activities. We’ve helped communities across entire catchments develop 100-year visions and action plans, rapidly building on-the-ground capability. Our communities are ready to effectively deploy the capital required for intergenerational socio-ecological change. \n\nOur strategy, shaped by lessons from our Tapere (large landscape initiative), addresses barriers like siloed, short-term competitive funding and limited access to support services. Our two core projects—Connectivity Partnership (syndicated investment supporting Catchment Action Plans) and Te Kete Hononga (streamlined support for local capability building)—are designed to overcome these challenges. \n\nGrowing local capability and creating job opportunities to allow people to return to their ancestral lands is essential for community-led regeneration. Over the past seven years, we’ve listened carefully to communities, who have told us what resources, connections, funding, and training they need. In response, we developed and successfully trialed Te Kete Hononga, which weaves together tailored support packages to realize community-led initiatives while building resilience through trusted Kairaranga (community facilitators). \n\nThe profound success of the Te Kete Hononga trial has proven that our community-led model for regeneration works—and now, we are ready to take the next bold step. To scale our impact across Northland and beyond, we need visionary partners to join us. By securing syndicated investment, we can rapidly expand Te Kete Hononga, accelerating the growth of capability and capacity within communities. This investment will empower local people to lead the socio-ecological transformation, creating resilient ecosystems, strong local economies, and a blueprint for global change. Together, we can catalyze a future where people and nature thrive. \n\nLearn more about our journey at www.ReconnectingNorthland.org.nz or watch our story unfold here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WDZ6BNE99Y&t=1s","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":""},"recipient":"0xc62810Cb04295d4798FFBd6314bBF1ED84592f8a"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreibsbzknpwra4hl2exftpng5mewx46jz6n2o55yaas6mr44phgrzw4","projects":[{"name":"Reconnecting Northland","id":"0xe31ba0896a5c956c6ebd1abf7bc4a43b20ff0e4bb06b6bd6210be7213bab9c1d","metadata":{"title":"Reconnecting Northland","logoImg":"bafkreigeb7xc37alkt2ehndtgnhngmiwpouueybukenyqnit3giehokru4","website":"https://www.reconnectingnorthland.org.nz","bannerImg":"bafkreigo355fjelmusf4ray7nxbxw44wamx3g5ca4tjoknlgvk4fofg6ti","createdAt":1729486803694,"credentials":{},"description":"Reconnecting Northland: Catalyzing Community-Led Regeneration \n\nSpanning 2.5 million acres by 2050, Reconnecting Northland supports remote communities in achieving sustainable environmental regeneration, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting economic vitality and social well-being.

Our two core projects—Connectivity Partnership (syndicated investment supporting Catchment Action Plans) and Te Kete Hononga (streamlined support for local capability building)—are designed to overcome these challenges. \n\nGrowing local capability and creating job opportunities to allow people to return to their ancestral lands is essential for community-led regeneration. Over the past seven years, we’ve listened carefully to communities, who have told us what resources, connections, funding, and training they need. In response, we developed and successfully trialed Te Kete Hononga, which weaves together tailored support packages to realize community-led initiatives while building resilience through trusted Kairaranga (community facilitators). \n\nThe profound success of the Te Kete Hononga trial has proven that our community-led model for regeneration works—and now, we are ready to take the next bold step. To scale our impact across Northland and beyond, we need visionary partners to join us. By securing syndicated investment, we can rapidly expand Te Kete Hononga, accelerating the growth of capability and capacity within communities. This investment will empower local people to lead the socio-ecological transformation, creating resilient ecosystems, strong local economies, and a blueprint for global change. Together, we can catalyze a future where people and nature thrive. \n\nLearn more about our journey at www.ReconnectingNorthland.org.nz or watch our story unfold here

It has a population of 10 million people (a quarter of Canada's population, including Canada's largest city Toronto). It's on the Great Lakes, which have 21% of the world's fresh water. The GTB is organized by watersheds through 13 Conservation Authorities, and has the largest Greenbelt in the world. This diverse urban/rural bioregion is pursuing whole-systems work through both social and ecological regeneration. You can help us #ChangeTheStory for all generations now and into the future.\n\n\nThe Legacy Project, a research and innovation group led by Brian Puppa and Susan Bosak, is the Core Team for the GTB – because this work is the legacy project of our time. The history of the local bioregional work goes back to a 1992 *Regeneration* report by former Toronto Mayor and federal cabinet minister David Crombie. Said Crombie, \"This approach is both a way of doing things and a way of thinking. It's not a new concept. Indigenous peoples have long understood their connectedness to the ecosystem – the land, water, air, and other life. Thinking about the whole bioregion helps focus attention on the interdependencies – everything is connected to everything else.\" We did a [short documentary with David Crombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj9RdN_wx4g).\n\nWe're working to #ChangeTheStory in the context of lifetimes across generations. We draw on an Indigenous concept of holistic, long-term thinking across seven generations while at the same time reflecting the modern context of a historic demographic shift. For the first time in history, as more people live longer, we will personally know (in our family and/or community) seven generations – our own generation; three before us (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents); and three after us (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren). There is significant comfort, insight, and power in this ability to \"touch time,\" to connect more generations than ever before.\n\nWe are also pursuing a Third Way – bringing Indigenous worldviews and knowledge together with Western science in a way that will enable us to walk into the greatest existential challenge humanity has ever faced. Check out this [video discussion featuring Dr. Dan Longboat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nYb_njU17g) of the Indigenous Environmental Institute at Trent University.\n\nIn addition to being part of the Great Lakes Basin with 21% of the Earth's fresh water, the GTB has a couple of other [unique features](https://legacyproject.org/7gen/GTBLandFeatures.pdf). The **Niagara Escarpment**, on the west side of the GTB, is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It stretches 725 km over a range of 430 m in elevations, and includes Great Lakes coastlines, cliff edges, talus slopes, wetlands, woodlands, limestone alvar pavements, oak savannahs, conifer swamps. It has 300 bird species, 55 mammals, 36 reptiles and amphibians, 90 fish and 100 varieties of special interest flora, as well as Cedar trees that are over 1,000 years old. The other unique feature of the GTB is the **Oak Ridges Moraine**, which is the *heart* of the bioregion. The Oak Ridges Moraine is a unique formation of sand and gravel deposits that captures rainwater, filters it, and slowly releases it into the landscape like a giant sponge. There are 16 major rivers and 66 river valley systems in the area.\n\nFollowing in David Crombie's footsteps, the Legacy Project has been doing whole-systems work for two decades and renewed the GTB vision three years ago. We frame it as growing a [Tree of Life](https://legacyproject.org/7gen/TreeOfLife.pdf) – creating structures and processes to navigate through our current planetary predicament toward a fractally scale-linked story of Bioregional Earth.\n\nTo help bring this vision alive, we ran the six-day [7-Generation Bioregional Earth Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBvxKv2Ie4M) in February, 2024. As a hybrid conference, several hundred people were involved locally as well as several thousand online. The Summit created momentum for the local work and laid the foundation for the recently launched [Bioregional Earth website](https://www.bioregionalearth.org), co-stewarded by Susan Bosak, Brian Puppa, Joe Brewer, and Penny Heiple.\n\nA civilization is about the deep story we all share over time – the meanings, values, structures, processes that guide us collectively. Story is the most effective way human beings have to navigate through the world. Can we live into a **story of Bioregional Earth** based on right relationship with each other and the Earth – one that puts life at the center of every decision and action in the context of Natural Law. To regenerate the entire Earth, we need this awareness woven into the daily ways we perceive, think, feel, and act.\n\nWe draw on the [Bioregional Regeneration Platform](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/BioregionalRegenerationPlatform.pdf) developed by Joe Brewer, who is Co-Founder with Penny Heiple of the Design School for Regenerating Earth. This is a whole-systems approach that brings together and creates a rich interconnected context for the structures of a Bioregional Learning Center with a Portfolio of Projects and Funding/Governance. This approach to the work is about, in the words of Joe Brewer, \"organizing *with* the incredible natural intelligence of local living systems within our bioregions.\" We need to be learning, working on the ground, and funding (flowing value) all at the same time. Find out more about holistic Bioregional Funding Ecosystems in this [three-part video series](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/fundingecosystems.html).\n\nWe have a [GTB Portfolio of Projects](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/GTBBioregionalFunding.pdf) – with a wide diversity of social and ecological regeneration projects ready to go, from small projects needing $5,000 to much larger projects that cross the bioregion, like the GeoAI land cover mapping which will support both strategic planning and monitoring. The map will be a knowledge commons for the GTB, used by Conservation Authorities (organized by watersheds), municipalities, the public, and others. It will include cultural and Indigenous layers for deeper bioregional thinking.\n\nFind out more about the projects in the GTB, the development of the Bioregional Funding Ecosystem, and meet some of the people/organizations involved in this evocative [video summary from the recent Bioregional Regenerative Finance Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwXkWBzjQEM) which took place in the GTB.\n\nAll generations in the GTB are coming together to support the bioregional regeneration vision.

Rooted in ancient wisdom and modern innovation, we seek to create a unified network of local nodes, organizations, and projects dedicated to addressing the region's ecological, social, and economic challenges. Through collaboration, resource sharing, and impact-driven strategies, we aim to align diverse efforts under a shared vision of bioregional regeneration.\n\nWith its unique blend of cultures, landscapes, and histories, the Mediterranean region is both a site of profound challenges and rich opportunities for regeneration. By weaving together the strengths of grassroots movements and cutting-edge digital tools, ReFi Mediterranean will foster a coordinated response to crises such as climate change, rural depopulation, and economic stagnation. Through a phased approach, ReFi Mediterranean will begin by mapping and connecting regenerative finance nodes and assets across the region, eventually scaling toward a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy** and establishing a **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** to support long-term transformation.\n\n# Our Bioregion: A Tapestry of Land, Sea, and Culture\n\nThe Mediterranean, often hailed as the cradle of civilization, is a bioregion where history, culture, and nature have been intricately woven together for millennia. The Mediterranean is a complex mosaic, its boundaries defined not by political borders but by the rhythms of nature and shared cultural heritage. Our bioregion encompasses four key areas:\n\n- **West**: The sun-drenched coasts of Portugal, Spain, and southern France.\n- **Central**: The Italian peninsula and the Adriatic shores of Croatia.\n- **East**: The ancient lands of Greece, coastal Türkiye, and the Levant.\n- **South**: The North African coast, stretching from Morocco to Egypt.\n\nAt the heart of our bioregion lies the Mediterranean Sea, an azure thread connecting diverse landscapes and cultures. For centuries, it has served as a conduit for trade, exchanging not just goods but ideas, languages, and ways of life. The very essence of Mediterranean culture—from our olive oil and wine to our philosophies and art—has been shaped by this intermingling of peoples and traditions.\n\nToday the Mediterranean stands at a crossroads, facing a web of interconnected challenges. Climate collapse, political turmoil, and economic instability have cast long shadows over this once-flourishing bioregion. Mass tourism threatens to turn vibrant local cultures into mere backdrops for vacation photos, while fossil fuel extraction risks transforming the Mediterranean Sea into a gas field and potential conflict zone. The impacts of climate change, including droughts, wildfires, and desertification, are increasingly severe, and political instability in the southern regions has sparked humanitarian crises as people seek safety across treacherous waters. The Mediterranean also contends with bureaucratic inertia, rural depopulation, and the ongoing migration crisis, which further strain the region’s ecosystems and communities. Industrial agriculture and political borders disrupt the natural interconnectedness of the region, while the Mediterranean Sea suffers from pollution, overfishing, and other environmental pressures.\n\nYet, within each of these challenges lies the seed of opportunity for regeneration. Communities are banding together to organize reforestation efforts and fire watch activities. The spread of regenerative agriculture and syntropic agroforestry, adapted to the unique Mediterranean climate, offers pathways to heal depleted soils, revitalize rural areas, and create stronger community bonds. We are also witnessing a reverse migration, as people from northern Europe trade their corporate jobs for a slower, sun-soaked lifestyle. This influx is breathing new life into abandoned areas and sparking the creation of innovative ecovillages, like the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/) in Portugal.\n\nWhile ReFi Mediterranean does not seek to tackle all of the regions challenges at once, it aims to build on our network's strengths and play our part in creating ripples of transformation that lead to systemic change. Our efforts will lay groundwork for a comprehensive [Bioregional Regeneration Strategy](https://www.biofi.earth/activation-guide), guiding the Mediterranean toward a regenerative and resilient future. We seek to unite efforts, weaving together ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology to form a cohesive network of regeneration. We aim to restore the sacred balance between people, land, and sea, ensuring the Mediterranean becomes a beacon of sustainability and resilience for generations to come.\n\nThe essence of our vision: not merely to live the \"sweet life\" (la dolce vita) - for which the Mediterranean is famed - but to build a \"regenerative life\" (**la vita rigenerativa**) that restores balance and harmony to our bioregion.\n\n![ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration](https://i.ibb.co/Tv4SZrk/med.png \"ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration\")\n\n# Our Organizing Team: A Nested Network of Changemakers\n\nThe ReFi Mediterranean initiative is a vibrant, nested network of local nodes, projects, and regional coordinating bodies, each deeply rooted in their specific territories and communities. This structure allows for agile, localized action while fostering cohesion and collaboration across the bioregion.

This collaborative leadership structure allows for flexibility and responsiveness as the initiative takes shape. As ReFi Mediterranean matures, the aim is to further establish, formalise, and decentralise the organizational structure, ensuring that it evolves in alignment with the needs of the bioregion and its growing network.\n\n**Current Leadership for ReFi Mediterranean**:\n\n- **Regen Avocado** (Rifai Sicilia) - https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia\n- **Raffaele Izzia** (ReFi Italia) - https://x.com/izziaraffaele\n- **Maria Falbo** (ReFi Calabria & Copson Universe) - https://linktr.ee/mariafalbo\n- **Monty Merlin** (ReFi DAO & Regen Coordination) - https://linktr.ee/montybryant\n- **Luiz Fernando** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/louizfe\n\n**Network Representatives and Advisers**:\n\n- **Rica** (ReFi Lisboa) - https://linktr.ee/ricaax\n- **Andrea Farias** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/andrea_is_a\n- **Samuel Delesque** (Traditional Dream Factory) - https://samueldelesque.me/\n- **Sohto** (Earthist & ReFi Turkey) - https://x.com/soht0\n- **Scott Morris** (ReFi DAO) - https://x.com/thetokenjedi\n\nThe power of ReFi Mediterranean lies in its ability to bring together a diverse network of changemakers, each with their own unique expertise, vision, and connection to place. As we deepen our connections across the bioregion, we are cultivating a movement that is not just about solving immediate crises but about creating long-lasting systems of regeneration.\n\n# Our Vision: Uniting for Bioregional Regeneration\n\nReFi Mediterranean seeks to connect and scale the efforts of its local ReFi nodes and aligned projects, building on existing regenerative work to create synergies that enhance collaboration and maximize collective impact across the bioregion. Many of the activities listed below are already in progress within local nodes, and the plan is to coordinate and expand these initiatives to deepen their regenerative impact across the Mediterranean.\n\n### Immediate Focus (Short-Term)\n\n1. **Education, Resource Sharing, and Ecosystem Mapping**: Local nodes are gathering practical resources on ReFi apps, Web3 tools, decentralized governance, and regenerative practices tailored to their specific communities. ReFi Mediterranean will scale these efforts by creating an ecosystem map that highlights ReFi-aligned initiatives across the Mediterranean, connecting local value-driven movements with global tech-enablers. This comprehensive map will serve as a tool for collaboration and broader community education across the bioregion.\n2. **Network Building**: Local nodes are organizing workshops and meetups to foster connections. By coordinating these efforts, ReFi Mediterranean will establish a bioregion-wide network of regenerative projects, strengthening partnerships and facilitating shared learning through conferences and collaborative events.\n3. **Cultural and Spiritual Regeneration**: Local nodes are working to revitalize sacred practices and embed decolonial approaches. ReFi Mediterranean aims to expand these efforts, positioning the Mediterranean as a hub for cultural, spiritual, and agricultural renewal that transcends tourism.\n4. **Storytelling and Amplification**: Many nodes are already capturing and [sharing stories of regeneration.](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146) ReFi Mediterranean will scale this work by developing a cohesive multimedia narrative that amplifies local efforts, engages global audiences, and invites wider participation in regenerative initiatives.\n\n### Building the Foundations (Mid-Term)\n\n1. **Funding and Support**: Participatory mechanisms for fund allocation are already in use by local groups. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale these processes, facilitating transparent and impactful resource distribution to regenerative projects across the bioregion.\n2. **Data Commons and Ecological Monitoring**: Several nodes are developing systems to track ecological health and monitor regenerative progress. ReFi Mediterranean aims to build on this by creating a shared data infrastructure to aggregate and share this information across the region, supporting informed decision-making and collective impact reporting.\n\n### Future Horizon (Long-Term)\n\n1. **Regenerative Marketplace and Investment Fund**: Some local nodes are exploring regenerative markets and revenue-sharing models. ReFi Mediterranean aims to establish an on-chain marketplace where regenerative producers can sell their products, with portions of revenues reinvested into community treasuries to support local regeneration.\n2. **Bioregional Investment Fund**: As funding needs grow, ReFi Mediterranean envisions creating a bioregion-wide investment fund to channel larger investments into critical regenerative infrastructure projects, fostering sustainable growth.\n3. **Policy Innovation Lab**: Some nodes are already engaging with policymakers. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale this by collaborating across the region to pilot innovative governance models that align with bioregional principles, driving systemic change.\n4. **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & BFF**: Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs in the region to develop a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy that can inform the further development of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFF) to support long-term regenerative projects and systemic change across the Mediterranean.\n\nBy coordinating and scaling these activities, ReFi Mediterranean aims to build a connected, resilient bioregional ecosystem. This network not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term pathways to systemic regeneration and renewal. Aligned with the broader Regen Coordination movement, ReFi Mediterranean seeks to develop common infrastructure and alignment across the ecosystem, focusing on the aggregation of impact data from connected organizations. This data will be linked to both local and global funding sources to maximize transparency and effectiveness in resource allocation. As the network expands, ReFi Mediterranean aims to deepen collaboration between local nodes, amplifying shared efforts while building a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Through this process of mapping, knowledge-sharing, and coordinated resource management, ReFi Mediterranean aspires to create the necessary pathways for scaling regenerative finance across the Mediterranean, fostering systemic change throughout the bioregion.\n\n# Our Finances: Innovating Resource Flows\n\nOur approach to finance is as interconnected as the Mediterranean itself. We're pioneering a nested model of resource management that allows for local autonomy while fostering bioregion-wide collaboration.\n\n### Current Financial Ecosystem\n\n1. **Local Node Fundraising**: Each node raises funds independently, often through platforms like Gitcoin & ReFi DAO’s Local Node funding rounds.\n2. **Transparent Distribution**: Funds raised are often redistributed to local projects through open, participatory processes. ReFi Italia has been a leader in this, facilitating collective decision-making on fund allocation. ReFi Barcelona is also experimenting with a Quadratic Funding round for their local network.\n3. **Impact Tracking**: Nodes like RiFai Sicilia and Earthist DAO are using platforms like Bloom Network to write impact reports, earning FLO tokens that can be converted into other cryptocurrencies.\n4. **Yield Generation**: We're learning to manage on-chain treasuries, including strategies for generating yield on idle funds through DeFi protocols.\n\n### Vision for BioFi Resource Management\n\nAs we evolve, we're working towards a more sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem that reimagines where value is placed and how it flows:\n\n1. **Bioregional Treasury**: We're establishing a BioFi Mediterranean multi-sig wallet, with representatives from each local node as signers. This will allow us to manage bioregion-wide resources collectively.\n2. **Nested Governance**: Local nodes will maintain their own treasuries and decision-making processes, nested within the larger bioregional structure. This allows for customized local solutions while enabling coordination on larger initiatives.\n3. **Participatory Allocation**: We're developing mechanisms for participatory budgeting at multiple scales, from local nodes up to the bioregional level.\n4. **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: We're exploring the creation of a Mediterranean regenerative token system that could facilitate value exchange across the bioregion while incentivizing regenerative activities.\n5. **Blended Finance Approaches**: We aim to create pathways for traditional finance to support our work, potentially through mechanisms like green bonds or impact investing vehicles tailored to bioregional regeneration.\n6. **Value Reimagination**: Inspired by models such as the [Eight Forms of Capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf), we're pioneering a shift in how financial value is perceived and allocated. Instead of focusing solely on consumer goods, we're creating mechanisms to direct financial flows towards building regenerative futures, supporting sacred practices, and nurturing love within our communities.\n7. **Cultural Onboarding and Web3 Bridge**: We're developing innovative storytelling approaches to onboard cultural interest in our bioregional regeneration efforts, weaving together ancient Mediterranean mythology with new narratives. We aim to bridge cultural gaps within diverse Mediterranean communities and between traditional and new economies. This includes creating accessible educational materials about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in local languages and dialects, inviting wider participation and financial contributions towards building a thriving future for our bioregion.\n\n# Our Action Plan: A Phased Approach to Transformation\n\nThe ambition of ReFi Mediterranean is far-reaching, with the ultimate goal of accelerating a regenerative transition across the bioregion. However, to manage scope effectively and ensure success, a phased approach has been developed, with clear, achievable actions and milestones to guide progress. Given the potential size of the resources raised from this grant application, the primary focus will be on fulfilling Phase 1 of the action plan. This will lay the foundation for further development, with an intention to initiate collaborations and raise additional funding to support subsequent phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Mapping and Case Study Library\n\n- **Goal**: To establish a comprehensive overview of local nodes and projects within the Mediterranean region.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Map ReFi local nodes and place-based ReFi & Web3 activities across the region.\n    - Create a **Case Study Library** documenting the models and activities being implemented.\n    - Gain insights into the diverse applications of ReFi Web3 technologies and use these insights to inform the next phases of ReFi Mediterranean and other bioregional strategies.\n\n### Phase 2: Bioregional Impact Data Commons\n\n- **Goal**: To create a shared data infrastructure that supports the aggregation of impact data across local nodes and projects.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Develop a **Bioregional Data Commons** to monitor ecological health, track regenerative efforts, and guide decision-making.\n    - In collaboration with **Regen Coordination**, design and implement a collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for the ecosystem of ReFi Mediterranean.\n    - Bring impact data on-chain, ensuring transparency and verifiability through Web3 technologies. This system will enable accurate and reliable reporting from local nodes and projects, fostering coherence, trust, and transparency.\n    - Aggregate this data for alignment with local and global grant sources and technology solutions.\n\nAs ReFi Mediterranean becomes proficient in measuring, aggregating, and reporting its impact, it will attract a broader range of capital beyond Web3 grant funding, diversifying its financing and reinvesting resources into regenerative projects.\n\n### Phase 3: Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)\n\n- **Goal**: To create a comprehesive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and establish a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) to support regenerative initiatives in the Mediterranean.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs and stakeholders, including local governments and NGOs, to develop a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.\n    - Use this strategy as the foundation for launching the first **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** in the Mediterranean, a key resource for scaling regenerative projects.\n    - Establish financial support systems and capital distribution mechanisms to effectively fund ReFi Mediterranean initiatives.\n    - Expand the ReFi Toolkit, knowledge resources, and frameworks for ecosystem-wide adoption.\n\n# Thank you 💚\n\nOnly together can we build a regenerative future, for our bioregion and beyond.

This collaborative leadership structure allows for flexibility and responsiveness as the initiative takes shape. As ReFi Mediterranean matures, the aim is to further establish, formalise, and decentralise the organizational structure, ensuring that it evolves in alignment with the needs of the bioregion and its growing network.\n\n**Current Leadership for ReFi Mediterranean**:\n\n- **Regen Avocado** (Rifai Sicilia) - https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia\n- **Raffaele Izzia** (ReFi Italia) - https://x.com/izziaraffaele\n- **Maria Falbo** (ReFi Calabria & Copson Universe) - https://linktr.ee/mariafalbo\n- **Monty Merlin** (ReFi DAO & Regen Coordination) - https://linktr.ee/montybryant\n- **Luiz Fernando** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/louizfe\n\n**Network Representatives and Advisers**:\n\n- **Rica** (ReFi Lisboa) - https://linktr.ee/ricaax\n- **Andrea Farias** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/andrea_is_a\n- **Samuel Delesque** (Traditional Dream Factory) - https://samueldelesque.me/\n- **Sohto** (Earthist & ReFi Turkey) - https://x.com/soht0\n- **Scott Morris** (ReFi DAO) - https://x.com/thetokenjedi\n\nThe power of ReFi Mediterranean lies in its ability to bring together a diverse network of changemakers, each with their own unique expertise, vision, and connection to place. As we deepen our connections across the bioregion, we are cultivating a movement that is not just about solving immediate crises but about creating long-lasting systems of regeneration.\n\n# Our Vision: Uniting for Bioregional Regeneration\n\nReFi Mediterranean seeks to connect and scale the efforts of its local ReFi nodes and aligned projects, building on existing regenerative work to create synergies that enhance collaboration and maximize collective impact across the bioregion. Many of the activities listed below are already in progress within local nodes, and the plan is to coordinate and expand these initiatives to deepen their regenerative impact across the Mediterranean.\n\n### Immediate Focus (Short-Term)\n\n1. **Education, Resource Sharing, and Ecosystem Mapping**: Local nodes are gathering practical resources on ReFi apps, Web3 tools, decentralized governance, and regenerative practices tailored to their specific communities. ReFi Mediterranean will scale these efforts by creating an ecosystem map that highlights ReFi-aligned initiatives across the Mediterranean, connecting local value-driven movements with global tech-enablers. This comprehensive map will serve as a tool for collaboration and broader community education across the bioregion.\n2. **Network Building**: Local nodes are organizing workshops and meetups to foster connections. By coordinating these efforts, ReFi Mediterranean will establish a bioregion-wide network of regenerative projects, strengthening partnerships and facilitating shared learning through conferences and collaborative events.\n3. **Cultural and Spiritual Regeneration**: Local nodes are working to revitalize sacred practices and embed decolonial approaches. ReFi Mediterranean aims to expand these efforts, positioning the Mediterranean as a hub for cultural, spiritual, and agricultural renewal that transcends tourism.\n4. **Storytelling and Amplification**: Many nodes are already capturing and [sharing stories of regeneration.](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146) ReFi Mediterranean will scale this work by developing a cohesive multimedia narrative that amplifies local efforts, engages global audiences, and invites wider participation in regenerative initiatives.\n\n### Building the Foundations (Mid-Term)\n\n1. **Funding and Support**: Participatory mechanisms for fund allocation are already in use by local groups. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale these processes, facilitating transparent and impactful resource distribution to regenerative projects across the bioregion.\n2. **Data Commons and Ecological Monitoring**: Several nodes are developing systems to track ecological health and monitor regenerative progress. ReFi Mediterranean aims to build on this by creating a shared data infrastructure to aggregate and share this information across the region, supporting informed decision-making and collective impact reporting.\n\n### Future Horizon (Long-Term)\n\n1. **Regenerative Marketplace and Investment Fund**: Some local nodes are exploring regenerative markets and revenue-sharing models. ReFi Mediterranean aims to establish an on-chain marketplace where regenerative producers can sell their products, with portions of revenues reinvested into community treasuries to support local regeneration.\n2. **Bioregional Investment Fund**: As funding needs grow, ReFi Mediterranean envisions creating a bioregion-wide investment fund to channel larger investments into critical regenerative infrastructure projects, fostering sustainable growth.\n3. **Policy Innovation Lab**: Some nodes are already engaging with policymakers. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale this by collaborating across the region to pilot innovative governance models that align with bioregional principles, driving systemic change.\n4. **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & BFF**: Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs in the region to develop a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy that can inform the further development of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFF) to support long-term regenerative projects and systemic change across the Mediterranean.\n\nBy coordinating and scaling these activities, ReFi Mediterranean aims to build a connected, resilient bioregional ecosystem. This network not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term pathways to systemic regeneration and renewal. Aligned with the broader Regen Coordination movement, ReFi Mediterranean seeks to develop common infrastructure and alignment across the ecosystem, focusing on the aggregation of impact data from connected organizations. This data will be linked to both local and global funding sources to maximize transparency and effectiveness in resource allocation. As the network expands, ReFi Mediterranean aims to deepen collaboration between local nodes, amplifying shared efforts while building a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Through this process of mapping, knowledge-sharing, and coordinated resource management, ReFi Mediterranean aspires to create the necessary pathways for scaling regenerative finance across the Mediterranean, fostering systemic change throughout the bioregion.\n\n# Our Finances: Innovating Resource Flows\n\nOur approach to finance is as interconnected as the Mediterranean itself. We're pioneering a nested model of resource management that allows for local autonomy while fostering bioregion-wide collaboration.\n\n### Current Financial Ecosystem\n\n1. **Local Node Fundraising**: Each node raises funds independently, often through platforms like Gitcoin & ReFi DAO’s Local Node funding rounds.\n2. **Transparent Distribution**: Funds raised are often redistributed to local projects through open, participatory processes. ReFi Italia has been a leader in this, facilitating collective decision-making on fund allocation. ReFi Barcelona is also experimenting with a Quadratic Funding round for their local network.\n3. **Impact Tracking**: Nodes like RiFai Sicilia and Earthist DAO are using platforms like Bloom Network to write impact reports, earning FLO tokens that can be converted into other cryptocurrencies.\n4. **Yield Generation**: We're learning to manage on-chain treasuries, including strategies for generating yield on idle funds through DeFi protocols.\n\n### Vision for BioFi Resource Management\n\nAs we evolve, we're working towards a more sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem that reimagines where value is placed and how it flows:\n\n1. **Bioregional Treasury**: We're establishing a BioFi Mediterranean multi-sig wallet, with representatives from each local node as signers. This will allow us to manage bioregion-wide resources collectively.\n2. **Nested Governance**: Local nodes will maintain their own treasuries and decision-making processes, nested within the larger bioregional structure. This allows for customized local solutions while enabling coordination on larger initiatives.\n3. **Participatory Allocation**: We're developing mechanisms for participatory budgeting at multiple scales, from local nodes up to the bioregional level.\n4. **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: We're exploring the creation of a Mediterranean regenerative token system that could facilitate value exchange across the bioregion while incentivizing regenerative activities.\n5. **Blended Finance Approaches**: We aim to create pathways for traditional finance to support our work, potentially through mechanisms like green bonds or impact investing vehicles tailored to bioregional regeneration.\n6. **Value Reimagination**: Inspired by models such as the [Eight Forms of Capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf), we're pioneering a shift in how financial value is perceived and allocated. Instead of focusing solely on consumer goods, we're creating mechanisms to direct financial flows towards building regenerative futures, supporting sacred practices, and nurturing love within our communities.\n7. **Cultural Onboarding and Web3 Bridge**: We're developing innovative storytelling approaches to onboard cultural interest in our bioregional regeneration efforts, weaving together ancient Mediterranean mythology with new narratives. We aim to bridge cultural gaps within diverse Mediterranean communities and between traditional and new economies. This includes creating accessible educational materials about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in local languages and dialects, inviting wider participation and financial contributions towards building a thriving future for our bioregion.\n\n# Our Action Plan: A Phased Approach to Transformation\n\nThe ambition of ReFi Mediterranean is far-reaching, with the ultimate goal of accelerating a regenerative transition across the bioregion. However, to manage scope effectively and ensure success, a phased approach has been developed, with clear, achievable actions and milestones to guide progress. Given the potential size of the resources raised from this grant application, the primary focus will be on fulfilling Phase 1 of the action plan. This will lay the foundation for further development, with an intention to initiate collaborations and raise additional funding to support subsequent phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Mapping and Case Study Library\n\n- **Goal**: To establish a comprehensive overview of local nodes and projects within the Mediterranean region.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Map ReFi local nodes and place-based ReFi & Web3 activities across the region.\n    - Create a **Case Study Library** documenting the models and activities being implemented.\n    - Gain insights into the diverse applications of ReFi Web3 technologies and use these insights to inform the next phases of ReFi Mediterranean and other bioregional strategies.\n\n### Phase 2: Bioregional Impact Data Commons\n\n- **Goal**: To create a shared data infrastructure that supports the aggregation of impact data across local nodes and projects.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Develop a **Bioregional Data Commons** to monitor ecological health, track regenerative efforts, and guide decision-making.\n    - In collaboration with **Regen Coordination**, design and implement a collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for the ecosystem of ReFi Mediterranean.\n    - Bring impact data on-chain, ensuring transparency and verifiability through Web3 technologies. This system will enable accurate and reliable reporting from local nodes and projects, fostering coherence, trust, and transparency.\n    - Aggregate this data for alignment with local and global grant sources and technology solutions.\n\nAs ReFi Mediterranean becomes proficient in measuring, aggregating, and reporting its impact, it will attract a broader range of capital beyond Web3 grant funding, diversifying its financing and reinvesting resources into regenerative projects.\n\n### Phase 3: Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)\n\n- **Goal**: To create a comprehesive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and establish a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) to support regenerative initiatives in the Mediterranean.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs and stakeholders, including local governments and NGOs, to develop a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.\n    - Use this strategy as the foundation for launching the first **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** in the Mediterranean, a key resource for scaling regenerative projects.\n    - Establish financial support systems and capital distribution mechanisms to effectively fund ReFi Mediterranean initiatives.\n    - Expand the ReFi Toolkit, knowledge resources, and frameworks for ecosystem-wide adoption.\n\n# Thank you 💚\n\nOnly together can we build a regenerative future, for our bioregion and beyond.

are the founders of Fundación Barichara Regenerativa. Our mission is to regenerate the regional climate system of our territory in the heart of the Northern Andes. This includes three major river systems and a unique ecology like nowhere else on Earth – the “High Andes Tropical Dry Forest” that has been severely damaged in the last 80 years.\n\nOur team is comprised of community leaders who work in one or more of four thematic areas:\n\n1.

Cultural Regeneration and Territorial Healing\n\nA major focus for us is watershed restoration through land-system change. We live in a region that is rapidly becoming a desert after more than 95% of the tropical dry forest was cut down in order to produce monoculture crops, introduce cattle and real estate development. We weave among local initiatives to organize at landscape scales using techniques from permaculture, Syntropic agroforestry, and other domains of relevant knowledge.\n\nWe also gather and convene local producers of food, cosmetics, natural fibers, earthen construction, and related craft skills to create regenerative economic models through an initiative called Casa Común. Barichara is registered as a national heritage site in Colombia for its depths of local cultural craft skills among the descendants of the Indigenous Guane people and local campesinos that go by the name Patiamarillos.\n\nWe believe that regeneration at all the levels mentioned can only be possible if there is a spiritual and emotional healing at the individual and collective level, through the restoration of the human relationships and also through our relation with Planet Earth and all of its earthlings. \n\nIn order to help organize all of this work, we have established our own territorial foundation called Barichara Regenerativa and are in the process of creating four different community-led funding ecosystems. They are a Regenerative Education Fund, Restoring the Rivers Fund, Regenerative Economics Fund, and Territorial Healing Fund. In the last four years, we have mobilized several hundred thousand dollars through various philanthropic relationships and in numerous Gitcoin rounds. The funding has always come into community hands through processes of sociocratic decision-making.\n\nOur focus for the funding that we receive in this BioFi Pathfinders Round is to support the creation of governance structures for watershed restoration while weaving among reforestation efforts that are already underway throughout our territory. This is part of the Restoring the Rivers Fund that has been in a process of gradual formation throughout the last year. It is connected with work that we are doing to create a Geoportal of geographic information systems that connect different educational initiatives and watershed restoration efforts across our territory.\n\nOur team at the foundation has the following founding members:\n\nMariana Atuesta\nJosé Barco\nSergio Barrera\nJoe Brewer\nCamila Encinales\nTannia Falconer\nEmilce González\nManuela Ángel \nMargarita Higuera\nNatalia Ortiz\nMaria Cecilia Restrepo\nIvonne Valencia\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"TanniaFalconer"},"recipient":"0x5c977f6520A5e6D1Ca9C26133d80f2Ce47BF937C"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreie2a5fhmxpyz6hlxgxj7shrws5eyck664f4v44qqxtlm3t7ot4vj4","projects":[{"name":"Barichara Regenerativa","id":"0x7c3e66e03394fc9d5623d203a8f0bc23afb3df238224007dc5a2aeecdfdb62df","metadata":{"title":"Barichara Regenerativa","logoImg":"bafkreiakmqlcvu26hgfopeuaemcgsntjci67wudjfqq7nmsv56agguts3e","website":"https://www.regeneratebarichara.org","bannerImg":"bafybeib5vqugzrxxb4jccp3qfkpgkpr6eixugccexmp2o2yowf3xnbdcua","createdAt":1729290041584,"credentials":{},"description":"We are the founders of Fundación Barichara Regenerativa. Our mission is to regenerate the regional climate system of our territory in the heart of the Northern Andes. This includes three major river systems and a unique ecology like nowhere else on Earth – the “High Andes Tropical Dry Forest” that has been severely damaged in the last 80 years.\n\nOur team is comprised of community leaders who work in one or more of four thematic areas:\n\n1. Regenerative Education\n2. Regeneration of Natural Ecosystems\n3. Regenerative Economy\n4.

**Re/Village Green Valley**\n\nRe/Village works on commons space, shared ritual, and community infrastructure to support a Seven Generations Vision for the Green Valley bioregion of West Sonoma County, CA.\n\n**Introduction to Our Bioregion**\n\nOur bioregion is nestled in the beautiful and ecologically rich landscape of Graton, California, part of West Sonoma County's Green Valley. This area is defined by its rolling hills, vineyards, farmland, and forests. Economically, the region is sustained by agriculture, eco-tourism, and small businesses. Our community of approximately 1,800 residents embodies a diverse cultural mix, with a significant proportion of Latino agricultural workers. The area's culture is shaped by its agricultural roots, a long history of Bay Area progressivism in artists, spiritual and co-living communities and more recently tech, with a growing emphasis on regenerative agroecology and local business development.\n\nWe’ve mapped our bioregion based on both its ecological and social boundaries. The Green Valley watershed, which provides both natural resources and livelihood opportunities, connects the region. Key features such as the West County Regional Trail, the Green Valley Creek, and native habitats further define this area. This collaborative mapping process has emerged from community input, engaging local residents and historians, farmers, and environmental groups to co-create a vision that blends ecological integrity with sustainable economic activities.\n\n### **Collective Challenges and Regeneration Opportunities**\n\nThe primary challenges faced by our bioregion include **environmental** threats like wildfires and drought, which strain the local ecosystem and agricultural activities. **Socially**, there is a divide between the long-term residents and the primarily Latino day laborer community. **Culturally**, the town lacks an energetic heart—central, accessible spaces for residents of all backgrounds to gather, celebrate, and work together on local projects. The town is missing a vibrant hearth and the effects that a common shared space has on weaving people and place together.\n\nIn response to these challenges, we see exciting opportunities for regeneration. The Graton Town Square project is a \"tipping point\" initiative designed to serve as a vibrant hub for ecological restoration, economic development, and cultural exchange. We are implementing principles of permaculture and regenerative design in the Town Square, which will feature rain gardens, native pollinator habitats, and spaces for local markets and events. These efforts not only aim to heal the land but also foster social cohesion and economic resilience through community participation.\n\n### **The Bioregional Organizing Team**\n\nRe/Village Green Valley began in late summer of 2023 with a project to acquire a former gas-station site and rehabilitate the land into a vibrant town square/commons for our small town of Graton. Over this first year, our effort has engaged nearly a thousand community members through our Design Committee, Community Advisory Council, Volunteer Days, Town Hall Meetings, School Field Trips, and our recent “Graton Day: The Green Valley Festival” event.\n\nOur core organizing team consists of facilitators and creatives who are weaving together a network of both formal organizations, such as the Graton Community Services District (GCSD) and the Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District, alongside an informal network of local residents, business owners, and volunteers. As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our collaboration by involving local schools, Indigenous communities, and other regional organizations to foster a regenerative economy that benefits everyone.\n\n### **Indigenous Engagement and Community Voices**\n\nOur initiative recognizes the need for deeper engagement with Indigenous Peoples and their wisdom in shaping our bioregion’s future. We are actively working to strengthen our relationships with the local indigenous community – particularly the Federated Tribes of the Graton Rancheria and Heron’s Shadow Project in our watershed. We hold a deep conviction as a team that we are all “indigenous to somewhere” and thus need to become “more indigenous to ourselves.” This conviction feeds a slowness and patience with building decolonial relationships in a good way, while at the same time holding a deep humbleness and reverence for the place-keepers of these lands where we are settlers.\n\n### **Current Role and Future Vision**\n\nBuilding a town square is a **potent and symbolic starting point** for our bioregional organizing effort. Our organizing over the past year has created a foundational understanding of the relationships, allies, and “story of place” that will seed further regenerative actions. We’ve begun to meet many local leaders, with critical projects ranging from water, land and forest regeneration, to food, housing, and cultural development. **Many initiatives are small, under-resourced, or disconnected and will benefit immensely from the organization and (multiple forms of capital) mobilized by a BFF.** We are particularly excited to start publicly co-creating our Seven Generations Village Visions (starting with the town of Graton) and Green Valley **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.\n\nOur primary financial initiatives so far have been public funding (Sonoma Land Trust, Sonoma County Community Infrastructure Grants, Ag & Open Space Grant) and a community capital campaign. We are in the early stages of designing a number of regenerative finance instruments – including a DAF investment vehicle, a social enterprise development company, and a stewardship trust to hold land, local businesses, and housing assets. The Bioregional Trust and Bioregional Venture Studio models both organically fit into the near-term evolution of the work that wants to happen here!\n\n### **Funding Vision**\n\nThus far, we have supported our work through a combination of public grants, local fundraising efforts, and volunteer contributions. However, we recognize that **more sustainable financial mechanisms are needed to support long-term regenerative initiatives**. Our current funding flows are relatively **fragmented**, and we see this **project as an opportunity to create a more transparent and synergistic financial ecosystem**. By utilizing grants like those from Gitcoin and other sources, we aim to **cohere diverse funding streams** and practice collective governance in resource allocation.\n\nOur vision includes d**eveloping bioregional financing mechanisms that can channel resources toward regenerative projects** in agriculture, education, and community development. We see potential in forming partnerships with regional land trusts, creating cooperative funding models, and exploring revenue-generating activities such as community events and eco-tourism.****\n\nWith Gitcoin funding, we will continue to lean into our **catalytic community events, storytelling initiatives, and development of basic financial infrastructure**. We are grateful for your support in all the ways, and to be part of this larger movement for bioregional resilience.","lastUpdated":0},"recipient":"0xDa9F58f38c16A13a540468b0D97E578EC241709f"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreibey7pgwznptybdhcsbbauspi5msfuakik2h2m3szvmmto3fdsml4","projects":[{"name":"Re/Village Green Valley","id":"0x27d70ec0aa0c6ea1df19743ca576bd05d9d8eaf191bcfd05d398c7ad9d1ab50d","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Re/Village Green Valley","logoImg":"bafkreigmy2mqktun4p6f375vgnykpr4ruh3amwxx22xmxjmzws66enaipe","website":"https://revillage.net","bannerImg":"bafkreifswk632rwtgpehy3rgp377dgujgjdh74c76rqkwplvoucwaxbrze","createdAt":1729638654725,"credentials":{},"description":"# **Re/Village Green Valley**\n\nRe/Village works on commons space, shared ritual, and community infrastructure to support a Seven Generations Vision for the Green Valley bioregion of West Sonoma County, CA.\n\n**Introduction to Our Bioregion**\n\nOur bioregion is nestled in the beautiful and ecologically rich landscape of Graton, California, part of West Sonoma County's Green Valley.

The Bioregional Trust and Bioregional Venture Studio models both organically fit into the near-term evolution of the work that wants to happen here!\n\n### **Funding Vision**\n\nThus far, we have supported our work through a combination of public grants, local fundraising efforts, and volunteer contributions. However, we recognize that **more sustainable financial mechanisms are needed to support long-term regenerative initiatives**. Our current funding flows are relatively **fragmented**, and we see this **project as an opportunity to create a more transparent and synergistic financial ecosystem**. By utilizing grants like those from Gitcoin and other sources, we aim to **cohere diverse funding streams** and practice collective governance in resource allocation.\n\nOur vision includes d**eveloping bioregional financing mechanisms that can channel resources toward regenerative projects** in agriculture, education, and community development. We see potential in forming partnerships with regional land trusts, creating cooperative funding models, and exploring revenue-generating activities such as community events and eco-tourism.****\n\nWith Gitcoin funding, we will continue to lean into our **catalytic community events, storytelling initiatives, and development of basic financial infrastructure**. We are grateful for your support in all the ways, and to be part of this larger movement for bioregional resilience.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{}},"metadataCid":"bafkreicu6ttnh72rbq543ha4fz5xlsl7io7cwhxakx4shulbzul3jd5m6a","timestamp":"2024-10-22T23:11:07+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xDa9F58f38c16A13a540468b0D97E578EC241709f","createdAtBlock":28393274}],"projectId":"0x27d70ec0aa0c6ea1df19743ca576bd05d9d8eaf191bcfd05d398c7ad9d1ab50d","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"18","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-10-22T23:36:17.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"28393576"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2024-10-22T23:37:37.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"28393592"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":28440451,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-10-22T23:36:17+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":325.51611,"totalDonationsCount":60,"uniqueDonorsCount":52},{"anchorAddress":"0xaeef9aF491bB144067e9Dad25E063501B713F218","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":28629257,"createdByAddress":"0x70609D1aAd19353566e4836c8310523925a4D009","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"20","metadata":{"signature":"0xe07a70a5b9ec26003b3b83304f200c76f4c323cc04e9354e5eb53b427da502fe5df98406821e5b5d38a2ee649cb9a8e4dab736d2eb44af82260f7549372a683f1b","application":{"round":"0x9a8df486d919d132253228b8bbcb1db419bc4d98","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"cIeWYPosoBnoh7fYsvgjyKdFy1TziDIkkoOg3oBBYulZj5XLZskiNEyx36o9x81myqTbaUxscT35KsKdITpFXA==","encryptedSymmetricKey":"a4b47bd9c2ec2ee0b70c640cdd6bed6a1a8b21b7b56e29b38ebff49d728705b27b81a72ed9aa5c3717effc31d9176f0ce5c34701de1c31dbe499479c408111d0a1c0d545b7e5fb54dd0979d92f49224bee07523f9bb9a264cf339960a810b884104ac9142c35ccbb16724aba0bd4b5770f51cccf28ceba2751801404a21874a900000000000000207894d975795b8974a0fbc69386c01835ac94f2e66c2c14161dec6f712d559b8445ffa09a176635e508b6295255f579a9"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Token Pre-sale","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"17","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"66,264 USD","hidden":false,"question":"Total Prior Funding","questionId":3},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Jan 2024","hidden":false,"question":"Date Of Project Creation","questionId":4},{"type":"dropdown","answer":"Power User","hidden":false,"question":"Experience In Web3","questionId":5},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"$1,863,242 USD","hidden":false,"question":"Annual Operating Budget","questionId":6}],"project":{"id":"0xa8bc408534b986d96e13f5cc55a92b3272e9f8e89353f6e1789a18971f38ec9a","title":"Jaguar Bio-cultural Tokens","logoImg":"bafkreidcs47vittkcr3u7bd5rkxkz6jdwcatjqs5jc6utkvbgnwf2iep74","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreid7g3e5ysfcsxjybgvc63hb3caswooxu2yrgjnavt4t5s5lafgjky","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://app.regen.network/project/sharamentsa-pilot","bannerImg":"bafkreidy2y5spbb66rzgl6tliyh54l3r62g4mzltveel4bizhngcc76w3u","createdAt":1730817388680,"credentials":{},"description":"# Jaguar Bio-cultural Tokens: Indigenous-Led Regeneration in the Amazon Bioregion of Ecuador and Perú\n\n## Executive Summary\nIndigenous communities in an Amazon bioregion of Ecuador and Peru are pioneering innovative solutions to preserve their ancestral lands.
