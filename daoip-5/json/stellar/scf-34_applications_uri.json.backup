            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Project:  \nLogistech is a trusted payment processor for cruises, hotels, hostels, and tour companies. By integrating Stellar blockchain technology, it will provide guests with a fast, secure, and cost-effective way to pay.  \n\nSubmission:  \nLogistech, integrated with the Beans Merchant SDK, allows our Merchants’ Guests to pay transactions with Lumens XLM, USDC and other top cryptocurrencies at very low fees compared to traditional payment processors.  \n\nProducts & Services:  \nLogistech is a fully integrated, modular hospitality platform designed to optimize operations for hostels, cruises, resorts and hotels. Our suite of applications enables businesses to manage guests efficiently, process payments seamlessly, and enhance the overall customer experience.  \n\nOur ecosystem includes:\n\n-   Guest Management App – Streamlines check-ins, guest tracking, and account management.  \n    \n-   Tour Management App – Handles tour bookings, itineraries, and sales .  \n    \n-   Cashless Point of Sales (POS) – Allows guests to make purchases using NFC cards or wearables, eliminating cash handling and improving transaction efficiency.  \n    \n-   Website (Beta) – Offers direct bookings, guest account access, and operational integrations.  \n    \n\n##### How Logistech Works:\n\nGuests use NFC wristbands or cards to make purchases during their stay, which are then settled at check-out via traditional payment methods. While this system is already frictionless, the integration of Stellar through Beans Wallet will further reduce transaction fees and enhance accessibility for international guests.  \n\nBy leveraging Beans Merchant SDK, we aim to:  \n\n1.  Enable QR-based check-outs, allowing guests to settle their bills using Stellar while merchants receive USDC.\n    \n1.  Reduce high transaction fees typically associated with international payments.\n    \n1.  Maintain the familiar guest experience while introducing a lower-cost, crypto-powered alternative.",
            "stellar.successCriteria": "We define our success in terms of delivering seamless Stellar-based payments to the tourism industry by integrating a robust, user-friendly Beans Wallet solution into Logistech’s ecosystem. The features we develop provide real-world usability for tour operators, guests, and hospitality businesses.\n\nOur success is measured by how effectively Beans Wallet is integrated into the daily operations of tourism businesses, ensuring that Stellar-based payments enhance efficiency, reduce friction, and provide a modern, secure payment method for travelers.\n\n1.  Industry-Specific Usability\n    \n    -   Our system must enable tour operators, hotels, and merchants in the tourism industry to accept and process Stellar-based payments effortlessly.\n        \n    -   Beans Wallet must function across various transaction types, including bookings, POS payments, and guest wallet top-ups.\n        \n1.  Reliability & Seamless Transactions\n    \n    -   Payments should be processed in real-time with automatic status updates.\n        \n    -   Webhook integrations must ensure accurate tracking of transactions, refunds, and settlements.\n        \n    -   Offline withdrawal functionality should allow continued operations even in low-connectivity environments.\n        \n1.  Merchant & Guest Experience\n    \n    -   The UI/UX must be intuitive, ensuring a frictionless experience for businesses and travelers using Beans Wallet.\n        \n    -   Automated invoicing, reporting, and payment confirmations should reduce manual workload for merchants.\n        \n1.  Scalability & Integration Readiness\n    \n    -   The solution must be fully integrated into Logistech’s POS and tour management system, making Stellar payments a native part of tourism operations.\n        \n    -   The reporting tools must provide clear financial insights for businesses managing cryptocurrency transactions.\n        \n\nBy successfully implementing these features, Logistech will pioneer Stellar payments in the tourism industry, ensuring a practical and scalable solution for global adoption.",
            "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "Logistech is an established hospitality technology provider that already powers hotels, hostels, and tour operators with operational software and POS systems. Our goal with Beans Wallet integration is to offer Stellar-based payments as a seamless payment alternative, leveraging our existing customer base.\n\nOur approach ensures that businesses already using Logistech's ecosystem can immediately process Stellar transactions without additional onboarding friction.\n\nMerchant & Business Adoption Strategy\n\n1.  Direct Integration for Existing Users\n    \n    -   Logistech POS and tour management systems will automatically include Beans Wallet functionality in a software update, requiring no additional setup from businesses.\n        \n    -   Existing merchants, hotels, and tour operators will be able to start accepting Stellar-based payments with their current booking and sales workflows.\n        \n    -   Our customers will gain access to lower-cost transactions while maintaining familiar payment processes.\n        \n1.  Seamless Payment Experience for Guests\n    \n    -   Guests using Logistech-powered accommodations and tours can pay directly with Beans Wallet, just like any other payment method.\n        \n    -   No changes to guest booking flows—Stellar transactions are embedded into the existing checkout and POS process.\n        \n    -   The guest wallet functionality allows direct top-ups and payments, ensuring full usability across hospitality services.\n        \n1.  Automated Reporting & Transaction Management\n    \n    -   Integrated financial reports will provide businesses with real-time insights into Stellar-based transactions.\n        \n    -   Businesses can filter transactions by payment method, enabling seamless financial tracking.\n        \n    -   Automated invoicing and reconciliation ensure smooth accounting processes for hospitality operators.\n        \n\nIndustry Positioning & Scaling\n\n-   Hospitality-Centric Focus: Unlike generic crypto payment solutions, Logistech's integration is tailor-made for tourism businesses, ensuring industry-specific functionality.\n    \n-   No Additional Hardware or Training Required: Businesses can process Stellar transactions immediately, with no additional onboarding burden.\n    \n-   Scalability Without External Marketing: Adoption is entirely organic within Logistech’s existing user base, meaning expansion happens naturally as new hospitality businesses join the platform.\n    \n\nBy embedding Stellar transactions directly into tourism industry operations, Logistech will ensure practical, scalable adoption of blockchain payments without relying on external marketing efforts.",
            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Logistech has firmly established itself as a market leader in Vietnam’s hospitality sector, demonstrating strong product-market fit through widespread adoption:  \n\n-   700k+ guests managed across hostels, hotels, and cruises.  \n    \n-   $30M+ in transactional volume processed through our POS and management systems.  \n    \n-   Seamless NFC-based payments via guest wristbands and wearables.  \n      \n    \n\nCurrently, guests settle their bills at check-out using traditional payment methods, which often come with high transaction fees, particularly for international travelers. Stellar integration via Beans Wallet will provide a low-cost, real-time, and borderless alternative, directly reducing these costs.  \n\nWhy Stellar?\n\n-   Lower Fees – Guests will experience significantly lower transaction costs compared to credit cards and bank transfers.\n    \n-   Frictionless Adoption – Since guests already use RFID wristbands for purchases, they can simply fund their Stellar wallet before check-out with minimal effort.\n    \n-   Enhanced Accessibility – Payments can be made instantly via QR code, with businesses receiving USDC for financial stability.  \n    \n\nThis first-of-its-kind integration will extend crypto-powered check-outs to the hospitality industry, making transactions more affordable, efficient, and accessible for global travelers.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Product\n\nLoto Punto is a kiosk for payments and payouts. It works as a gateway for 12 thousand financial services in banking, utility bills, cell phone top ups and digital wallets. Our system is integrated with Digital Identity and Open Banking services using AI, automating physical payments with high standards of security and fraud prevention.\n\nHow Loto Punto works with Stellar\n\nLoto Punto kiosks enable easy and affordable self-service transactions in local currency within seconds, providing a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to pay, send and receive money. By integrating Stellar Blockchain with Loto Punto’s micro- service-oriented architecture system, we'll offer a more convenient an inexpensive channel for cross border remittances. This is achieved by converting physical FIAT currency into stable cryptocurrency and vice versa, partnering with relevant Stellar Wallets that provide on-ramp and off-ramp services in each LATAM country. For this matter, we have already an alliance with \"Meru Wallet\", that is integrated with Moneygram.\n\nIn the scope of this current project, we'll leverage our existing capabilities, installed capacity and knowledge of cryptoassets transactions, to On-Ramp fiat to crypto in the Stellar network, enabling fund transfers to Stellar accounts of end users. This new functionality will allow end users (senders) to make cost-effective remittances by converting FIAT currency deposited at Loto Punto kiosks into crypto accounts on the Stellar Network. Recipients can redeem their stablecoin digitally or at chosen Stellar anchor physical locations.\n\nBenefits\n\nLoto Punto offers a streamlined approach to financial services. Our kiosks are installed totally free in various points of sale with loyal customers such as convenient stores, drugstores and gas stations. Unlike traditional payment networks that rely on human agents, Loto Punto operates as an automated version, resulting in 50% lower operating costs. By eliminating the need for human sales agents and fixed space leasing costs,Loto Punto efficiently serves up to 40 locations with just one employee. This not only relieves point-of-sale staff from cash management operations and customer service but also provides a clear cost advantage over competitors that require a human interface for end-user transactions\n\nIn aggregate, by integrating Stellar and its Anchors, Loto Punto will serve as a convenient one-stop shop for unbanked users in LATAM.",
            "stellar.successCriteria": "The successful installation and integration of three Loto Punto kiosks in independent local drugstores will result in key outputs, including seamless functionality of self-service remittance transactions, high customer satisfaction, and increased usage by an aproximate of 2500 venezuelan migrants. These outputs will have significant impacts, such as providing unbanked individuals with easy access to low-cost remittance services, boosting the financial inclusion of Venezuelan migrants and enhancing the overall customer experience in the drugstores. Additionally, the project will demonstrate the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Loto Punto kiosks, potentially driving further adoption and scalability in additional locations.\n\nFor Stellar Corporation, this initiative will showcase the practical application of Stellar Blockchain technology in real-world financial services, increasing brand recognition and fostering trust in its blockchain solutions. The project will also expand Stellar’s user base and transactional volume in LATAM, contributing to the broader adoption of Stellar’s ecosystem.",

            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Our community currency system has proven its impact through a transformative pilot in the Los Pajaritos neighborhood of Seville, running since June 2021. During this pilot, over 4,500 transactions were completed, enabling the purchase of fresh food worth $23,000 USD from local merchants, which directly supported underprivileged families and revitalized the local economy.\n\nIn recognition of this success, Comunitaria has earned prestigious accolades, including the UNICEF “Disruptive Social Impact Projects” Award, Blockchain for Humanity Winner, innovation grants from Blockis.eu, NGI Ledger, and BlockStart, European Climate Action’s “Clean Cities” Recognition, and the Spanish Government’s “Break the Poverty Circle” Award.\n\nBeyond this proof of concept, we have garnered critical endorsements and commitments that underscore our readiness for broader deployment. Endorsement letters from UNICEF and other respected organizations are available for review (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-38ZHD5ZH8d36zYf-G1j2BFFuE7JuoXx/view?usp=sharing), and an endorsement video from our strategic partner, Caritas Internationalis—a global network operating in over 162 countries—further validates our model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vps7D4T9EGLHuxjV2NZLWVsOGNd7Wcdm/view?usp=sharing). Caritas is actively engaging with us to scale the initiative, and we have initiated discussions with additional municipalities and NGOs to launch new pilot programs in San Cristóbal, Madrid, and other underprivileged neighborhoods.\n\nOur previous transaction history is publicly available for review:  \n• Comunitaria Transactions: [https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x01355CDdF44EAf901E6EaeD10b27eB1e862Cb72C  \n•](https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x01355CDdF44EAf901E6EaeD10b27eB1e862Cb72C%EF%BF%BC%E2%80%A2) Previous Transactions (Token Renamed): https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x34E11ABE8347856c0fac7547B38885a4F2BE3A32\n\nWe have discontinued the use of Fuse due to its PoS model favoring larger stakeholders and have fully migrated to Stellar—whose trusted nodes offer a fairer, more robust, and production-ready platform. In addition, we plan to integrate the Stellar Disbursement Platform to facilitate stablecoin transactions, enabling enhanced cross-border disbursements, rapid disaster response, and improved liquidity.\n\nOur work has also attracted widespread media coverage, including features on Spanish National Television (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl4BK01KVAo), the best Spanish \"social impact\" podcast (https://youtu.be/cImSV0UOgdk?si=HD-eF-CCcReUXBIM), and regional television news (news1: https://youtu.be/D_EvXo3MWDQ; news 2: https://youtu.be/_CEN2o12s3k). Furthermore, we have established robust user feedback loops—via regular discovery interviews, beta program sign-ups, and detailed transaction analytics—to continuously refine our solution as we scale.\n\nTogether, these achievements, endorsements, and external commitments provide compelling evidence of our system’s efficacy, technical readiness, and broad appeal, positioning us for rapid and sustainable deployment beyond the successful Los Pajaritos pilot.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Web3 and AI demand for storage is rising, yet centralized cloud storage solutions dominate the market, driving up costs in a fragmented market. DePIN solutions like Filecoin and Arweave fall short, serving primarily archival needs with slow performance and limited incentives for storage providers. This forces businesses to rely on centralized providers due to the lack of seamless integration for decentralized storage.\n\nFlashback is the first agentic AI cloud diversification platform, enabling companies to diversify data across both centralized and decentralized cloud storage providers. It offers services such as credential account management, API orchestration, multi-cloud accessibility (AWS, GCP, Filecoin, StorJ), migration and interoperability, and AI-driven cost optimization and resource allocation.\n\nOne key layer of the platform is Flashback's own storage infrastructure network (DePIN), designed for Web3 businesses needing enhanced privacy, governance, and fast data retrieval. Built jointly with the Stellar Development Foundation, we have built a prototype leveraging Soroban smart contracts for service-level agreements (SLAs) and quality-of-service (QoS) evaluation. This prototype has shown reliable performances and has been approved by the SDF.\n\nWith support from the Stellar Community Fund, we aim to advance R&D on Stellar to develop a decentralized multi-cloud platform that integrates Flashback's DePIN and additional storage providers by developing the following features:\n\nFeature 1: Storage Provision Management\n\nFlashback connects storage infrastructure providers with equipment or cloud storage capacities with the platform's consumers (users and services).  \nIn this first feature, storage infrastructure providers can register and manage storage capacities across geographical regions, design SLAs, and monetize their infrastructure designed by the function of the smart contract and the platform. Providers from multiple cloud providers (centralized and decentralized) can register, add storage units with specific capacity, and manage their status (e.g. Available, Maintenance, Decommissioning). Stellar's built-in account and transaction systems ensure secure provider registration and operation tracking.\n\nFeature 2: User Allocation\n\nUsers who are developers of services using the platform can allocate and manage their storage usage in their reservation space. The platform will gather information from the smart contracts, such as costs and Quality of Services of the storage infrastructure providers, the tracking of their reservation consumption, and the history. In the long term, the consumers will incentivize the storage infrastructure providers for high performance and be able to migrate easily the data and its processes across the different cloud protocols.\n\nFeature 3: Unit Storage States\n\nThe provision from the storage infrastructure providers is segmented into unit storage. Unit storage can be reserved by one or multiple consumers. This feature of the smart contract abstracted by the platform allows storage to be tracked as unit states, including different states such as available, reserved, in-use, maintenance, and decommissioning to guarantee the storage infrastructure provider controls its operation and quality-of-services.\n\nFeature 4: Metric System\n\nThe metric system is crucial for monitoring the performances of consumers and storage infrastructure providers. Flashback must ensure the drawbacks of existing DePin technologies, which are too slow, can be solved with the network of storage infrastructure providers in Flashback. The metric system encoded in the smart contract and abstracted by the Flashback platform will collect real-time tracking of capacity, usage, and performance metrics of the storage infrastructure providers, but also consumers to drive fast data retrieval for instance.\n\nFeature 5: Security and Ownership Module\n\nFlashback is a platform that must fit with the compliance rules in different countries. We implement strict validation, caller authentication, and owner-specific operations. We leverage Stellar’s robust authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and enforce contract rules to strengthen security and trust in decentralized storage management.\n\nFeature 6: Frontend Libraries/APIs\n\nA good service application can not exist without a good user interface. Flashback offers modular tools to interface with popular Stellar wallets and the Soroban smart contract, enabling developers to integrate Stellar blockchain interactions seamlessly into their applications. Simply, this feature enables the development for third-party applications, expands Stellar’s ecosystem reach, and enhances accessibility for developers building on the platform.\n\nFeature 7: Engine Room Dashboard\n\nConsumers and storage infrastructure providers can track their performance with a dashboard for statistics visualization and interaction emulation for providers and consumers on the testnet. We integrate with Stellar’s testnet to simulate blockchain interactions and provide real-time metrics for data and transaction visualization. We enable operational insights and testing capabilities for developers and stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions and a smoother transition to mainnet deployment.\n\nBy developing these features, we want to guarantee the Flashback’s DePIN service will empower businesses to have a comfortable and user-friendly granularity of decentralized storage. Leveraging Stellar’s robust smart contracts and authentication mechanisms, this service guarantees secure, compliant, and scalable operations for the modern Web3 ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to unlock unprecedented control and flexibility for developers, enabling them to drive innovation and achieve a competitive edge in a fragmented cloud market. We want to make Stellar technologies the backbone of our platform to bring more decentralization in the Cloud uses.",

This will allow users, developers, and product teams to filter and monitor inflows, outflows, bridge routes, and counterparty chains, offering deeper transparency into cross-chain asset movement.\n\nWith this integration, users will gain instant visibility into cross-chain liquidity flows, helping them track bridged assets, analyze cross-chain transactions, and detect anomalies or unusual activity. Builders and product teams can evaluate user behavior trends, optimize liquidity strategies, and respond to shifting market conditions more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, all data from this integration will be accessible via the Range API, enabling developers to build custom dashboards, risk monitoring tools, and analytics solutions tailored to their needs. This ensures that projects in the Stellar ecosystem can seamlessly integrate cross-chain intelligence into their applications, improving decision-making and security across the network.\n\nLearn more about the benefits of the Cross-Chain Explorer and how developers can leverage this data for advanced tracking, compliance, and asset security.\n\n#2: Stellar Bridge Explorer\n\nRange will develop a dedicated public Stellar Bridge Explorer to provide a real-time view of asset transfers to and from Stellar over Allbridge, Axelar, and Tricorn (and other upcoming interoperability protocols). \n\nWhile the Cross-Chain Explorer integration above will display Stellar-related transactions in our full explorer for every ecosystem, allowing for cross-ecosystem awareness, this bridge explorer will be specific to Stellar only. It will include relevant cross-chain analytics such as inflows and outflows, key addresses, and volume metrics. See https://ibc.range.org/ibc/flows for reference.\n\nThe Stellar Bridge Explorer (to be hosted at stellar.range.org) will be similar to usdc.range.org, which tracks USDC transfers across Circle’s CCTP, relied on by the team at dYdX, Circle and others for their day-to-day operations.\n\n#3: Advanced Trail Intelligence for Stellar\n\nWe will integrate Stellar into Range’s Trail platform - our leading cross-chain risk, intelligence, and investigation tool. Our platform was instrumental in multiple hack investigations this past year, supporting companies such as Circle, Solana Foundation, and Neutron.\n\nRange Trail will track Stellar wallets’ transaction flows across chains and ecosystems. It will enable transaction flow analysis, user profiling, and cross-chain activity tracking. Teams can visualize asset movements through interactive graphs and address cluster views, making it easier to analyze user behavior, detect suspicious activity, and identify high-risk counterparties This integration streamlines risk management and compliance processes, empowering teams to monitor assets and transactions across ecosystems.\n\nIn the event of a security incident, Range Trail will enable detailed forensic investigations, tracking stolen or compromised assets in real-time across multiple ecosystems. This capability will help teams pinpoint where funds have been moved and how they are being distributed and provide critical intelligence for recovery efforts.\n\nIntegrating Stellar into Range Trail empowers ecosystem teams, security researchers, and compliance officers with a powerful toolset for risk management, asset monitoring, and real-time blockchain forensics.\n\n#4: 6 months of Comprehensive Post Delivery ServiceAdvanced\n\nOnce we have completed the development and launch of the 3 products mentioned above, as part of this proposal, we will deliver six months of our comprehensive Post Delivery Service, which includes: \n\n-   Maintenance to ensure compatibility with chain upgrades.\n    \n-   Updates to our parsers and processing to accommodate new types of onchain transactions and feature developments.\n    \n-   Additions or tweaks to the analytics and dashboards we produce to better align with common queries by ecosystem partners.\n    \n-   Exposing any such new metrics to all our API endpoints used by teams in Stellar.\n    \n-   Add new cross-ecosystem interoperability protocols as they onboard Stellar to their protocols.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "NebulaVRF is a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for Soroban, providing secure, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable randomness for decentralized applications. It eliminates reliance on centralized randomness sources, ensuring tamper-proof and trustless randomness.\n\nEnsuring pure randomness is critical in decentralized systems because predictable randomness leads to manipulation and exploits. A well-known issue is the last-mover attack (vector bias), where the final participant in a randomness-based event—such as a lottery or validator selection—can delay or withhold their commitment until they see a favorable outcome. This exploit allows malicious actors to influence supposedly fair processes by selectively participating only when the randomness favors them. Without a cryptographic guarantee, many existing blockchain randomness implementations remain vulnerable to such attacks, making them unsuitable for high-stakes applications like DeFi, governance, gaming, and secure voting.\n\nOur current (tentative) approach being the VRF is, the VRF function generates randomness by taking a seed (optional, BytesN) for user-provided entropy, block metadata (BytesN) including block hash and timestamp for unpredictability, and a public identifier (String) like a user address or contract call ID to differentiate requests. The function outputs a 32-byte cryptographically generated random value along with a 64-byte verifiable proof, ensuring the randomness is tamper-proof and can be validated later.\n\nDevelopers can integrate NebulaVRF in three ways:\n\n1.  On-Chain Soroban Contract – For fully trustless and verifiable randomness, ideal for DeFi, DAO governance, and NFT trait assignment.\n    \n1.  Fast API Endpoint – For low-latency randomness, useful in gaming, real-time lotteries, and airdrops, with optional on-chain proof verification.\n    \n1.  Rust-Based SDK (Cargo Package) – For backend applications needing secure randomness without blockchain overhead, such as AI models, or Web3 marketplaces.\n    \n\nUse Cases\n\n-   Gaming & Lotteries – Fair dice rolls, loot box rewards, randomized game mechanics.\n    \n-   NFTs & Metaverse – Randomized trait distribution, rarity assignment.\n    \n-   DeFi & Airdrops – Random token distributions, fair reward allocation.\n    \n-   DAO Governance – Unbiased committee selection, randomized voting mechanics.",

A successful outcome includes at least 10+ projects integrating NebulaVRF for use cases in DeFi, gaming, DAOs, and NFTs. The VRF contract will be live on Stellar Mainnet, providing trustless randomness while maintaining high uptime and low-cost execution. The API should process 1,000+ monthly requests, and the Rust SDK should be actively used in backend applications. Developer engagement will be measured through GitHub activity, contributions, and discord discussions. Long-term success includes establishing NebulaVRF as the go-to randomness solution for anyone building in Soroban or Stellar.",

Launch Strategy\n\nPhase 1: Developer Beta (Testnet) – Month 1-2\n\n-   Deploy Soroban Testnet Contract & launch NebulaVRF API.\n    \n-   Release Rust SDK (Cargo) for backend integration.\n    \n-   Conduct developer outreach via Stellar forums, twitter & Discord.  \n    \n\nPhase 2: Mainnet Release – Month 3-4\n\n-   Deploy VRF contract on Soroban Mainnet.\n    \n-   Provide developer documentation + GitHub repo.\n    \n-   Offer bounties for early adopters.  \n    \n\nPhase 3: Adoption & Growth – Month 5+\n\n-   Host hackathons & developer tutorials on youtube.\n    \n-   Secure integrations with major Soroban projects.\n    \n-   Promote through twitter, discord & ecosystem channels.",
            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "NebulaVRF is in the idea and technical design phase, aiming to build a native on-chain randomness beacon for Soroban. While not yet launched, most major blockchains have built-in VRF, which Stellar currently lacks. Ethereum uses Chainlink VRF, Polkadot has BABE-based randomness, and Solana integrates an oracle-assisted VRF. Without a trustless randomness source, Soroban developers must rely on off-chain randomness, centralized oracles, or block metadata, all of which introduce security risks and manipulation vectors.\n\nCurrent Alternatives & Their Limitations\n\n1.  Off-Chain Randomness – Manipulatable and unverifiable.\n    \n1.  External Oracles – Requires trust in third-party providers (e.g., Chainlink, not available on Soroban).\n    \n1.  Manual Entropy (Block Hashes, Timestamps) – Predictable and vulnerable to manipulation.\n    \n\nWhy NebulaVRF is Better\n\n1.  Fully On-Chain & Trustless – Eliminates reliance on oracles.\n    \n1.  Low-Cost & Efficient – No extra transaction fees like Chainlink VRF.\n    \n1.  Flexible Integration – Supports on-chain contract calls, API access, and an SDK for backend randomness.\n    \n1.  Secure & Manipulation-Resistant – Uses commit-reveal and threshold cryptography to prevent last-mover bias.\n    \n\nOur initial outreach to Stellar developers confirms demand for a VRF solution, enabling secure, verifiable randomness for DeFi, gaming, and governance applications.

The budget provided is not used for auditing services, but it’s rather reserved for the work needed to pass the audits (e.g. fixes to code and possible changes to contract logic).\n        \n    -   Completion will be measured by conducting pre-audit security reviews and internal testing before submitting the smart contracts for a professional third-party audit. Any issues identified during the audit will be addressed, tested, and validated to ensure they have been resolved. A final audit report will confirm that critical and high-risk vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "As discussed with the Stellar team, the network has identified a strong need for a lending protocol with a looping feature to diversify and expand its DeFi ecosystem. JLending will add value for Stellar by introducing additional utilization for XLM tokens and creating new yield opportunities for liquidity providers, including the holders of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). Given that leveraged yield strategies currently secure substantial TVL on other blockchains—nearly $28B on Ethereum and about $2.5B on Solana (according to defillama.com)—it’s evident that an efficient, low-cost lending protocol could significantly benefit Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem.  \n  \nOur team’s extensive experience in decentralized finance makes us well-positioned to build JLending. Our most prominent projects on Solana include:  \n* JPool: a liquid staking platform offering flexible staking options and a suite of powerful tools, with a TVL of ~1M SOL and a community of 30K+ users. Link: https://jpool.one/  \n* Smart Validator Toolkit (SVT): an all-in-one validator cockpit that automates the processes of bootstrapping and maintaining Solana nodes. SVT is designed for users—both crypto newbies and pros—who wish to be relieved of tedious bootstrapping and maintenance when running a node on the Solana network.
