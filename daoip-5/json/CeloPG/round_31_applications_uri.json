With a proven track record of training 1,213 farmers, planting 45,000+ fruit trees, and restoring 10 wetlands, we seek funding to scale our impact through a larger training center and expanded restoration efforts. The project addresses critical environmental challenges while building climate resilience for low-income communities\n\nOur environmental restoration work benefits everyone in the region regardless of their participation. Restored wetlands and forests provide ecosystem services (water filtration, flood control, carbon sequestration) that are freely available to all community members.\nOur climate change education and awareness campaigns are openly accessible to all community members, with no restrictions on who can benefit from the knowledge.\nThe fruit trees we plant in schools and health centers provide benefits (shade, fruit, improved air quality) to anyone who visits these public spaces.\n\nThe environmental benefits from restored wetlands and forests don't diminish when more people benefit from them. Clean air, water filtration, and carbon sequestration serve everyone simultaneously without reduction in quality.\nThe knowledge we share through our training programs can be used by any number of farmers without reducing its value to others.\nThe climate resilience infrastructure we build benefits the entire community without diminishing its value for any individual\n\nWHY\nUganda loses approximately 200,000 hectares of forest annually, creating an urgent need to scale up our restoration efforts.\nOur current training space is too small to meet growing community demand for regenerative agriculture training.\nClimate change impacts are intensifying in Eastern Uganda, requiring immediate action to build community resilience.\nThe project has proven successful with 1,213 farmers trained and 45,000+ trees planted, demonstrating readiness to scale.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPlant 1 million native trees by 2027\nRehabilitate 100 hectares of wetlands\nIncrease forest cover and enhance biodiversity\nImprove natural water filtration systems\n\nCommunity Impact:\nTrain 5,000+ additional rural farmers in regenerative agriculture\nExpand skills training for women and girls (tailoring, hairdressing)\nPlant fruit trees in 200 new schools, health centers & churches\nReach 80% of local population with environmental conservation awareness\n\nClimate Resilience:\nEnhanced community adaptation to climate change\nImproved agricultural productivity through sustainable methods\nIncreased food security through diversified farming practices\n\nQuarterly Progress Reports:\nNumber of trees planted and survival rates\nHectares of wetlands restored\nNumber of farmers trained\nSkills training participation rates\n\nImpact Measurement:\nEcological assessments of restored areas\nCommunity surveys on awareness and adoption of sustainable practices\nDocumentation of improved agricultural yields\nPhoto and video documentation of restoration progress\nCommunity Engagement:\nRegular community feedback sessions\nParticipatory monitoring of restoration sites\nSuccess story documentation\nSocial media updates and progress sharing\n\nObjective 1\n\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\n\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\n\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\n\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\n\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n\nObjective 2\n\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\n\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n\nObjective 3\n\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\n\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n\nObjective 4\n\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\n\nYour support will enable AYOWECCA UGANDA to scale our proven model of environmental restoration and community development, creating lasting public goods that benefit both current and future generations in Eastern Uganda."

Blockchain technology offers exceptional benefits for certification solutions, such as:\n\ntransparency, since all records are visible to authorized parties, which increases trust;\n\nsecurity, since data is encrypted and virtually immutable, which reduces the risk of fraud;\n\ndecentralization, since there is no need for a central authority, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency;\n\nand traceability, which facilitates the monitoring of the complete history of a certification.\n\nBy harnessing the potential of Blockchain technologies as a whole, we intend to create a certification ecosystem combined with decentralized (DeFi) and regenerative (ReFi) finance, which not only endorses the practices of our clients and partners, but also contributes to practices of democratizing learning through digital means, digital inclusion in cutting-edge technologies, financial inclusion and sustainable development.\n\nIn addition to Blockchain technology, E.co-lab will be based on Participatory Guarantee Systems (SPG), characterized by Social Control and Joint Responsibility, which enables the generation of credibility appropriate to different social, cultural, political, institutional, organizational and economic realities. Social Control is a process of generating credibility, necessarily recognized by society, organized by a group of clients and partners who work with commitment and seriousness. It is established by the direct participation of its members in collective actions to assess the compliance of the practices to be certified with the technical regulations. Joint Responsibility occurs when all group members commit to complying with the technical requirements of the practices to be certified and are jointly responsible in cases of non-compliance by some of its members.\n\nE-co.lab also aims to promote and strengthen R&D&I for sustainable products and services, with the inclusion and initial motivation of customers and partners in the consumer markets that its products and services are prepared to reach. Some of the customers and partners, mostly not included in the solutions currently available, include recyclers, seed collectors, ecotourism guides, agroecological farmers, permaculturists, herbalists, traditional midwives, therapists of integrative and complementary health practices (PICS), animal rights activists, among others.\n\n1.a.

It took a lot longer than expected (there are surprisingly few providers in the space for our scale). It's a 50k\u20ac investment (out of which we have funded 15k\u20ac  so far from Gitcoin). \nThis particular machine goes into production in Jan 2026, so we aim to be ready to deploy it when it's ready - hence a delay on the initially scope milestones. This machine will not only help us build up our soil, increase water retention & microbial life - it will also produce about 50kw of heat that we can use in our coliving building under development (450m2), making it a carbon negative heating solution.\n\nIn the meantime, we have continued development of the lands, building more water retention infrastructure (we stored 1000m3 so far this year), we are building a mushroom farm (target to go into production this summer), and we are now looking into also adding a spirulina farm.\n"

Participants include a futures-trained art professor, an artist that experiments with biofabricated textiles and sustainable fashion, a researcher writing on the future of nation-states and economies, and a mindfulness retreat practitioner.. Through this gathering, we will create different speculative design frameworks and artifacts, including contemplating regenerative spatial governance, the physicality of an aging rural site and its surrounding ecology.\n\n- Engage the community with public workshops on regenerative materials and traditional craft including bamboo-based design and bio-yarn & biodegradable prototyping\n\n- Facilitate a group build constructing a teahouse built entirely from wood donated by a local farmer, and led by a craftsman trained on Japanese wooden joinery techniques\n\n- Expand community stewardship of abandoned land and properties: Support and document the stewardship of additional akiya (abandoned) homes, adding to our current network of 5 properties in our core neighborhood (Komoro, Nagano), and 5 \u201csister akiyas\u201d in satellite regions: Fukuoka, Osaka, Okayama, and other parts of Nagano. We aim to assist new stewards in home acquisition, local integration, and responsible renovation.\n\n- Create an educational art installation: Create a site-specific, community-built installation focused on regenerative uses of land and materials, preservation of artifacts, and rural storytelling through spatial design.\n\n- Publish a replicable blueprint for revitalization: Add to our existing operational playbook, a field guide to regenerative rural coordination, covering governance design templates, renovation & waste management best practices, legal & logistical tips for working with municipalities and property owners, principles of place-based public goods design. We'd like to develop partnerships with other nodes in Regen Coordi-Nation to trade best practices for mutual support."

We\u2019re building the core architecture for our MVP, available at reap.deals, with active R&D focused on swarm intelligence algorithms for hyper-personalized recommendations and cross-platform integration across devices. Early trials include testing swarm logic with simulated smart home ecosystems, tracking algorithm accuracy and response times, and analyzing user interaction patterns. These efforts validate our tech\u2019s potential to scale across e-commerce, smart homes, and future physical commerce applications.\n\nOur go-to-market strategy unfolds in three phases. Phase 1 (2025) targets TikTok Shop, leveraging its global creator economy for initial user traction. We\u2019re developing integrations and crafting marketing campaigns to onboard early adopters, gathering real-time data to refine our AI and user experience. Phase 2 (2026) extends into smart home systems, where we\u2019re researching integration protocols with device ecosystems, aiming to embed deal discovery into daily environments\u2014especially in high-growth markets like Beijing\u2019s smart tech sector. Phase 3 (2027+) explores humanoid robot applications, with preliminary studies underway to bridge online and offline commerce and aiming to demonstrate Commerce Brain Grid\u2019s adaptability to physical commerce interfaces as robotics adoption rises.\n\nCurrently pre-revenue, we\u2019re channeling efforts into R&D and user acquisition groundwork. Initial customer acquisition efforts are focused on preparing for our Phase 1 TikTok Shop launch. We are growing our online presence via social media to generate buzz and build anticipation for the launch. Grant funding will be used to accelerate development, expand our team, and execute our TikTok Shop launch."

The farm is facing devastating challenges related \r\nto water shortages , land ownership issues and inability to compensate its 15 known farm laborers. This \r\nissue have significantly hindered farm productivity and lower morale of farm laborers. This proposal \r\nseek a funding to;\r\n\uf0a7 Develop and create a sustainable water supply system \r\n\uf0a7 Resolve land ownership issues by involving land surveyors to secure long-term farm stability\r\n\uf0a7 To provide fair compensation to laborers to sustain operation and also to boost their morale\r\nIntroduction\r\nKawagumba farm ,located in kochia homabay county-kenya has been a cornerstone of agricultural \r\nactivity in the region locally , providing sustenance and employment to its 15 farm workers and their \r\nfamilies . known for producing high quality crops such as ; onions , kales ,black night shade(osuga) \r\n,tomato ,spinach , and finally carrot which are organically grown.\r\nDespite its successes , the farm is now facing three critical challenges : water shortage ,land ownership \r\nissues , and difficulty in compensating farm workers. These issues have collectively reduced the \r\nproductivity and strained resources.\r\nWater shortage: due to uncertain rainfall and limited access to alternative water sources, the farm \r\nstruggles to maintain adequate irrigation. This has led to reduced crop yield and increased vulnerability \r\nto drought.\r\nLand ownership issues: the farms ability to expand and invest in long-term improvement is hindered by \r\ndisputes over land ownership. Without proper documentation kawagumba farms future is unseen.\r\nDifficulty in compensating farm labourers: with financial constrains limiting cash flow ,the farm has \r\nbeen unable to provide consistent cash flow and fair wages to its dedicated workers. This has not only \r\naffected morale but also risk losing skilled workers crucial to farm operation\r\nThese challenges require immediate and effective solution to resolve stability and ensure the farm\u2019s \r\nlong-term sustainability. This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to address these pressing issues \r\nallowing kawagumba farm to thrive once again as a vital agricultural resources.Problem statement\r\n1. Water shortages\r\nThe farm relies on seasonal rainfall which has become unpredictable due to climate changes.\r\nCurrent irrigation system is inadequate leading to poor crop yield and increased operational \r\ncosts.\r\n2. Land ownership issues\r\n The lack of clear land ownership documents affects the farms ability to access financing or \r\n Expand operations \r\n Dispute with neighbouring landholders have caused delays in implementing new projects.\r\n3. Laborers challenges\r\nWorkers have not received consistent wages , leading to devastating and low productivity.\r\nFinancial instability prevents the farm from retaining experienced and skilled laborers .\r\n4.

We have coalesced as a united group and developed the Voices of the Waterfront website to share activities and updates, directly countering NYC EDC\u2019s efforts to leave people out of this extremely important process which will influence New Yorkers for generations to come. voicesofthewaterfront.com\nWe have spoken and we have listened - to each other. We believe that the Red Hook community knows what is best for us. We support a modern working waterfront that will benefit not only Red Hook but the entire borough of Brooklyn and all of New York City. \nOur activities in recent months can be viewed on our Karma GAP project here: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-red-hook?tab=updates\nWe have collaborated as a community to develop 7 foundational principles for the Brooklyn Marine Terminal development. These principles are currently under review from the group and we will share updates as they are finalized. In brief: \n1. We want a resilient, thriving green port that serves our community and the region well, now and into the future.\n2. We want this port to operate as a public good, financed using similar models to those that sustain other vital public assets.\n3. We want investment that prioritizes neighborhood infrastructure and NYCHA before accommodating new market rate tenants.\n4. We want equity, revenue and profits to stay local through jobs, small business and other programs.\n5. We want a plan that integrates well with existing local and regional plans.\n6. We want all applicable state, federal, and local laws, frameworks, and codes to be followed.\n7. We want true community participation to be honored in the planning process, and we want our planning efforts to be supported by local and regional experts.\nOur primary goal for Q2 2025 is to resist the NYC Economic Development Corporation's inadequate proposed plan to develop the Brooklyn Marine Terminal (BMT) site in Red Hook. We are galvanizing the community and advocating to the BMT Task Force toward this end. \nOnce we shut down the currently proposed EDC plan and receive more time for the planning process, we will continue to organize and collaborate as a community to develop a comprehensive beneficial BMT plan which adheres to and honors the 7 principles listed above. \nIn addition to these primary goals, in 2025 we plan to engage in the following: \n- host 3 web3 onboarding workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host 2 regenerative finance workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host regular (weekly or biweekly) community cleanups around the waterfront in Red Hook \n- explore decentralized governance possibilities and share them with Red Hook community (such as creation of a DAO) \n- host monthly water workshops led in collaboration with water artist and activist Betsy Damon \n- unite local water organizations such as Resilient Red Hook, PortSide NY and RETI Center through events and shared technology  \n- support Resilient Red Hook's initiatives (https://www.resilient-red-hook.com/) especially participation in the Rise to Resilience coalition (https://rise2resilience.org/)\nIt has been a great joy and honor to participate in grassroots organizing, to experience the tenacity of community, and to uphold the legacy of Red Hook as a historical maritime powerhouse, a haven for artists and creatives, a melting pot of diversity, and a neighborhood on the waterfront. \nThank you for your time, attention, and participation in the story of Red Hook, Brooklyn. We are very grateful. "

We'll also host workshops and tutorials for our community partners. \n\nWe are also going to commit a portion of the USDGLO received from this round to planting commitment pools on Silvi. The goal is to use these funds to reward the white pine tree planters to update their progress and continue to use their wallets and Silvi as an app. \n\nWe are co-hosting and sponsoring Ottawa Bitcoin Pizza Day for the 3rd year in a row.\n\nWe are continuing to work with Regeneration Canada to help bring aspects of their work on-chain and help them find ways to integrate blockchain/crypto.  \n\nWe are a part of the GreenPill Genesis staking squad and will work with other Ottawa community members to set up and be a part of the GPN staking squad. \n\nOne of our goals this year is to use a portion of our treasury in DeFi lending pools to then use the yield earned to donate to local charities and organizations. Our goal at the end of the year is to write a recap report on how the community can use DeFi to fund their causes without touching their principal. "

We aim to increase volunteer participation and the frequency of these events, thereby maximizing our direct environmental impact.\nWe plan to enhance our educational programs, focusing on raising awareness about marine conservation and sustainable waste management within the Cartagena community.\nA milestone is to establish a consistent monthly cleanup schedule, and to have a 25% increase in volunteer participation.\nEmpowering Cartagena through Web3 and Regenerative Finance (ReFi):\n\nWe are committed to deepening our integration of blockchain technology to decentralize funding and foster a thriving ReFi economy within Cartagena.\nOur goal is to develop and implement pilot projects that demonstrate the practical applications of blockchain in environmental conservation, such as transparent donation tracking and community-based funding mechanisms.\nA milestone is to implement a blockchain based, transparent donation tracking system, and to have at least 2 proof of concept for refi econony implementation.\nStrategic Partnerships and Public Awareness:\n\nOur partnership with Mall Plaza is a cornerstone of our strategy to reach a wider audience and educate the public about regeneration and blockchain.\nWe aim to leverage this partnership to host regular workshops, presentations, and interactive events within the shopping center, creating a hub for community engagement and education.\nA milestone is to have at least 1 public event per month, at the mall plaza, and to increase our social media reach by 30%.\nWe want to continue to build partneships with other local organizations.\nEssentially, we're focused on building a stronger, more environmentally conscious community in Cartagena, while simultaneously pioneering the use of blockchain to drive sustainable, regenerative economic growth."
