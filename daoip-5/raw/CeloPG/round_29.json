1. Overview\nThis proposal aims to bring GoodMicrogrants back to life as a monthly, on-chain, community-powered microgrant program that rewards individuals who sell goods or services in exchange for GoodDollars. The new version of the platform will be lean, partially automated, and fully transparent, lowering the operational burden while expanding its reach and impact globally.\n\nThe mission remains the same: amplify GoodDollar’s use as a real economic tool, by supporting those who accept it for value exchange. But with improved infrastructure, automated workflows, and reputation-based eligibility, the program can now scale in ways the original implementation couldn’t.\n\n## Why GoodMicroGrants Matter\nThe single most impactful thing that could happen to the GoodDollar ecosystem is for sellers to begin accepting GoodDollar as payment. This simple shift transforms GoodDollar from just a claimable token into a usable currency in real life. GoodMicroGrants kickstarts a circular economy where value flows between people, not just into wallets. Every transaction made in GoodDollar deepens its utility, legitimacy, and reach. But for that circular economy to take root, early adopters—especially sellers of goods and services—need support. That’s where GoodMicrogrants comes in: a targeted incentive program to reward and uplift the individuals helping to make GoodDollar real in everyday life.\n\n## How does it work? \nIt's simple. As a seller or service provider you first start accepting GoodDollar as payment for your services. Anywhere. Then fill our a simple form to apply to GoodMicroGrants. In the form you describe your \"store\", the services you sell and which wallet you use to accept payments. You also get verified as a real human through Cubid. After you application is approved you don't need to do anything else. Just keep selling. And then at the end of the month GoodMicroGrants would send you some extra GoodDollar as a matching contribution. The amount you get will depend on how many unique customers you had vs how many all other sellers had, and the available GoodDollars in the matching pool.\n\n# 2. Project Objective\nThe goal of this project is to revive GoodMicrogrants as a global, recurring monthly funding round focused exclusively on GoodDollar sellers—individuals who accept GoodDollar for goods, services, or peer-to-peer exchanges (e.g. selling used items).\n\nThe system will:\n- Automate key parts of the application, review, and distribution pipeline\n- Replace manual BrightID verification with Cubid-score-based eligibility\n- Operate with optimistic approvals and on-chain transparency\n- Introduce a lightweight governance and review layer via the GoodDAO\n- Rebuild the site as a modern, modular dApp + indexer stack\n- Enable future expansion into local and regional microgrant variants\n\n\n# 3. Key Features & Proposed Improvements\nWe will deliver this project as five different sub-projects  / phases.\n\n## Phase 1: Replace BrightID with Cubid-Score for Eligibility\nThe previous version relied on BrightID for human verification. We're proposing to replace that with a Cubid humanity score threshold to determine applicant eligibility. This change unlocks the ability to:\n- Automate eligibility checks\n- Support self-service onboarding\n- Reward users with deeper web3 identity graphs\n- Tie into existing Cubid integrations across the ecosystem\n\nOptimistic approvals will be granted to anyone who meets the application criteria and exceeds the Cubid score threshold. Applications can be vetoed by a designated admin (Steve) if necessary.\n\nBrightID can still potentially be still used as a soft requirement in parallel with Cubid, or as a second layer prior to distributing a grant, but should not be the first requirement as it is not fully self-serve nor permissionless. \n\n## Phase 2: Add DAO Oversight for Veto Power and Legitimacy\nWhile applications will be optimistically approved, a lightweight governance layer will be added in Phase 2:\n- Use the GoodDAO (or a separate microDAO) to review incoming applications\n- Allow DAO members to flag or veto bad actors or ineligible submissions\n- Optionally, introduce snapshot-based voting or Cubid-weighted governance for future iterations\n\nThis adds credibility, trust, and decentralization without bottlenecking the flow of funds.\n\n## Phase 3: Rebuild as a Light dApp with an Indexer\nThe existing GoodMicrogrants site will be rebuilt into a lightweight dApp that includes:\n- Wallet connect and Rainbow kit for login\n- On-chain application submissions\n- Live display of past winners and funded projects\n- Indexer integration for programmatic view of who sold what, when, and for how much\n- Basic analytics (e.g. average grant size, total funds distributed)\n- Optional integration of quadratic matching logic either via a spreadsheet feed or built-in calculation\n\nAn indexer will be developed to:\n- Track GoodDollar spending activity related to sales of goods or services\n- Prepare structured data for each round\n- Reduce reliance on manual spreadsheet tracking\n\nThis makes the program scalable, transparent, and compatible with future automation layers.\n\n## Phase 4. Integrate with Marketplaces for Direct Grants\nWhere possible, microgrants will be distributed based on verified GoodDollar sales processed through:\n- Marketplaces where payments are tracked on-chain\n- Classifieds platforms that natively accept and record GoodDollar transactions\n\nThis removes the need for manual applications altogether in some cases. Sellers who use online marketplace platforms without on-chain payments will still be able to apply manually through the dApp, provided they meet the Cubid score threshold.\n\n## Phase 5. Add Community-Funding Mechanisms\nTo increase funding and sustainability, the program will be supplemented by:\n- Optional daily claim opt-ins (users can donate a portion of their daily G$)\n- Matching fund contributions from aligned DAOs and protocols\n- Direct donations from the community\n- Campaigns to bring ecosystem partners into the funding flow\n\nNote: SDK fee mechanisms will not be included.\n\n\n# 4. Roles and Team\n- Steve (previous GoodDollar community steward) will act as administrator, answering questions, resolving disputes, and vetoing invalid applications when necessary\n- Noak (previous GoodDollar Developer Evangelist) will act as sponsor, architect and mentor\n- Community Developers will build and maintain the lightweight dApp and indexer. We will source developers through the community Telegram channels, forum, and potentially also through DeWork depending on how much grants we end up getting.\n- Community members and GoodDAO participants will help with review and governance\n- The broader GoodDollar community will contribute to promotion, education, and feedback\n\n\n# 5. Technical Architecture\n- Frontend: Next.js / React-based dApp with wallet connect and on-chain submission UI\n- Backend/Indexing: Custom indexer for tracking eligible transactions and preparing round data\n- Eligibility: Verified via Cubid humanity score threshold\n- Governance: Optimistic approvals with DAO-based veto capability\n- Grant Distribution: Fully on-chain, public, and auditable\n\n\n# 6. Timeline & Scope\nThis proposal focuses on delivering a light, community-driven MVP, designed to support monthly grant rounds with very low operational overhead.\n\nEstimated time to deploy MVP, after the conclusion of Gitcoin 23. \n- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks\n- Phase 2: 4–6 weeks\n- Phase 3: 6–10 weeks\n- Phase 4: TBD\n- Phase 5: TBD\n\nDisclaimer: Depending on the amount of grants awarded and the amount of volunteer community support we receive, we may implement this project partially or slower than outlined above.\n\nFuture improvements—including a robust quadratic voting UI, advanced analytics, or deeper DAO integrations—can be explored once the MVP proves itself and additional funding becomes available through Gitcoin or other channels.\n\n\n# 7. Funding Model\nThis proposal is submitted as a retroactive public goods grant, intended for consideration via Gitcoin or similar platforms. No upfront funding is required; instead, we aim to show tangible impact and earn support based on results.\n\n\n# 8. In Closing\nGoodMicrogrants is a simple but powerful idea that deserves a second life. With a modern, modular design and light operational footprint, it can now become a reliable, recurring way to reward real GoodDollar usage around the world. Sellers get support. The ecosystem gets activity. And the community gets a transparent, replicable model for micro-economic empowerment.\n\nLet’s bring it back—stronger, smarter, and ready to grow.\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"Cubid-Me","projectTwitter":"GoodMicroGrants"},"recipient":"0xB4bf0F23c702EFB8a9da87A94095e28dE3D21Cc3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidwf24lf5mu43tflypxh65etgtjpo6r4lgal54r6yirylfc2zz2c4","projects":[{"name":"Reviving GoodMicroGrants — Automated, Scalable, and Community-Led","id":"0xa19668b0cd093335940c9e860d0c602eb168506f3112832acc4841455f341e53","metadata":{"title":"Reviving GoodMicroGrants — Automated, Scalable, and Community-Led","logoImg":"bafkreigs7wyt47t5bnmkyr4qii6dnibn3lvbi6mof5bxhidbzgkzl2dlay","website":"https://GoodMicroGrants.com","bannerImg":"bafkreidepzmyimxuqdfyq7vtgdqmzukufleylgnl2rryjgvtiz3m6jogza","createdAt":1743452624389,"userGithub":"KazanderDad","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-31T21:58:45.490Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0x7d4cb69031ac650b1634591af00638fa39129bdf4e3b2ae1c73b9bd48fd683674a619d4ec46dace14592268a9bdf64812ff9ce58a395e082746f256ef23896fc1b","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-31T21:58:45.490Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-29T21:58:45.490Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xE757B9475e8BDabfeF5bF6b7850dFd90971bf77F","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#Cubid-Me#98373366","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:mpACiXZT3p7mEm88YAhD2fg5/ppfqlgN60K7tiMcYBU="]}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-31T20:07:16.362Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0xaf3bd1f98d9815299585b258a84ff70a0265365ae791de8fdf016b406e423d8a3d96b6ad5a0e5af32560463b74d9544438f59462d5d4b14352bb74ae536fcb4a1b","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-31T20:07:16.362Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-29T20:07:16.362Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xE757B9475e8BDabfeF5bF6b7850dFd90971bf77F","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#GoodMicroGrants","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:ypYAmjkBAvG+W4qfAZVS4ZakHm4PBfsfHf45QMkdjeE="]}}},"description":"# 1.

But with improved infrastructure, automated workflows, and reputation-based eligibility, the program can now scale in ways the original implementation couldn’t.\n\n## Why GoodMicroGrants Matter\nThe single most impactful thing that could happen to the GoodDollar ecosystem is for sellers to begin accepting GoodDollar as payment. This simple shift transforms GoodDollar from just a claimable token into a usable currency in real life. GoodMicroGrants kickstarts a circular economy where value flows between people, not just into wallets. Every transaction made in GoodDollar deepens its utility, legitimacy, and reach. But for that circular economy to take root, early adopters—especially sellers of goods and services—need support. That’s where GoodMicrogrants comes in: a targeted incentive program to reward and uplift the individuals helping to make GoodDollar real in everyday life.\n\n## How does it work? \nIt's simple. As a seller or service provider you first start accepting GoodDollar as payment for your services. Anywhere. Then fill our a simple form to apply to GoodMicroGrants. In the form you describe your \"store\", the services you sell and which wallet you use to accept payments. You also get verified as a real human through Cubid. After you application is approved you don't need to do anything else. Just keep selling. And then at the end of the month GoodMicroGrants would send you some extra GoodDollar as a matching contribution. The amount you get will depend on how many unique customers you had vs how many all other sellers had, and the available GoodDollars in the matching pool.\n\n# 2. Project Objective\nThe goal of this project is to revive GoodMicrogrants as a global, recurring monthly funding round focused exclusively on GoodDollar sellers—individuals who accept GoodDollar for goods, services, or peer-to-peer exchanges (e.g. selling used items).\n\nThe system will:\n- Automate key parts of the application, review, and distribution pipeline\n- Replace manual BrightID verification with Cubid-score-based eligibility\n- Operate with optimistic approvals and on-chain transparency\n- Introduce a lightweight governance and review layer via the GoodDAO\n- Rebuild the site as a modern, modular dApp + indexer stack\n- Enable future expansion into local and regional microgrant variants\n\n\n# 3. Key Features & Proposed Improvements\nWe will deliver this project as five different sub-projects  / phases.\n\n## Phase 1: Replace BrightID with Cubid-Score for Eligibility\nThe previous version relied on BrightID for human verification. We're proposing to replace that with a Cubid humanity score threshold to determine applicant eligibility. This change unlocks the ability to:\n- Automate eligibility checks\n- Support self-service onboarding\n- Reward users with deeper web3 identity graphs\n- Tie into existing Cubid integrations across the ecosystem\n\nOptimistic approvals will be granted to anyone who meets the application criteria and exceeds the Cubid score threshold. Applications can be vetoed by a designated admin (Steve) if necessary.\n\nBrightID can still potentially be still used as a soft requirement in parallel with Cubid, or as a second layer prior to distributing a grant, but should not be the first requirement as it is not fully self-serve nor permissionless. \n\n## Phase 2: Add DAO Oversight for Veto Power and Legitimacy\nWhile applications will be optimistically approved, a lightweight governance layer will be added in Phase 2:\n- Use the GoodDAO (or a separate microDAO) to review incoming applications\n- Allow DAO members to flag or veto bad actors or ineligible submissions\n- Optionally, introduce snapshot-based voting or Cubid-weighted governance for future iterations\n\nThis adds credibility, trust, and decentralization without bottlenecking the flow of funds.\n\n## Phase 3: Rebuild as a Light dApp with an Indexer\nThe existing GoodMicrogrants site will be rebuilt into a lightweight dApp that includes:\n- Wallet connect and Rainbow kit for login\n- On-chain application submissions\n- Live display of past winners and funded projects\n- Indexer integration for programmatic view of who sold what, when, and for how much\n- Basic analytics (e.g. average grant size, total funds distributed)\n- Optional integration of quadratic matching logic either via a spreadsheet feed or built-in calculation\n\nAn indexer will be developed to:\n- Track GoodDollar spending activity related to sales of goods or services\n- Prepare structured data for each round\n- Reduce reliance on manual spreadsheet tracking\n\nThis makes the program scalable, transparent, and compatible with future automation layers.\n\n## Phase 4. Integrate with Marketplaces for Direct Grants\nWhere possible, microgrants will be distributed based on verified GoodDollar sales processed through:\n- Marketplaces where payments are tracked on-chain\n- Classifieds platforms that natively accept and record GoodDollar transactions\n\nThis removes the need for manual applications altogether in some cases. Sellers who use online marketplace platforms without on-chain payments will still be able to apply manually through the dApp, provided they meet the Cubid score threshold.\n\n## Phase 5. Add Community-Funding Mechanisms\nTo increase funding and sustainability, the program will be supplemented by:\n- Optional daily claim opt-ins (users can donate a portion of their daily G$)\n- Matching fund contributions from aligned DAOs and protocols\n- Direct donations from the community\n- Campaigns to bring ecosystem partners into the funding flow\n\nNote: SDK fee mechanisms will not be included.\n\n\n# 4. Roles and Team\n- Steve (previous GoodDollar community steward) will act as administrator, answering questions, resolving disputes, and vetoing invalid applications when necessary\n- Noak (previous GoodDollar Developer Evangelist) will act as sponsor, architect and mentor\n- Community Developers will build and maintain the lightweight dApp and indexer. We will source developers through the community Telegram channels, forum, and potentially also through DeWork depending on how much grants we end up getting.\n- Community members and GoodDAO participants will help with review and governance\n- The broader GoodDollar community will contribute to promotion, education, and feedback\n\n\n# 5. Technical Architecture\n- Frontend: Next.js / React-based dApp with wallet connect and on-chain submission UI\n- Backend/Indexing: Custom indexer for tracking eligible transactions and preparing round data\n- Eligibility: Verified via Cubid humanity score threshold\n- Governance: Optimistic approvals with DAO-based veto capability\n- Grant Distribution: Fully on-chain, public, and auditable\n\n\n# 6. Timeline & Scope\nThis proposal focuses on delivering a light, community-driven MVP, designed to support monthly grant rounds with very low operational overhead.\n\nEstimated time to deploy MVP, after the conclusion of Gitcoin 23. \n- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks\n- Phase 2: 4–6 weeks\n- Phase 3: 6–10 weeks\n- Phase 4: TBD\n- Phase 5: TBD\n\nDisclaimer: Depending on the amount of grants awarded and the amount of volunteer community support we receive, we may implement this project partially or slower than outlined above.\n\nFuture improvements—including a robust quadratic voting UI, advanced analytics, or deeper DAO integrations—can be explored once the MVP proves itself and additional funding becomes available through Gitcoin or other channels.\n\n\n# 7. Funding Model\nThis proposal is submitted as a retroactive public goods grant, intended for consideration via Gitcoin or similar platforms. No upfront funding is required; instead, we aim to show tangible impact and earn support based on results.\n\n\n# 8. In Closing\nGoodMicrogrants is a simple but powerful idea that deserves a second life. With a modern, modular design and light operational footprint, it can now become a reliable, recurring way to reward real GoodDollar usage around the world. Sellers get support. The ecosystem gets activity. And the community gets a transparent, replicable model for micro-economic empowerment.\n\nLet’s bring it back—stronger, smarter, and ready to grow.\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Cubid-Me","projectTwitter":"GoodMicroGrants"},"metadataCid":"bafkreibmut7v3et3f26qyuvd3wognp43mqtmmlkob3zt2xxaalqcudc6ou","timestamp":"2025-03-31T20:24:01+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xE757B9475e8BDabfeF5bF6b7850dFd90971bf77F","createdAtBlock":31551883}],"projectId":"0xa19668b0cd093335940c9e860d0c602eb168506f3112832acc4841455f341e53","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"29","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-31T22:11:34.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31558336"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-06T11:29:36.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"32038218"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32200158,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-31T22:11:34+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0xCEfCE418A1E70b2f9e60CDF0c2B2487719F36916","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31978178,"createdByAddress":"0x4b82fD44b2530e971EA97bF45b1FbB60DF46C1A8","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"34","metadata":{"signature":"0x51cbbf5f88b29ddd2a419681a9cebf168a42e35e733b6226c573f76ac6e1b74803f408aa37ff92e8d547ca624efb863ccf69bbea930f672a4ed8c53a429b40901c","application":{"round":"0x3aA3C6cc0004b7366A12b8E4262015AF525531a9","answers":[{"type":"short-answer","answer":"This project introduces an AI-powered tipping agent designed to seamlessly integrate crypto-native monetization and community engagement into X (formerly Twitter).

Problem Statement\nDespite the growing popularity of content platforms like X (formerly Twitter), content creators often face challenges in monetizing their work effectively and engaging their audience in meaningful ways. Traditional monetization methods are limited, slow, and often platform-dependent, creating barriers for both creators and their supporters.\n\nThere is a lack of seamless, crypto-native tools that enable fans to support creators directly, transparently, and in real time. Furthermore, there are few incentives or gamified features that can enhance audience participation and reward loyal supporters.\n\nAdditionally, existing tipping and donation systems do not offer insights into user behavior or history, making it difficult for creators to track engagement or reward top supporters. Withdrawal of funds is often a manual, complex process, especially when integrating with external crypto wallets.\n\nThis project aims to solve these problems by introducing an AI-powered agent that simplifies and enhances creator monetization through the following features:\n\n- Creation of crypto wallets linked to X accounts\n- Instant peer-to-peer tipping in crypto\n- Community engagement tools like raffles and giveaways\n- Detailed tipping statistics and analytics\n- Easy withdrawal of funds to external Ethereum addresses\n\nBy leveraging AI and blockchain, this solution empowers content creators and fans alike with a decentralized, transparent, and engaging support ecosystem.\n\n# About\n\nThis project is about an AI Agent that helps X users support their favorite content creators. It also allows content creators to better monetize their content and to boost engagement. All that with crypto! The Agent can\n1. Create 'twitter' wallets\n2. Send tips from one X user to another\n3. Create giveaways/raffles (for the tippers of a user)\n4. Show statistics about tipping history\n5. Send ETH from 'twitter' account to external address (withdrawal of funds)\n\n# How it's made\n\n- The AI agent is based on a fork of the eliza-starter repository. It implements one provider and four actions.\n- The tips that take place are routed through a smart contract which keeps a 10% fee. This smart contract was developed with solidity using the Foundry framework and was deployed on Base Mainnet. It's main purpose is to collect fees and emit events.\n- The 'twitter' wallets are created and managed with the CPD-SDK.\n- The user statistics and the winner giveaways use The Graph to access and query onchain data.\n- The agent data are stored on two sqlite databases.\n\n# Instructions\n\nHow to use this AI agent for tipping (and giveaways if you are a content creator) with (Base) ETH.\n\n\n1. How to setup your \"twitter\" address/wallet:\n\nYou only have to setup your address if you want to tip someone. If you want to receive tips there is no setup required.\nTo setup your \"twitter\" wallet tag the agent at any post/reply. The agent will tell you your public address. Fund this addess by transfering Base ETH to it from an external wallet (like metamask).\n\n2. How to tip:\n\nBefore tipping make sure that you transfer some funds to your address from step 1.\n\nThe creator that you tip does not need to do any setup/interactions with the agent. Any creator can be tipped.\n\nThe default tipping amount is 0.0004 (~$0.10) but you can tip with less or more than that by specifying the tip amount (see below). If you tip with the default amount but you don't have enough balance, then the tip amount will be equal to you balance.\n\n2.1 Tip by posting\n\nYou can tip by tagging the agent and the creator that you want to tip. Do not tag any other users.\n\nYour message has to indicate that you want to tip the creator. To indicate that, you can\n1) Say nothing (just tag the agent and the creator). Example of such post: \"@agent @creator\"\n2) Provide the amount you want to tip (in ETH) while also tagging the agent and the creator. Examples: \"@agent @creator 0.001\", \"0.001 ETH @creator @agent\"\n3) Say something more descriptive which indicates that you want to tip the tagged creator. Optionally you can include the amount of the tip. Examples \"@agent tip this creator @creator please\", \"could you @agent tip this @creator 0.001 ETH?\"\n\n2.2 Tip by replying\n\nYou can tip by tagging the agent at the replies of a post from the creator of your choice. Do not tag any other users.\n\nYour message has to indicate that you want to tip the creator. To indicate that, you can\n1) Say nothing (just tag the agent). Example of such reply: \"@agent\"\n2) Provide the amount you want to tip (in ETH) while also tagging the agent. Examples: \"@agent 0.001\", \"0.001 ETH @agent\"\n3) Say something more descriptive which indicates that you want to tip the creator that made the post that you're replying to. Optionally you can include the amount of the tip. Examples \"@agent tip this creator please\", \"could you @agent tip this creator 0.001 ETH?\"\n\n\n3. How to withdraw:\n\nTo withdraw you need to make a post that mentions/tags the agent and includes the wallet address that you want to withdraw to. Examples of such posts: \"@agent 0x1231231231231231231231231231231231231231\", \"withdraw 0x1231231231231231231231231231231231231231 @agent\"\n\n4. How to do a giveaway:\n\nWhen you do a giveaway you randomly choose a user from those that have tipped you (any amount) and you send them the balance that you 'twitter' wallet has.\n\nIn order to do a giveaway you need to have been tipped by at least one user.\n\nTo do a giveaway, make a post tagging the agent and indicate that you want to do a giveaway. Examples of such posts: \"@agent giveaway\", \"GIVEAWAYYYY @agent\", \"give awaaaay!!! @agent\", \"yo, @agent do a giveaway now\"\n\n5. How to see the address and/or balance of your 'twitter' wallet\n\nMake a post tagging the agent and asking for your address and/or balance. Examples of such posts: \"@agent tell my balance\", \"balance @agent\", \"show me address @agent\"\n\n6.

Traditional monetization methods are limited, slow, and often platform-dependent, creating barriers for both creators and their supporters.\n\nThere is a lack of seamless, crypto-native tools that enable fans to support creators directly, transparently, and in real time. Furthermore, there are few incentives or gamified features that can enhance audience participation and reward loyal supporters.\n\nAdditionally, existing tipping and donation systems do not offer insights into user behavior or history, making it difficult for creators to track engagement or reward top supporters. Withdrawal of funds is often a manual, complex process, especially when integrating with external crypto wallets.\n\nThis project aims to solve these problems by introducing an AI-powered agent that simplifies and enhances creator monetization through the following features:\n\n- Creation of crypto wallets linked to X accounts\n- Instant peer-to-peer tipping in crypto\n- Community engagement tools like raffles and giveaways\n- Detailed tipping statistics and analytics\n- Easy withdrawal of funds to external Ethereum addresses\n\nBy leveraging AI and blockchain, this solution empowers content creators and fans alike with a decentralized, transparent, and engaging support ecosystem.\n\n# About\n\nThis project is about an AI Agent that helps X users support their favorite content creators. It also allows content creators to better monetize their content and to boost engagement. All that with crypto! The Agent can\n1. Create 'twitter' wallets\n2. Send tips from one X user to another\n3. Create giveaways/raffles (for the tippers of a user)\n4. Show statistics about tipping history\n5. Send ETH from 'twitter' account to external address (withdrawal of funds)\n\n# How it's made\n\n- The AI agent is based on a fork of the eliza-starter repository. It implements one provider and four actions.\n- The tips that take place are routed through a smart contract which keeps a 10% fee. This smart contract was developed with solidity using the Foundry framework and was deployed on Base Mainnet. It's main purpose is to collect fees and emit events.\n- The 'twitter' wallets are created and managed with the CPD-SDK.\n- The user statistics and the winner giveaways use The Graph to access and query onchain data.\n- The agent data are stored on two sqlite databases.\n\n# Instructions\n\nHow to use this AI agent for tipping (and giveaways if you are a content creator) with (Base) ETH.\n\n\n1. How to setup your \"twitter\" address/wallet:\n\nYou only have to setup your address if you want to tip someone. If you want to receive tips there is no setup required.\nTo setup your \"twitter\" wallet tag the agent at any post/reply. The agent will tell you your public address. Fund this addess by transfering Base ETH to it from an external wallet (like metamask).\n\n2. How to tip:\n\nBefore tipping make sure that you transfer some funds to your address from step 1.\n\nThe creator that you tip does not need to do any setup/interactions with the agent. Any creator can be tipped.\n\nThe default tipping amount is 0.0004 (~$0.10) but you can tip with less or more than that by specifying the tip amount (see below). If you tip with the default amount but you don't have enough balance, then the tip amount will be equal to you balance.\n\n2.1 Tip by posting\n\nYou can tip by tagging the agent and the creator that you want to tip. Do not tag any other users.\n\nYour message has to indicate that you want to tip the creator. To indicate that, you can\n1) Say nothing (just tag the agent and the creator). Example of such post: \"@agent @creator\"\n2) Provide the amount you want to tip (in ETH) while also tagging the agent and the creator. Examples: \"@agent @creator 0.001\", \"0.001 ETH @creator @agent\"\n3) Say something more descriptive which indicates that you want to tip the tagged creator. Optionally you can include the amount of the tip. Examples \"@agent tip this creator @creator please\", \"could you @agent tip this @creator 0.001 ETH?\"\n\n2.2 Tip by replying\n\nYou can tip by tagging the agent at the replies of a post from the creator of your choice. Do not tag any other users.\n\nYour message has to indicate that you want to tip the creator. To indicate that, you can\n1) Say nothing (just tag the agent). Example of such reply: \"@agent\"\n2) Provide the amount you want to tip (in ETH) while also tagging the agent. Examples: \"@agent 0.001\", \"0.001 ETH @agent\"\n3) Say something more descriptive which indicates that you want to tip the creator that made the post that you're replying to. Optionally you can include the amount of the tip. Examples \"@agent tip this creator please\", \"could you @agent tip this creator 0.001 ETH?\"\n\n\n3. How to withdraw:\n\nTo withdraw you need to make a post that mentions/tags the agent and includes the wallet address that you want to withdraw to. Examples of such posts: \"@agent 0x1231231231231231231231231231231231231231\", \"withdraw 0x1231231231231231231231231231231231231231 @agent\"\n\n4. How to do a giveaway:\n\nWhen you do a giveaway you randomly choose a user from those that have tipped you (any amount) and you send them the balance that you 'twitter' wallet has.\n\nIn order to do a giveaway you need to have been tipped by at least one user.\n\nTo do a giveaway, make a post tagging the agent and indicate that you want to do a giveaway. Examples of such posts: \"@agent giveaway\", \"GIVEAWAYYYY @agent\", \"give awaaaay!!! @agent\", \"yo, @agent do a giveaway now\"\n\n5. How to see the address and/or balance of your 'twitter' wallet\n\nMake a post tagging the agent and asking for your address and/or balance. Examples of such posts: \"@agent tell my balance\", \"balance @agent\", \"show me address @agent\"\n\n6. How to see statistics about your tipping history\n\nMake a post tagging the agent and asking for statistics. Examples of such posts: \"@agent stats\", \"statistics @agent\", \"show me some stats @agent\"\n\n\nNotes:\nThis agent cannot be tipped.\nFee on tips: 10%\nDefault tip amount: 0.00004 ETH (~$0.10)\nWhen calculating the balance of the 'twitter' wallet and when making a tip/withdrawal/giveaway, a small amount of ETH (0.000005 ETH (~$0.01)) is withheld by the 'twitter' wallet to be spent in gas fees. This amount cannot be withdrawn.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Tip-This-Creator","projectTwitter":"tipthisc"},"metadataCid":"bafkreihpslgikysqbvgpc6aubti4v46maddwj2ywsap6il3prbvkjga4w4","timestamp":"2025-04-05T18:17:04+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x4b82fD44b2530e971EA97bF45b1FbB60DF46C1A8","createdAtBlock":31976266}],"projectId":"0xa379f4cccc0a3d3dd3500682f8daf953cea736f701048602c16a3d2dec1a2ff3","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"29","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-04-05T18:48:56.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31978178"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-08T08:28:36.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"32200158"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32200158,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-04-05T18:48:56+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0xdEc92fb9372e040f9cE2aF1CE57d98EEd246160C","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":32029882,"createdByAddress":"0x8BC2dF46544eA6B7065e43C5BadB84Ee6Aa4B00E","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"39","metadata":{"signature":"0xb9963d132d4edb89cb32f3e787662643d2797bf0da9a0d2227acd8f6490160664dfcdadeaf9ea17cfb527e54e2ea1dcd430737690cce3a76539dadb562d45cf41c","application":{"round":"0x3aA3C6cc0004b7366A12b8E4262015AF525531a9","answers":[{"type":"short-answer","answer":"The H.E.R.

AUTODAO (https://ethglobal.com/showcase/auto-dao-t0und)\n    In this project my team won 2 prizes in the ETHGlobal hackathon. I mostly developed the frontend and did the DIMO integration.\n    2. Bonding Curve Presale (https://github.com/spyros-zikos/Bonding-Curve-Presale)\n    This is a project I developed for a company named White Had DAO which wanted to launch a new product and wanted me do build their smart contracts.\n    3. Tip This Creator (https://github.com/spyros-zikos/tip-this-creator)\n    I developed this project during the Agentic Ethereum ETHGlobal hackathon. It is an AI agent that helps twitter users tip their favorite content creators using crypto.\n\n## Milestones\nMilestone 1 - Until 30/04: Smart contract developement and testing.\nMilestone 2 - Until 30/07: Unique identity system integration and front-end developement.\nMilestone 3 - Until 30/10: Deploy to Celo and get funding to do marketing and BD.\nMilestone 4 - Until 30/12: Get 10k paying users.\n\n## Growth Strategy\nI think that initially the main driver of traffic will be from partnerships with web3 educational platforms or web3 creators. These partners will be able to better monetize their content while also engaging with their audience more effectively. After gaining some users and revenue we can attract more people and host a wider variety of examination subjects and certificates by advertising and partnering with educators of any subject.\n\n## Funding Needed (Estimates)\nEstimated min and max amounts per milestone.\nFor milestone 1, max: $3k, min: $2k\nFor milestone 2, max: $5k, min: $2k\nFor milestone 3, max: $5k, min: $200\nFor milestone 4, max: $5k, min: $0\n\n## Competition\nI am not aware of any other projects in the GoodDollar ecosystem that would be considered as competitors. I believe Web3 Certifier will be a unique platform that will attract many educators to the Celo chain and the GoodDollar ecosystem that want to create certifications for their audience. This project is aligned with the GoodDollar ecosystem because its goal is to make education universally available.","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"Web3-Certifier","projectTwitter":"web3certifier"},"recipient":"0x637365C8697C63186dC4759bd0F10af9B32D3c1A"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiccle6esci62q5q2nun47xulqjlqxim7y2wmoo5746xjn2e2d34hi","projects":[{"name":"Web3 Certifier","id":"0xf5cbd99a3f1a9602d7248fdcef6309b0ea469536d76541b6b006ad4d504df0df","metadata":{"title":"Web3 Certifier","logoImg":"bafkreigw5fbffshdat6dg3hpnybtzmoop3i7fy7ppivtyy6xp2dyxv5l5q","website":"https://web3-certifier-deployment-nextjs-git-main-spyros-zikos-projects.vercel.app","bannerImg":"bafkreigtrhzy6guph5lwervnafg2h3q5qayeoapv255yy46smykajyrt54","createdAt":1742910447143,"userGithub":"spyros-zikos","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-27T17:25:31.198Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0x094cf8c8fbad1cdde39018d9a45fe361f27c6ffaf076c1a0b30a49025b3e344020b760bcce959727796de932b1c4436d5770ebe97c3c64ee00e8436c4eeda55b1b","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-27T17:25:31.198Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-25T17:25:31.198Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x637365C8697C63186dC4759bd0F10af9B32D3c1A","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#Web3-Certifier#83170047","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:8FlOg9d94VjxT6S1eApNIzFEJkbhufXmnmhjZQggAQQ="]}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-25T13:23:00.830Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0xa641eea44be28c46b2f6e2d46dc79a607c0e390086d7f0bc5f344f80011bbf865b2762dcf7ce5bc05ae48eaa206f7497cf7dac9b7e612c95872dcac8b79a7cdb1c","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-25T13:23:00.830Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-23T13:23:00.830Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x637365C8697C63186dC4759bd0F10af9B32D3c1A","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#web3certifier","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:U7QtT037ocyIGgYcNTmuGa0Fk57geefnLWfvQuKz6l8="]}}},"description":"## What is it?\nWeb3 Certifier is a blockchain-based examination platform. The users that pass the examinations get NFT certificates. The examinations are multiple-choice questions with 4 possible answers. The exam process is done in 4 steps:\n1. Certifier creates exam with questions.\n2. Users submit answers to the exam.\n3. After examination end the certifier has 5 minutes to correct the exam by providing the answers.\n4. If the user has passed the exam, they can claim their NFT certificate.\nAlso, there is an AI Agent running on Discord that can recommend an exam based on users' interests or summarize the skills of a user based on their certifications. For more info reach out on discord (my username: \"elamore_\").\n\n## GoodDollar Identity\nI need to use the GoodDollar unique identity system so that I can make a type of exam that is only for real users and only allows each user to submit once. That way certifiers can create exams that check if the user that submits the answers is real or not while preventing multiple submission attempts from different accounts of the same user. Also, I would love to deploy on Celo due to its beginner friendly features and its strong momentum. The implementation of the identity system will be done using the \"gooddollar/web3sdk-v2\" library.\n\n## Team\nRight now the team consists only by me, Spyros. I am a blockchain developer and also have experience in full-stack development. You can see my previous projects on my github: https://github.com/spyros-zikos?tab=repositories.\nSome of them are:\n1.

This knowledge sharing enhances the ecosystem by fostering a more informed user base.\nIntegration with Existing Platforms:\nBy utilizing the GoodDollar API, our project ensures seamless integration with the existing ecosystem, allowing users to easily transition between earning rewards and spending them within the GoodDollar framework.\nOverall, our initiative acts as a complementary layer to the GoodDollar ecosystem, driving engagement and promoting shared values without competing with existing projects.","hidden":true,"question":"Ecosystem Contribution: How does your project complement existing initiatives in the GoodDollar ecosystem rather than competing with them?","questionId":6},{"type":"dropdown","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Ethical Compliance: Confirm you have read and will comply with the ethical standards outlined in the eligibility criteria.","questionId":7},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Additional Information\nScalability Potential:\nThe project is designed for scalability, allowing us to replicate the model in other regions to broaden its impact.\nTechnology Stack:\nWe will use Vite, React, and TypeScript to ensure a responsive and efficient user experience, facilitating easy updates.\nData Privacy and Security:\nUser data privacy is a priority, with robust protections in place to ensure safe engagement.\nLong-Term Vision:\nOur goal is to foster a culture of sustainability within the GoodDollar community, promoting lasting behavioral changes.\nFeedback Mechanisms:\nContinuous feedback will be collected to refine the project based on user experiences, enhancing satisfaction over time.","hidden":true,"question":"Additional Info: Is there anything else critical for evaluating your project that wasn't covered in the questions above?","questionId":8}],"project":{"id":"0x3aff58fa56f020ee073d4faa81e1f790b25a5b9c8aaf9ae5a9894b0a9b31a222","title":"Carus Recycling","logoImg":"bafkreidtc3mmcc6saynypjfjc5g7tuma2c6tp4tacxe3kuoxvntlizmvhy","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreigcqyk6eazrddzsm7sfs3ybgxwsfhq4whnn2bpujkxblxgpoohtoa","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://www.carusrecycling.com","bannerImg":"bafkreifnnbqbkn7ici53diolirph7hcu73laz3iebiznvg7nwc234fppaa","createdAt":1743889423775,"userGithub":"Abduliscode","credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-04-05T21:43:29.141Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0x0721aa29baab657a1c13af127e201ea1c139bdac1cecac78582e155bec3eda016a188fd422443078a4c61feb0c79a5184d3e6fbc0f9f0e54117b579d08ff61c41b","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-04-05T21:43:29.140Z","expirationDate":"2025-07-04T21:43:29.140Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x9BbaCc2f9f4C10A63383cB9ca204Cbd4E977ab6e","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#recycleoncarus","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:wq6MBnrRK+WgMRms1c75ZKdrOeU+F+hNmTtUhFcpEJY="]}}},"description":"Project Description: Carus Recycling Initiative\nOverview\nThe Carus Recycling Initiative is a community-driven project aimed at transforming plastic waste management through innovative technology and engagement strategies.

Dollar’s Infinite Fountain (by ForkinWisdom)**  Gamifying GoodDollar’s Ecosystem and Community Growth\n\n\\-\n\nWe are building a dApp that gamifies capital allocation for the GoodDollar Ecosystem, uniting communities to support community efforts that drive its growth and impact.\n\n**50% of this grant** will be sent directly to empower community members by funding four dedicated pools (tracks) for anyone eager to strengthen the ecosystem.\n\n\\-\n\nHere are some [VideoWalkthroughs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbDrTOUCBhsNIOXklaYvnqmExk85aX-GGC-yqd4iKXs/edit?usp=sharing) of the dApp (WIP)\n\n\\-\n\nWe will create 4 strategic pools (tracks):\n\n**Mutual Aid, Cooperatives, and Micro-Credit:**  \nThis track empowers grassroots initiatives by providing financial support and resources for community-based aid, cooperative projects, and micro-credit programs—all designed to strengthen local economies within the GoodDollar Ecosystem.\n\n**Marketplace Booster:**  \nFocused on driving economic activity, this pool incentivizes users to buy, sell, and exchange services with the G$ token, creating a self-sustaining marketplace that enhances token utility and fosters vibrant commercial interactions.\n\n**Community Onboarding:**  \nThis track accelerates ecosystem growth by encouraging new users to join GoodDollar. It offers incentives for buying G$ tokens, exploring the diverse tools, and actively engaging in the community, ensuring a seamless and welcoming introduction to the platform.\n\n**Marketing and Meme Culture:**  \nHarnessing the power of creative content and community-driven promotion, this pool leverages innovative marketing strategies and meme culture to boost brand visibility, engage a broader audience, and drive the overall adoption of GoodDollar.\n\n\\-\n\nWe will leverage the Superfluid Protocol and the G$ super token to continuously stream funds, opening the \"floodgates\" of our main Fountain and dynamically distributing resources to each dedicated pool and its members in real time.\n\nThanks to this fluid capital allocation system, we can constantly adjust flow rates and percentages to reflect community performance, sentiment and evolving needs, ensuring a funding model that it’s transparent, flexible, and continuously evolving.\n\nTo further energize participation, every pool will feature an engaging leaderboard that gamifies the experience and encourages participants to excel in their contributions, earn competitive rewards, and drive the overall success of their pool.\n\n\\-\n\n**But why do we use the word “Infinite” ?**\n\nTraditional funding models that rely solely on one-off giveaways lack sustainability and fail to deliver any real return on investment. In our approach, each pool is designed with clear KPIs focused on generating ROI, ensuring that every initiative not only sustains itself but also adds value back to the main pool.\n\nBy reinvesting returns into the Infinite Fountain, we create a perpetual funding cycle that drives growth and encourages a mindset of sustainable investment. This model transforms funding into a renewable endeavor—one that continually strengthens the GoodDollar Ecosystem while ensuring that resources are consistently reinvested and never exhausted.  \n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Infinite-Fountain","projectTwitter":"forkinwisdom"},"metadataCid":"bafkreig6ze4mrxqs4ptnnupm5mvmxcqwr7czqvb3lye56gydxkcc4adjta","timestamp":"2025-03-31T21:51:54+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xA7C6a8782632733d48246bF516475341Dac6d65B","createdAtBlock":31557156}],"projectId":"0xbc9aeaf606a3200c751eee2bcdcd91d604ed2eb8172fdd68255375648c83df76","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"29","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-31T23:11:55.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31561957"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2025-04-02T07:34:25.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31678507"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-02T07:39:16.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31678798"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32200158,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-31T23:11:55+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x1c9570FCf3BE33D4CD805cc8b2a5Bc690494c8BD","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31685284,"createdByAddress":"0xa1599790B763E537bd15b5b912012e5Fb65491a3","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"26","metadata":{"signature":"0x26637ff458c250e642da1f4bea1afb8db7999be0f5eefbe92f9d9de369fa39de4bc384152b47487fa3f298c673943bfc1fc48bce33f9765fc60659448ea0e08f1c","application":{"round":"0x3aA3C6cc0004b7366A12b8E4262015AF525531a9","answers":[{"type":"short-answer","answer":"CeloSubPay is a decentralized subscription payment protocol designed to enable automated recurring payments using stablecoins like cUSD and cEUR on the Celo blockchain.

Liminal Commons addresses the failure of current digital platforms to support deep connection, collaboration, and purpose-driven work for transformative communities (the \"Liminal Network\"). We are building the essential administrative state and coordination layer for this emerging network society – not just another social app, but foundational infrastructure. Using a unique \"field-based\" design philosophy and intelligent AI agents, we cultivate digital environments where meaningful relationships flourish and collaborative creation thrives.  Our core function is service: enabling members to find each other, navigate the \"meaning economy,\" develop their unique gifts, and work together effectively. To achieve this, Liminal Commons requires a native, value-aligned currency. GoodDollar (G$) is that currency. We will integrate G$ as the lifeblood of our internal ecosystem for:  Distributing Grants: Directly funding projects and individuals within the network. Powering Micro-transactions: Rewarding participation, enabling tipping, and facilitating access. Facilitating Value Exchange: Experimenting with gift, commons-based, and contribution economies.  By integrating G$, Liminal Commons provides a crucial new dimension of utility for the token – moving beyond basic needs into supporting transformation, collaboration, and purpose.

UGANDA is a community-led NGO that trains rural farmers on regenerative agriculture, promotes agroforestry, and restores natural ecosystems in Eastern Uganda. With a proven track record of training 1,213 rural women & farmers, planting 45,000+ fruit trees, and restoring 10 wetlands\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA aims to revolutionize financial inclusion for rural women in Tororo district through a blockchain-based microfinance system integrated with the $G Ecosystem. This initiative will create a secure community currency, enable micropayments with minimal fees, and establish digital financial identities for 2,000 previously underbanked women across 100 savings groups. By leveraging Web3 technology and the $G token infrastructure, the project addresses critical barriers to rural financial inclusion while preserving traditional savings group practices. The system will reduce transaction costs by 75%, increase savings rates by 40%, and stimulate local economic development through an integrated merchant network—ultimately creating a sustainable, community-owned financial infrastructure that extends the reach and impact of the $G Ecosystem to marginalized rural communities.\n\nProject Background\nAYOWECCA UGANDA has established a robust presence in eastern Uganda, implementing community development programs with a focus on women's economic empowerment. Despite Uganda's growing adoption of mobile money services, rural women in Tororo remain largely excluded from formal financial services, relying instead on traditional Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). These groups, while culturally appropriate and trusted, operate with limited security, inefficient record-keeping, and restricted growth potential.\nThe emergence of the $G Ecosystem presents a unique opportunity to bridge this gap by providing tokenized value transfer specifically designed for underserved communities. AYOWECCA's trusted relationships with 78 women's savings groups across Tororo create an ideal foundation for introducing blockchain technology in a contextually appropriate manner. Recent pilot initiatives have demonstrated both the technical feasibility of implementing such systems in rural environments and the willingness of women's groups to adopt digital solutions when designed with their specific needs in mind.\n\n![womentraining](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_20240604_162002_143-768x576.jpg)\n\nProblem Statement\nRural women's savings groups in Tororo face multifaceted challenges that perpetuate financial exclusion:\n\nGeographic Isolation: Most group members live 20+ kilometers from the nearest formal financial institution, making regular banking interactions impractical\nProhibitive Transaction Costs: Fees for small-value transfers can reach 10-15% through traditional channels, making micropayments economically unfeasible\nCash Security Risks: Physical cash management exposes groups to theft, loss, and misappropriation, undermining trust and sustainability\nLimited Recordkeeping: Paper-based systems prone to errors, manipulation, and loss create disputes and erode confidence within groups\nInvisible Financial Histories: Despite years of reliable participation in savings activities, women cannot leverage this history to access formal credit\nEconomic Insularity: Difficulties connecting local production to broader markets limit income generation potential\nLiquidity Constraints: Cash-based systems create delays in loan disbursements and limit emergency fund accessibility\n\nThese challenges disproportionately affect women, who constitute 67% of Tororo's agricultural workforce but control only 23% of productive assets, contributing to persistent gender-based economic disparities and limiting community resilience.\n\nProposed Solution\nAYOWECCA UGANDA will implement a comprehensive blockchain-based financial ecosystem integrated with the $G infrastructure:\n\n$G-Backed Local Token: A community currency for Tororo, backed by the $G token, enabling stable, low-cost transactions within and eventually between communities\nMobile-First Application: User interface optimized for basic smartphones with offline transaction capability and USSD fallback for feature phone access\nSelf-Sovereign Identity System: Digital identity solution allowing women to establish verifiable financial reputations irrespective of formal documentation\nBlockchain-Powered VSLAs: Smart contract implementation of traditional savings groups with automated record-keeping, transparent governance, and programmable distribution rules\nLocal Merchant Network: Integration platform enabling businesses to participate in the digital ecosystem and connect with savings group members\nFinancial Education Layer: Contextually appropriate learning modules delivered through the application in local languages\nCross-Chain Integration: Infrastructure to connect with the broader $G Ecosystem, enabling eventual participation in global economic opportunities\n\nThe technical architecture will leverage the Celo blockchain for its mobile-first design and low transaction costs, with bridges to the $G token ecosystem to ensure interoperability and value preservation.\n\n![empoweringwomen](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699765141925.png)\n\nProject Goals and Objectives\nPrimary Goal\nCreate an inclusive, sustainable blockchain-based financial ecosystem that empowers rural women's savings groups in Tororo while expanding the reach and impact of the $G Ecosystem to underserved communities.\nSpecific Objectives\n\nOnboard 2,000 women from 100 savings groups to the platform within 18 months\nReduce transaction costs by 75% compared to existing alternatives\nIncrease average savings rates by 40% through improved accessibility and trust\nFacilitate 500 microloans through the platform with 95%+ repayment rate\nIntegrate 50 local merchants into the community currency ecosystem\nTrain 100 community blockchain ambassadors (70% women) to provide ongoing support\nAchieve 80% user satisfaction rate among participants\nEstablish 5 financial inclusion hubs for training and technical support\nCreate a replicable model for $G Ecosystem expansion in rural contexts\n\nWhy This Project Is the Best Approach\nThis blockchain-based approach represents the optimal solution for Tororo's rural women for several critical reasons:\n\nContextual Appropriateness: Unlike traditional banking solutions that require substantial infrastructure, this mobile-first approach works within existing constraints while creating pathways for future growth.\nCommunity Sovereignty: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology preserves the autonomous, member-owned structure of traditional savings groups, enhancing functionality without compromising cultural values.\nEconomic Efficiency: Blockchain dramatically reduces transaction costs compared to both traditional banking and mobile money options, making previously unprofitable micropayments viable.\nTransparency and Trust: The immutable, verifiable transaction record addresses trust issues that frequently undermine group savings initiatives and provides accountability.\nFinancial Identity Solution: The self-sovereign identity component solves the fundamental challenge of financial inclusion for women without formal documentation or credit histories.\nTechnical Resilience: The hybrid online/offline design ensures functionality even in areas with limited connectivity—a critical consideration for rural implementation.\n$G Ecosystem Expansion: By connecting rural communities to the $G token infrastructure, this project creates a replicable model for extending blockchain benefits to marginalized populations globally.\n\nAlternative approaches considered—including traditional microfinance, centralized mobile banking, and paper-based record improvement—all fail to address the full spectrum of challenges or require prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments.\nWhy AYOWECCA UGANDA Needs This Funding\nAYOWECCA UGANDA requires this funding to bridge the critical gap between promising blockchain technology and meaningful implementation in challenging rural settings:\n\nTechnical Development Costs: Customizing blockchain solutions for low-resource environments requires specialized expertise that must be contracted externally during initial development.\nLast-Mile Infrastructure: While building on existing mobile networks, the project must establish community hubs with reliable power and internet to serve as synchronization points.\nIntensive Training Requirements: Effective adoption requires sustained, hands-on training investments that exceed the organization's current capacity.\nRegulatory Navigation: Establishing compliant operations within Uganda's evolving blockchain regulatory framework requires legal expertise and government engagement.\n$G Integration Development: Creating secure, user-friendly bridges between local community currencies and the broader $G Ecosystem requires additional technical resources.\nImpact Evaluation Investment: Documenting outcomes with statistical validity requires investment in comprehensive data collection and analysis to create an evidence base for further expansion.\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA brings considerable in-kind contributions to this project, including established community relationships, local staff, and organizational infrastructure. However, the technical requirements and scale of this initiative exceed current financial capacity. This funding will catalyze a self-sustaining system that, once established, can operate with minimal ongoing external support while demonstrating a viable model for $G Ecosystem expansion in similar contexts worldwide.\nMethodology\nThe project will employ a participatory, phased methodology with four key components:\n\nHuman-Centered Design Process:\n\nCollaborative design workshops with savings group representatives\nIterative prototyping with continuous user feedback\nContextual inquiry to understand existing financial practices\nAccessibility testing with diverse user groups (varying

UGANDA is a community-led NGO that trains rural farmers on regenerative agriculture, promotes agroforestry, and restores natural ecosystems in Eastern Uganda. With a proven track record of training 1,213 rural women & farmers, planting 45,000+ fruit trees, and restoring 10 wetlands\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA aims to revolutionize financial inclusion for rural women in Tororo district through a blockchain-based microfinance system integrated with the $G Ecosystem. This initiative will create a secure community currency, enable micropayments with minimal fees, and establish digital financial identities for 2,000 previously underbanked women across 100 savings groups. By leveraging Web3 technology and the $G token infrastructure, the project addresses critical barriers to rural financial inclusion while preserving traditional savings group practices. The system will reduce transaction costs by 75%, increase savings rates by 40%, and stimulate local economic development through an integrated merchant network—ultimately creating a sustainable, community-owned financial infrastructure that extends the reach and impact of the $G Ecosystem to marginalized rural communities.\n\nProject Background\nAYOWECCA UGANDA has established a robust presence in eastern Uganda, implementing community development programs with a focus on women's economic empowerment. Despite Uganda's growing adoption of mobile money services, rural women in Tororo remain largely excluded from formal financial services, relying instead on traditional Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). These groups, while culturally appropriate and trusted, operate with limited security, inefficient record-keeping, and restricted growth potential.\nThe emergence of the $G Ecosystem presents a unique opportunity to bridge this gap by providing tokenized value transfer specifically designed for underserved communities. AYOWECCA's trusted relationships with 78 women's savings groups across Tororo create an ideal foundation for introducing blockchain technology in a contextually appropriate manner. Recent pilot initiatives have demonstrated both the technical feasibility of implementing such systems in rural environments and the willingness of women's groups to adopt digital solutions when designed with their specific needs in mind.\n\n![womentraining](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_20240604_162002_143-768x576.jpg)\n\nProblem Statement\nRural women's savings groups in Tororo face multifaceted challenges that perpetuate financial exclusion:\n\nGeographic Isolation: Most group members live 20+ kilometers from the nearest formal financial institution, making regular banking interactions impractical\nProhibitive Transaction Costs: Fees for small-value transfers can reach 10-15% through traditional channels, making micropayments economically unfeasible\nCash Security Risks: Physical cash management exposes groups to theft, loss, and misappropriation, undermining trust and sustainability\nLimited Recordkeeping: Paper-based systems prone to errors, manipulation, and loss create disputes and erode confidence within groups\nInvisible Financial Histories: Despite years of reliable participation in savings activities, women cannot leverage this history to access formal credit\nEconomic Insularity: Difficulties connecting local production to broader markets limit income generation potential\nLiquidity Constraints: Cash-based systems create delays in loan disbursements and limit emergency fund accessibility\n\nThese challenges disproportionately affect women, who constitute 67% of Tororo's agricultural workforce but control only 23% of productive assets, contributing to persistent gender-based economic disparities and limiting community resilience.\n\nProposed Solution\nAYOWECCA UGANDA will implement a comprehensive blockchain-based financial ecosystem integrated with the $G infrastructure:\n\n$G-Backed Local Token: A community currency for Tororo, backed by the $G token, enabling stable, low-cost transactions within and eventually between communities\nMobile-First Application: User interface optimized for basic smartphones with offline transaction capability and USSD fallback for feature phone access\nSelf-Sovereign Identity System: Digital identity solution allowing women to establish verifiable financial reputations irrespective of formal documentation\nBlockchain-Powered VSLAs: Smart contract implementation of traditional savings groups with automated record-keeping, transparent governance, and programmable distribution rules\nLocal Merchant Network: Integration platform enabling businesses to participate in the digital ecosystem and connect with savings group members\nFinancial Education Layer: Contextually appropriate learning modules delivered through the application in local languages\nCross-Chain Integration: Infrastructure to connect with the broader $G Ecosystem, enabling eventual participation in global economic opportunities\n\nThe technical architecture will leverage the Celo blockchain for its mobile-first design and low transaction costs, with bridges to the $G token ecosystem to ensure interoperability and value preservation.\n\n![empoweringwomen](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699765141925.png)\n\nProject Goals and Objectives\nPrimary Goal\nCreate an inclusive, sustainable blockchain-based financial ecosystem that empowers rural women's savings groups in Tororo while expanding the reach and impact of the $G Ecosystem to underserved communities.\nSpecific Objectives\n\nOnboard 2,000 women from 100 savings groups to the platform within 18 months\nReduce transaction costs by 75% compared to existing alternatives\nIncrease average savings rates by 40% through improved accessibility and trust\nFacilitate 500 microloans through the platform with 95%+ repayment rate\nIntegrate 50 local merchants into the community currency ecosystem\nTrain 100 community blockchain ambassadors (70% women) to provide ongoing support\nAchieve 80% user satisfaction rate among participants\nEstablish 5 financial inclusion hubs for training and technical support\nCreate a replicable model for $G Ecosystem expansion in rural contexts\n\nWhy This Project Is the Best Approach\nThis blockchain-based approach represents the optimal solution for Tororo's rural women for several critical reasons:\n\nContextual Appropriateness: Unlike traditional banking solutions that require substantial infrastructure, this mobile-first approach works within existing constraints while creating pathways for future growth.\nCommunity Sovereignty: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology preserves the autonomous, member-owned structure of traditional savings groups, enhancing functionality without compromising cultural values.\nEconomic Efficiency: Blockchain dramatically reduces transaction costs compared to both traditional banking and mobile money options, making previously unprofitable micropayments viable.\nTransparency and Trust: The immutable, verifiable transaction record addresses trust issues that frequently undermine group savings initiatives and provides accountability.\nFinancial Identity Solution: The self-sovereign identity component solves the fundamental challenge of financial inclusion for women without formal documentation or credit histories.\nTechnical Resilience: The hybrid online/offline design ensures functionality even in areas with limited connectivity—a critical consideration for rural implementation.\n$G Ecosystem Expansion: By connecting rural communities to the $G token infrastructure, this project creates a replicable model for extending blockchain benefits to marginalized populations globally.\n\nAlternative approaches considered—including traditional microfinance, centralized mobile banking, and paper-based record improvement—all fail to address the full spectrum of challenges or require prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments.\nWhy AYOWECCA UGANDA Needs This Funding\nAYOWECCA UGANDA requires this funding to bridge the critical gap between promising blockchain technology and meaningful implementation in challenging rural settings:\n\nTechnical Development Costs: Customizing blockchain solutions for low-resource environments requires specialized expertise that must be contracted externally during initial development.\nLast-Mile Infrastructure: While building on existing mobile networks, the project must establish community hubs with reliable power and internet to serve as synchronization points.\nIntensive Training Requirements: Effective adoption requires sustained, hands-on training investments that exceed the organization's current capacity.\nRegulatory Navigation: Establishing compliant operations within Uganda's evolving blockchain regulatory framework requires legal expertise and government engagement.\n$G Integration Development: Creating secure, user-friendly bridges between local community currencies and the broader $G Ecosystem requires additional technical resources.\nImpact Evaluation Investment: Documenting outcomes with statistical validity requires investment in comprehensive data collection and analysis to create an evidence base for further expansion.\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA brings considerable in-kind contributions to this project, including established community relationships, local staff, and organizational infrastructure. However, the technical requirements and scale of this initiative exceed current financial capacity. This funding will catalyze a self-sustaining system that, once established, can operate with minimal ongoing external support while demonstrating a viable model for $G Ecosystem expansion in similar contexts worldwide.\nMethodology\nThe project will employ a participatory, phased methodology with four key components:\n\nHuman-Centered Design Process:\n\nCollaborative design workshops with savings

This also means that there are missed opportunities to create more composability to staked $G such as single-sided liquidity provisions.\n\nLastly, there's a lack of long-term commitment. Users frequently stake for short periods or exit due to insufficient rewards and engagement incentives. This is different from “set-and-forget it” users, as there isn’t a sufficient incentive for them to continue utilising the platform, which also affects them being involved in supporting the broader GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\nWithout addressing these challenges, GoodDAO risks reduced decentralisation, inefficient governance, and financial instability within the GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\nSolution: GoodGov incentivises users to stake $G for longer durations and actively participate in governance through:\n\nWith a tiered rewards model, sers earn variable rewards based on their level of participation in governance activities, incentivizing consistent and meaningful engagement. Higher tiers offer greater rewards, encouraging users to contribute more actively over time. This model ensures long-term retention by aligning user interests with the platform’s growth and stability.\n\nThe use of onchain reputation tracking means GoodGov can have transparent, immutable tracking and quantify user contributions to governance, such as voting, proposals, and community engagement. Reputation scores evolve based on the quality and frequency of participation, ensuring fair recognition. This mechanism helps distinguish committed stakeholders from passive holders, fostering a meritocratic ecosystem.\n\nThe use of gvernance-linked staking with $G tokens, enable users to earn additional rewards proportional to their involvement. The more a user engages in voting and decision-making, the higher their staking rewards, creating a direct incentive for active participation. This system ensures that stakeholders are financially aligned with the platform’s success while discouraging passive holding.\n\nA secure, tamper-proof voting system ensures that all governance decisions are transparent and verifiable on-chain. Voting power is weighted by reputation and staking commitment, preventing manipulation by large token holders. This democratic approach guarantees that key decisions reflect the collective will of the most engaged and invested community members.\n\nIntegration of interactive dashboards provide real-time insights into governance proposals, voting trends, and user contributions, making participation more accessible. Our learning modules and tutorials educate users on governance processes, lowering the barrier to entry for newcomers. These tools foster an informed and engaged community, driving higher participation rates and better decision-making.\n\nKey Features:\n\nA. Staking & Rewards System: Users stake $G for predefined durations. The rewards that are distributed to users, increase based on staking duration, participation in governance and other metrics too. With automated smart contract execution it ensures fair distribution of staking yields.\n\nB. Governance Participation Incentives: This can evolve into stakers receiving weighted voting power based on reputation and staking amount. Users who consistently vote, propose changes, and contribute to governance gain higher influence. The rewards will be adjusted based on engagement levels.\n\nC. On-Chain Reputation Tracking: Users build a Reputation Score based on governance activity and staking history. Higher reputation unlocks governance privileges and additional rewards.\n\nD.

This also means that there are missed opportunities to create more composability to staked $G such as single-sided liquidity provisions.\n\nLastly, there's a lack of long-term commitment. Users frequently stake for short periods or exit due to insufficient rewards and engagement incentives. This is different from “set-and-forget it” users, as there isn’t a sufficient incentive for them to continue utilising the platform, which also affects them being involved in supporting the broader GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\nWithout addressing these challenges, GoodDAO risks reduced decentralisation, inefficient governance, and financial instability within the GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\nSolution: GoodGov incentivises users to stake $G for longer durations and actively participate in governance through:\n\nWith a tiered rewards model, sers earn variable rewards based on their level of participation in governance activities, incentivizing consistent and meaningful engagement. Higher tiers offer greater rewards, encouraging users to contribute more actively over time. This model ensures long-term retention by aligning user interests with the platform’s growth and stability.\n\nThe use of onchain reputation tracking means GoodGov can have transparent, immutable tracking and quantify user contributions to governance, such as voting, proposals, and community engagement. Reputation scores evolve based on the quality and frequency of participation, ensuring fair recognition. This mechanism helps distinguish committed stakeholders from passive holders, fostering a meritocratic ecosystem.\n\nThe use of gvernance-linked staking with $G tokens, enable users to earn additional rewards proportional to their involvement. The more a user engages in voting and decision-making, the higher their staking rewards, creating a direct incentive for active participation. This system ensures that stakeholders are financially aligned with the platform’s success while discouraging passive holding.\n\nA secure, tamper-proof voting system ensures that all governance decisions are transparent and verifiable on-chain. Voting power is weighted by reputation and staking commitment, preventing manipulation by large token holders. This democratic approach guarantees that key decisions reflect the collective will of the most engaged and invested community members.\n\nIntegration of interactive dashboards provide real-time insights into governance proposals, voting trends, and user contributions, making participation more accessible. Our learning modules and tutorials educate users on governance processes, lowering the barrier to entry for newcomers. These tools foster an informed and engaged community, driving higher participation rates and better decision-making.\n\nKey Features:\n\nA. Staking & Rewards System: Users stake $G for predefined durations. The rewards that are distributed to users, increase based on staking duration, participation in governance and other metrics too. With automated smart contract execution it ensures fair distribution of staking yields.\n\nB. Governance Participation Incentives: This can evolve into stakers receiving weighted voting power based on reputation and staking amount. Users who consistently vote, propose changes, and contribute to governance gain higher influence. The rewards will be adjusted based on engagement levels.\n\nC. On-Chain Reputation Tracking: Users build a Reputation Score based on governance activity and staking history. Higher reputation unlocks governance privileges and additional rewards.\n\nD. Decentralised Voting & Proposal Mechanism: Token holders can submit proposals on key decisions. The reputation and staking volume of the user influences voting power. The eventual voting results are stored on-chain for transparency.\n\nE. User-Friendly dApp Interface: Intuitive UI for staking, governance participation, and tracking rewards. Live analytics to showcase governance impact\n\nExpected Impact: GoodGov transforms GoodDollar into a more decentralised, participatory, and resilient ecosystem. \n\nIncreased governance participation

proposal outlines the creation of a GoodDollar-Cubid SDK, a permissionless, open-source toolkit that enables any web2 or web3 application to integrate GoodDollar’s daily claim flow with minimal effort.  By combining Cubid’s embedded wallet system with GoodDollar’s FaceVerification SDK and Claim Button, this SDK makes it simple for developers to add a full end-to-end claiming experience — including wallet creation, identity verification, and daily UBI access — to their websites or applications with just a few lines of code.  This project will significantly lower the barrier to entry for users, especially those new to web3 or without existing wallets, and increase the reach of GoodDollar’s mission across both traditional and decentralized platforms.","hidden":true,"question":"Project Description: Briefly describe your project and how it enhances G$ utility or adoption","questionId":0},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"New GoodDollar-Cubid SDK\nWill merge three SDKs and make one new SDK:\nCubid’s Embedded Wallet SDK\nGoodDollar’s FaceVerification SDK\nGoodDollar’s Claim Button\nCan be used as:\nA UI component with 3 states:\nNot connected: connect or click to create a wallet\nConnected but not verified: click to verify\nConnected and verified: click to claim\nAn API for more advanced or custom integrations\nDrop-in UI component will ship with fixed styling initially\ndevelopers can fork and customize if needed\ndevelopers can pull-request their open-source contributions\n","hidden":true,"question":"Technical Implementation: Describe your approach and how it integrates with GoodDollar.

Overview\n\nThis proposal outlines the creation of a **GoodDollar-Cubid SDK**, a permissionless, open-source toolkit that enables **any web2 or web3 application to integrate GoodDollar’s daily claim flow** with minimal effort.\n\nBy combining Cubid’s embedded wallet system with GoodDollar’s FaceVerification SDK and Claim Button, this SDK makes it simple for developers to add a full end-to-end claiming experience — including wallet creation, identity verification, and daily UBI access — to their websites or applications with just a few lines of code.\n\nThis project will significantly lower the barrier to entry for users, especially those new to web3 or without existing wallets, and increase the reach of GoodDollar’s mission across both traditional and decentralized platforms.\n\n---\n\n# 2\\. Objective\n\nImagine this:  \n*A user visits a regular website where they log in like normal—maybe it's a news site, a community hub, or a learning platform. A small widget appears, inviting them to claim free digital income. With a single tap, they create a secure wallet, seamlessly protected by their phone’s fingerprint or Face ID—no seed phrases, no confusing backup steps. They verify their identity in under a minute using face verification, and immediately after, they click once more to claim their first GoodDollar. In under two minutes, they’ve joined the web3 economy—without downloads, extensions, or crypto knowledge. Just a browser, a tap, and a human face.*\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a **modular, embeddable SDK** that offers the following capabilities:\n\n- **Embedded wallet creation and management** via Cubid’s secure wallet SDK  \n- **Face verification** via GoodDollar’s FaceVerification SDK  \n- **Daily UBI claim functionality** via the GoodDollar Claim Button\n\nThis SDK will be:\n\n- **Open-source**  \n- **Permissionless to use**  \n- **Available as both a UI component and API**  \n- **Designed for quick integration with a few lines of code**\n\nDevelopers will be able to:\n\n- Choose between their already connected wallet, or connect an external wallet, or allow users to create a Cubid-powered embedded wallet without leaving their website.  \n- Select between a UI-based experience or integrate the logic programmatically via the API  \n- Embed the daily claim flow anywhere – from DeFi dashboards and DAO portals to news sites, games, or educational apps  \n- Give users the ability to export their private key for use in any other 3rd party wallet\n\n---\n\n# 3\\. Core Use Cases\n\n### For Developers of Web2 Sites\n\nThe SDK is especially valuable for web2 developers who want to introduce users to web3 without requiring the complexity of private key management or wallet onboarding. The Cubid wallet uses **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** to split and securely store wallet keys, eliminating the need for users to save seed phrases.\n\n### For Web3 Apps and DAOs\n\nFor apps that already support wallet connections, the SDK makes it trivial to plug in a daily GoodDollar claim flow, providing an incentive loop and deeper engagement with users.\n\n### For Onboarding the Unbanked\n\nOne of the most important targeted use cases is **using GoodDollar as the first “on-chain” asset** a user receives. The SDK makes it possible for DeFi and learning platforms to let new users claim GoodDollars and use them as an entry point to on-chain education and financial tools — all without requiring upfront capital or knowledge of crypto infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n# 4\\. Technical Approach\n\n### Cubid Embedded Wallet SDK (done\\!)\n\n- Built on **Next.js**  \n- Supports WalletConnect, RainbowKit, and **non-custodial embedded wallet creation**  \n- Wallets use **2-of-3 Shamir Secret Sharing**: one share stored on device, one encrypted and sent to the app, and one stored securely with Cubid's secret manager  \n- App-scoped Cubid identity is created alongside the wallet\n\n### New GoodDollar-Cubid SDK\n\n- Will merge three SDKs and make one new SDK:  \n  - Cubid’s Embedded Wallet SDK  \n  - GoodDollar’s FaceVerification SDK  \n  - GoodDollar’s Claim Button  \n- Can be used as:  \n  - A **UI component** with 3 states:  \n    1. Not connected: connect or click to create a wallet  \n    2. Connected but not verified: click to verify  \n    3. Connected and verified: click to claim  \n  - An **API** for more advanced or custom integrations  \n- Drop-in UI component will ship with fixed styling initially  \n  - developers can fork and customize if needed  \n  - developers can pull-request their open-source contributions\n\n### Handling Sessions and Identity\n\n- Each app/site creates its own scoped Cubid identity and wallet  \n- The SDK does not implement universal login, but developers can manage sessions and identity on their end  \n- Private key recovery is handled by guiding users to retrieve the third secret by logging into Cubid with the same credentials used for the original wallet\n\n### Gas & Claiming\n\n- The claim process does require gas and signing  \n- GoodDollar typically funds accounts with enough gas to claim, which we assume will continue  \n- The SDK will **not implement meta-transactions or gas abstraction** at this stage  \n- Coordination with GoodDollar may be needed to ensure newly created wallets can claim\n\n---\n\n## 5\\. Project Timeline\n\n**Estimated Build Time: 2–3 months**\n\nThe work will be led by the **core Cubid team**, with openness to collaborating with community contributors.\n\n---\n\n# 5\\. Ecosystem Impact\n\nThe GoodDollar-Cubid SDK significantly scales GoodDollar’s mission by:\n\n- Enabling **frictionless access to UBI** from anywhere on the internet  \n- Empowering **developers to add GoodDollar into diverse digital spaces** with minimal effort  \n- Supporting **walletless onboarding** with no seed phrases or crypto experience required  \n- Encouraging 100s of integrations across web2 and web3 platforms  \n- Laying the foundation for scalable identity and inclusion across DeFi, DAOs, and more\n\nCubid will track SDK adoption across sites and developers, but **will not track individual GoodDollar claim events** unless specifically requested. If needed, we can provide GoodDollar with reports on adoption trends and technical feedback.\n\nWe will also publish full documentation and guides on the Cubid site. We are also open to support publishing the same on GoodDollars site, making it easier for developers to discover, integrate, and contribute to the SDK. While Cubid will seed initial promotion, broader marketing efforts such as hackathons or bounty programs are expected to be led by the GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n# 6\\. Funding Request\n\nThis proposal is submitted to the **Gitcoin x GoodDollar Builders Program Quadratic Funding Round**, as part of the kickoff phase to grow the GoodDollar ecosystem through real-world utility, developer tooling, and ecosystem expansion.\n\nThe **GoodDollar-Cubid SDK** directly aligns with the round’s goals by enabling seamless, embeddable access to GoodDollar’s daily claim flow across both **web2 and web3 applications**. By combining wallet creation, face verification, and daily claiming into a single developer-friendly SDK, this project will:\n\n- **Enhance G$ utility** by making it accessible from anywhere online  \n- **Support real-world adoption** by onboarding users who don’t yet have wallets or technical knowledge  \n- **Empower builders** with an open-source integration layer that lowers the barrier to working with G$  \n- **Strengthen the GoodDollar ecosystem** through increased visibility, usage, and composability of the protocol\n\nWe’re seeking support from the community and matching partners to fund approximately **2–3 months of full-time development**, including:\n\n- SDK architecture and buildout  \n- UI component design and implementation  \n- Wallet integration and identity handling  \n- Documentation and developer onboarding  \n- Testing, iteration, and optional early adopter collaborations\n\nThe project will be developed by the **core Cubid team**, with a commitment to open-source licensing, transparency, and community engagement. We are not requesting a fixed amount, but are participating fully in the spirit of **quadratic funding**—leaning on the community’s belief in this tool’s potential to unlock greater impact for the entire G$ ecosystem.\n\nBy funding this SDK, you’re helping make GoodDollar as easy to integrate as Google Maps—and just as ubiquitous.\n\n---\n\n# 7\\. In Closing\n\nOur intention is to transparently document and share the value of this work, and make it available as an **open-sourced public good** for the benefit of the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe GoodDollar-Cubid SDK is a natural evolution of both platforms' missions: **accessible identity, permissionless finance,** and **inclusive tools that lower barriers to entry.** By making it easy to claim GoodDollars from anywhere, we unlock real utility, drive adoption, and bring the next wave of users into web3 — one line of code at a time.\n\nWe’re excited to build this and look forward to collaborating with the GoodDollar team and community.","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"Cubid-Me","projectTwitter":"CubidProtocol"},"recipient":"0xB4bf0F23c702EFB8a9da87A94095e28dE3D21Cc3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreigcqyqdqvbx2uams3goiz3vhpfaxosq3mjwfrahjytrh4lwctv2we","projects":[{"name":"GoodDollar-Cubid

Connected and verified: click to claim  \n  - An **API** for more advanced or custom integrations  \n- Drop-in UI component will ship with fixed styling initially  \n  - developers can fork and customize if needed  \n  - developers can pull-request their open-source contributions\n\n### Handling Sessions and Identity\n\n- Each app/site creates its own scoped Cubid identity and wallet  \n- The SDK does not implement universal login, but developers can manage sessions and identity on their end  \n- Private key recovery is handled by guiding users to retrieve the third secret by logging into Cubid with the same credentials used for the original wallet\n\n### Gas & Claiming\n\n- The claim process does require gas and signing  \n- GoodDollar typically funds accounts with enough gas to claim, which we assume will continue  \n- The SDK will **not implement meta-transactions or gas abstraction** at this stage  \n- Coordination with GoodDollar may be needed to ensure newly created wallets can claim\n\n---\n\n## 5\\. Project Timeline\n\n**Estimated Build Time: 2–3 months**\n\nThe work will be led by the **core Cubid team**, with openness to collaborating with community contributors.\n\n---\n\n# 5\\. Ecosystem Impact\n\nThe GoodDollar-Cubid SDK significantly scales GoodDollar’s mission by:\n\n- Enabling **frictionless access to UBI** from anywhere on the internet  \n- Empowering **developers to add GoodDollar into diverse digital spaces** with minimal effort  \n- Supporting **walletless onboarding** with no seed phrases or crypto experience required  \n- Encouraging 100s of integrations across web2 and web3 platforms  \n- Laying the foundation for scalable identity and inclusion across DeFi, DAOs, and more\n\nCubid will track SDK adoption across sites and developers, but **will not track individual GoodDollar claim events** unless specifically requested. If needed, we can provide GoodDollar with reports on adoption trends and technical feedback.\n\nWe will also publish full documentation and guides on the Cubid site. We are also open to support publishing the same on GoodDollars site, making it easier for developers to discover, integrate, and contribute to the SDK. While Cubid will seed initial promotion, broader marketing efforts such as hackathons or bounty programs are expected to be led by the GoodDollar ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n# 6\\. Funding Request\n\nThis proposal is submitted to the **Gitcoin x GoodDollar Builders Program Quadratic Funding Round**, as part of the kickoff phase to grow the GoodDollar ecosystem through real-world utility, developer tooling, and ecosystem expansion.\n\nThe **GoodDollar-Cubid SDK** directly aligns with the round’s goals by enabling seamless, embeddable access to GoodDollar’s daily claim flow across both **web2 and web3 applications**. By combining wallet creation, face verification, and daily claiming into a single developer-friendly SDK, this project will:\n\n- **Enhance G$ utility** by making it accessible from anywhere online  \n- **Support real-world adoption** by onboarding users who don’t yet have wallets or technical knowledge  \n- **Empower builders** with an open-source integration layer that lowers the barrier to working with G$  \n- **Strengthen the GoodDollar ecosystem** through increased visibility, usage, and composability of the protocol\n\nWe’re seeking support from the community and matching partners to fund approximately **2–3 months of full-time development**, including:\n\n- SDK architecture and buildout  \n- UI component design and implementation  \n- Wallet integration and identity handling  \n- Documentation and developer onboarding  \n- Testing, iteration, and optional early adopter collaborations\n\nThe project will be developed by the **core Cubid team**, with a commitment to open-source licensing, transparency, and community engagement. We are not requesting a fixed amount, but are participating fully in the spirit of **quadratic funding**—leaning on the community’s belief in this tool’s potential to unlock greater impact for the entire G$ ecosystem.\n\nBy funding this SDK, you’re helping make GoodDollar as easy to integrate as Google Maps—and just as ubiquitous.\n\n---\n\n# 7\\. In Closing\n\nOur intention is to transparently document and share the value of this work, and make it available as an **open-sourced public good** for the benefit of the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe GoodDollar-Cubid SDK is a natural evolution of both platforms' missions: **accessible identity, permissionless finance,** and **inclusive tools that lower barriers to entry.** By making it easy to claim GoodDollars from anywhere, we unlock real utility, drive adoption, and bring the next wave of users into web3 — one line of code at a time.\n\nWe’re excited to build this and look forward to collaborating with the GoodDollar team and

plan to use the GoodDollar Identity SDK to ensure that voting on Sovereign Seas comes from unique users, effectively preventing Sybil attacks and duplicate voting that often plague decentralized governance systems. This integration will leverage zero-knowledge proofs to verify human uniqueness without compromising user privacy, significantly enhancing trust in our platform's voting results while maintaining a seamless user experience. The G$ Identity verification aligns perfectly with our mission of creating truly democratic funding mechanisms where communities can make collective decisions with confidence that each vote represents a genuine human perspective, ultimately ensuring resources flow to the most valued initiatives without manipulation or disproportionate influence from any single participant.","hidden":true,"question":"Project Description: Briefly describe your project and how it enhances G$ utility or adoption","questionId":0},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Technical Implementation with GoodDollar\n\nIntegration Approach\n\nOur implementation will integrate the GoodDollar Identity SDK as an optional security feature that campaign administrators can enable, particularly for high-stake voting campaigns:\n\nCampaign-Level Configuration: Campaign admins will have the ability to toggle G$ Identity verification requirements when creating or configuring campaigns. This feature will be especially valuable for campaigns with significant voting power or funding amounts.\n\nConfigurable Verification Thresholds: Admins can set different verification requirements based on vote multiplier levels - for example, requiring G$ Identity verification only for votes with 3x multiplier or higher, ensuring that high-impact votes come from verified unique humans.\n\nSmart Contract Integration: We'll extend our campaign creation contracts to include optional verification flags that, when enabled, require validated G$ Identity proofs for specific voting actions.\n\nEnhanced Voting Flow for Verified Campaigns:\n\nUser connects wallet to Sovereign Seas\n\nUser selects desired vote multiplier\n\nIf multiplier exceeds admin-defined threshold AND verification is enabled for the campaign, user is prompted to complete G$ Identity verification\n\nUpon successful verification, user receives a credential token\n\nWhen voting, this credential is cryptographically verified without exposing personal data\n\nSmart contract validates the credential before processing high-multiplier votes\n\nTechnical Components\n\nAdmin Configuration Panel: Add G$ Identity verification toggles and threshold settings to the campaign creation interface\n\nFrontend Integration: Incorporate the G$ Identity SDK conditionally based on campaign settings and vote multiplier selections\n\nSmart Contract Enhancements: Extend campaign creation parameters to include verification requirements flags\n\nConditional Verification Logic: Build logic that applies G$ Identity verification only when required by campaign settings\n\nZero-Knowledge Proof Handling: Implement cryptographic verification of G$ Identity proofs without storing sensitive user data\n\nImplementation Timeline\n\nPhase 1 (Weeks 1-2)\n\nSet up development environment with G$ Identity SDK\n\nExtend campaign creation interface with verification option toggles\n\nDesign conditional verification architecture\n\nPhase 2 (Weeks 3-4)\n\nFrontend integration of verification components and admin controls\n\nImplementation of conditional verification logic\n\nUpdate smart contracts to include verification flag parameters\n\nPhase 3 (Weeks 5-6)\n\nComplete smart contract modifications for conditional verification\n\nIntegration testing with G$ Identity system\n\nTesting of different campaign configurations and thresholds\n\nPhase 4 (Weeks 7-8)\n\nTestnet deployment with complete G$ Identity integration\n\nAdmin panel testing with various configuration scenarios\n\nFeedback collection from campaign creators\n\nPhase 5 (Weeks 9-10)\n\nSecurity review and performance optimization\n\nMainnet deployment of G$ Identity-enhanced voting system\n\nDocumentation for campaign admins on when to enable verification","hidden":true,"question":"Technical Implementation: Describe your approach and how it integrates with GoodDollar.

are developing a blockchain-based protocol that enables investors to purchase either $1,000 T-bonds or $10,000 property deed  investments to finance the construction of cyclone-proof homes in Madagascar.\n\nWhy This Matters\nTraditional mortgages are impractical for most people in Madagascar, leaving many without access to homeownership.\n\nOur rent-to-own model allows unbanked individuals to secure a home through deed-backed investments, providing a sustainable path to ownership.\n\nThis initiative fosters financial inclusion, affordable housing, and community development while ensuring investor participation in a meaningful impact-driven project.\n\nInitiative Overview\n\nThe Madagascar Housing Initiative aims to create affordable, sustainable housing while generating returns for investors and creating a positive social impact. By tokenizing $10,000 property deeds and integrating with Gooddollar's UBI platform, we're creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders.\n\nAffordable Housing\nCreating quality homes in Madagascar at $10,000 per unit with a rent-to-own model that empowers local residents.\n\nSocial Impact\n70% of funds are reinvested in Gooddollar, supporting universal basic income while generating sustainable returns.\n\nInvestor Returns\nStructured to provide competitive returns while creating lasting social impact through a transparent model.\n\nInvestment Structure\n\nProperty Deed Tokens\n\nOur primary investment vehicle will be the Madagascar Property Deed Token, priced at $10,000 per unit. Each token represents ownership in a single housing unit with the following allocation:\n\n30% allocated directly to the Construction Fund for building homes\n70% invested in Gooddollar (G$) through staking until needed for further development\nRent-to-own structure allows eventual ownership transfer to residents\nReturns generated from both rental income and G$ staking rewards\nT-Bond Integration (Separate Entity)\nUAE T-bonds are offered as a separate investment vehicle that complements the Property Deed Tokens:\n\nT-bonds can be staked to generate LST AED tokens\nLST AED can be invested in various projects, including our Madagascar initiative\nThis creates a separate liquidity pool that can support the housing ecosystem\nT-bond investors maintain full liquidity while still

-answer","answer":"We’re proposing to add GoodDollar’s Face Verification as a “stamp” inside Cubid, enabling a stronger trust signal within our identity framework while also expanding GoodDollar’s presence in the decentralized identity space. Cubid is a decentralized reputation protocol built to make human identity and trust legible across the internet — without compromising privacy or sovereignty. Within the Cubid Passport app users collect stamps—verifiable credentials tied to their wallet—that represent achievements, affiliations, or validations from trusted entities. Each stamp contributes to a user’s “humanity score”, a composite measure of reputation and trustworthiness online.","hidden":true,"question":"Project Description: Briefly describe your project and how it enhances G$ utility or adoption","questionId":0},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Already built functionalities\nStandard login with email\nCubid already supports WalletConnect and RainbowKit, and these methods will be used for connecting a GoodDollar-linked wallet.\nPersistent sessions. Cubid remembers which wallets a user has connected with. These two features combined mean that users don’t need to connect each time.\nStamps: Validating and storing user credentials using Oauth, NFTs, OpenID, etc.\nAssigning weights to each Stamp\nPrivacy-preserving, user-controlled credentials-sharing through open APIs.\n\nPhase 1: Add a Verified With GoodDollar Credential\nAs part of acquiring the Verified With GoodDollar stamp we will start by asking if the user already has a stamp. If they don’t then we guide them to the GoodDollar site and then come back to Cubid.\nIf they are verified, we’ll then ask the user to connect their external GoodDollar wallet.\nThen we will call the GoodDollar smart contract to check if a connected wallet has been face-verified.\nOnce validated, the Verified With GoodDollar stamp will be displayed on the user’s dashboard, and will be available for any third party dApp to request as part of the humanity score\n\nPhase 2: Embed the Face Verification Flow: \nIf the user responds that they are not yet verified with GoodDollar, then in this phase we will enable the face verification natively within Cubid, without having to leave the site.\nFirst we’ll ask the user to connect their external wallet. \nThen we’ll embed the newly released GoodDollar FaceVerification SDK directly into Cubid’s frontend.\nOnce verified, the Verified With GoodDollar stamp will be displayed on the user’s dashboard.","hidden":true,"question":"Technical Implementation: Describe your approach and how it integrates with GoodDollar.

Our strategy to drive adoption and G$ utility includes the following:\n\n1. Incentivized Identity Building\nWe’ll promote the GoodDollar stamp as a key credential within Cubid’s identity graph—used to:\n\nIncrease a user’s humanity score\n\nUnlock access to DAO governance, gated communities, and impact-based apps\n\nEnhance Sybil resistance for users participating in web3 platforms\n\nThe more stamps a user has, the more valuable their Cubid Passport becomes—creating a natural incentive to complete GoodDollar face verification and earn the stamp.\n\n2. Embedded in Onboarding Flows\nFor new users creating a Cubid Passport, the G$ verification stamp will be featured as a recommended action in the onboarding checklist. This drives consistent visibility and encourages organic adoption early in the user journey.\n\n3. Cross-Ecosystem Integration\nWe’re actively integrating Cubid with other dApps and communities that can leverage the G$ stamp as a credential—for example:\n\nGated access to DeFi or governance tools\n\nReputation scoring for task or bounty platforms\n\nSybil protection in community voting\n\nThis encourages users from other apps to verify via GoodDollar in order to participate more fully.\n\n4. Composability with Future Use Cases\nAs Cubid expands, the G$ verification stamp can be used in new ways—such as:\n\nProof of uniqueness for identity-based rewards\n\nEligibility criteria for microgrants and public goods programs\n\nWeighting in governance based on verified identity\n\n5. Social Proof & Visibility\nPublic profiles in Cubid display user stamps by default. The GoodDollar verification stamp will be visually distinct and featured as a signal of real, verified identity—encouraging social proof and driving peer adoption.","hidden":true,"question":"User Adoption Strategy: How will you attract users to your project and drive G$ adoption?

is a Savings protocol that allows everyday users to save in crypto without exposure to market volatility.**  Bitsave introduces ‘SaveFi’, a new on-chain savings model using user-owned smart contracts that help people—especially in underserved regions in African countries—build financial discipline with stable, goal-based savings.  **By integrating $G as a savings token on Bitsave**, we give G$ holders a secure, structured way to grow and manage their wealth. This integration expands $G utility from a basic UBI or spendable token into a **long-term savings vehicle**, encouraging users to treat G$ as a tool not only for daily expenses but for future planning.  **Key benefits for G$ adoption:**  - **New use case:** Introduces goal-based crypto saving for G$ holders. - **Wider exposure:** Bitsave users will be encouraged to save in G$, increasing awareness and adoption. - **Financial empowerment:** Especially for users in emerging markets, saving in G$ helps them escape inflation and build stability.  With this integration, G$ becomes more than a basic income token—it becomes a **savings safety net**.","hidden":true,"question":"Project Description: Briefly describe your project and how it enhances G$ utility or adoption","questionId":0},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"**Technical Implementation:**\n\nBitsave is built on EVM-compatible chains using Solidity smart contracts.

Token Integration:**\n\n- Add $G token support to our contract interface as a valid deposit asset\n- Enable $G selection as a preferred stable token when creating savings plans\n\n**2. Savings Plan Logic Extension:**\n\n- Modify contract logic to support interest-free tokens like $G\n- Implement seamless $G balance handling for recurring deposits, withdrawals, and penalties\n\n**3. $G Smart Contract Interaction:**\n\n- Ensure compliance with $G staking and withdrawal standards\n- Explore integration with GoodStaking or GoodReserve contracts for additional features, pending $G team guidance.\n\n**4. UI/UX Update:**\n\n- Add $G balance display, plan creation, and savings goal tracking\n- Integrate with wallets (like Fuse + GoodDollar) for seamless onboarding of existing $G users\n\n**5. Testing and Audit:**\n\n- Deploy and test $G support with the community.\n- Submit implementation for $G community review and third-party audit\n1.

We’ll run grassroots campaigns to educate users about both platforms—expanding the G$ footprint together.","hidden":true,"question":"Ecosystem Contribution: How does your project complement existing initiatives in the GoodDollar ecosystem rather than competing with them?","questionId":6},{"type":"dropdown","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Ethical Compliance: Confirm you have read and will comply with the ethical standards outlined in the eligibility criteria.","questionId":7},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"I'd like you to take a look at our user journey, We've built up to this level with personal funds and team effort, this grant will help us scale massively, and I'm excited for this, please take out a moment to read our story and do watch the onboarding of Alex, and listen for some of her remarks, because that's exactly the reaction new users would give, thank you. https://x.com/_karlagod/status/1908155985459401153","hidden":true,"question":"Additional Info: Is there anything else critical for evaluating your project that wasn't covered in the questions above?","questionId":8}],"project":{"id":"0x0d4cee5aba84526fa9bfab5c08a9ded987f2c948a46da395230c6c811b44eee6","title":"Bitsave Protocol","logoImg":"bafkreifc3ljhtbjgqlteoowbuqaffjtx7kg2xzvv6fv7g4wmvzpeq5m6oy","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreif5hegcs73c56edgnyrijenzulah36cwwm5vta2bdl4vev5phvxbe","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://bitsave.cryptosmartnow.io/","bannerImg":"bafkreia2bxmmrm6awrr3anwrikm4g64ctkrcupusbdk4k34qiv5lsg7bka","createdAt":1713454673809,"userGithub":"BitsaveNigeria","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..AE_kkujo2HDDljqUcCDwlPbiyepzw9FNrvOztfUfa3zfFBPTGIJqdnhj0geqy4adbdp5IH0DfKtOJzT-CsitAg","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-18T15:17:13.867Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-18T15:17:13.867Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-17T15:17:13.867Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x72578e136E72A18A832be6762230a820f514d180","hash":"v0.0.0:dkjUOIkl6HXfTnc9Ov8UlOtz++SNUpINuNaR84LOLBs=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#CryptoSmartNow#107388068"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..x_Si8QZrlThfGetg1kEqQI2kCkWX_ItOSZO23B7ziEM9pX5CdnilhbdnB95s5GvDoCk4yU9LU3Pwl08EB3Y5Dw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-18T15:07:00.389Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-18T15:07:00.389Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-17T15:07:00.389Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x72578e136E72A18A832be6762230a820f514d180","hash":"v0.0.0:+g1I9noEbzCg57oGkzPWnjQ5xyvrrfO0M6LiQp2Dkcs=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#cryptosmartnow"}}},"description":"# WHAT IS BITSAVE?\n\nBitsave is a savings protocol that helps users save in Cryptocurrency without losing their savings to Market volatility.\n\n# BITSAVE SOLUTION (simplified)\n\n- Bitsave helps everyday people in African Countries escape inflation in their fiat currencies by saving in dollars.\n- The dollar is not easily accessible to the average African through traditional banks, you have to go through many KYCed processes and get \n- Bitsave helps users create an automatic recurring savings plan with Stables.\n\n**How Bitsave Works**  \n[![save.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RFNQkQHG/save.png)](https://postimg.cc/gXbZRh46)\n\n**1.

Break Savings Penalties**\nUsers set the penalty fee (1%–5% of their savings) when creating the plan. Users with bad savings habit who want to discipline them selves to save and discourage themselves from breaking their savings usually set the highest fee.
