Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative focused on establishing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) within DeSci (Decentralized Science) to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR), with the ultimate goal of expanding globally.\n\nThree Verticals:\nMarine Biotech fuels discoveries within the DeSciHub, accelerating open innovation.\n\nSocio-ecological efforts ensure that biotech tools are ethically deployed and community-owned.\n\nDeSciHub provides the infrastructure to scale both biotech and social impact globally.\n\nLong-term Goal:\nA self-sustaining ecosystem where science funds conservation, conservation empowers communities, and communities drive science.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras (Fig 1). It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n![image](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)\nFig 1. A map of the Mesoamerican Reef, © WWF Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\nMesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).\n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252F5iB319gFA87fE0i4ImEU%252FMesoReefDAO%2520Framework%2520Conservation.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db2a6e496-8306-4f57-8681-2838fa04713c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c5acf856&sv=1)\nFig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerating coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4.

Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative focused on establishing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) within DeSci (Decentralized Science) to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR), with the ultimate goal of expanding globally.\n\nThree Verticals:\nMarine Biotech fuels discoveries within the DeSciHub, accelerating open innovation.\n\nSocio-ecological efforts ensure that biotech tools are ethically deployed and community-owned.\n\nDeSciHub provides the infrastructure to scale both biotech and social impact globally.\n\nLong-term Goal:\nA self-sustaining ecosystem where science funds conservation, conservation empowers communities, and communities drive science.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras (Fig 1). It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n![image](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)\nFig 1. A map of the Mesoamerican Reef, © WWF Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\nMesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).\n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252F5iB319gFA87fE0i4ImEU%252FMesoReefDAO%2520Framework%2520Conservation.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db2a6e496-8306-4f57-8681-2838fa04713c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c5acf856&sv=1)\nFig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerating coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n\n**When?**\n\n\n*2024-2030*\n\n\n- Develop a Web2+Web3 Interface\n- Expansion and Onboarding Efforts\n- Exploration of Web3 DAO Tools\n- Collaboration Partnerships and Initiatives\n- Research and Development Initiatives (i.e., Tokenomics, Biodiversity Credits)\n- Community Engagement and Transparency\n- Continuous Improvement and Adaptation\n- Pilot Programs and Proof of Concept: RegenReef (Fig. 4-5):\n\n\n   1. - Biobank of corals\n   2. - Coral and Fish Nursery\n   3. - Micropropagation Zone\n   4. - Disease and Bleaching Research Unit\n   5. - DeSci Web3 Collaboration Hub\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJoksYFXgAAqMf-?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nFig 4.

**A Local Node as a Rooted Cooperative  🌱**\n\n[**ReFi Barcelona**](https://refibcn.cat/Home_CAT) is a local node within the global [**ReFi movement**](https://refibcn.cat/Ecosystem+Map/Global+-+ReFi+and+Web3/ReFi+Ecosystem), focused on connecting **regenerative finance, local regenerators and the Social & Solidarity Economy (ESS)** in Barcelona and across Catalonia - to drive forward the so called **[ecosocial transition](https://www.bcn.coop/transicio-ecosocial/).**\n\nWe’re also part of a broader bioregional effort through [**ReFi Mediterranean**](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/refi-mediterranean-gg23), where we collaborate with other nodes across the bioregion to scale regenerative strategies and funding mechanisms for regenerative work.\n\n> We serve as a bridge between global Web3 infrastructure and place-based economic transformation.\n> \n\n### Our Approach: Building Hybrid Systems Through Cooperative Structures **🌍**\n\nReFi Barcelona is a **proof of concept** for building regenerative systems that are both **technologically innovative and socially grounded**.\n\nWe believe that to regenerate economies, we need **hybrid infrastructures** that:\n\n- **Leverage Web3** for transparency, coordination, and composability; as well as for opening opportunities for funding and support\n- **Integrate cooperative models** for human-scale governance and economic justice\n- **Learn from local territories**, while staying globally connected\n\n### Our plan: Growing from the roots of cooperativism 🌲\n\nTo build systems that work beyond theory, we need **real-world grounding**.\n\nThat’s why ReFi BCN is based at [**Bloc4**](https://bloc4.coop/), Europe’s largest cooperative innovation hub — home to more than 40 cooperatives and social enterprises. Bloc4 provides:\n\n- Access to **funding channels beyond Web3** (public & cooperative finance)\n- **Mentorship and training** in governance, sustainability and viability\n- Daily exposure to the **needs, tools and culture** of ESS actors\n- Incubation from Bloc4/Coòpolis, Barcelona's cooperative development agency\n\n> Bloc4 amplifies our ability to design, test and share\n> \n> \n> **hybrid regenerative models with the local Social & Solidarity Economy.**\n> \n\n![image.png](https://file.notion.so/f/f/98673c04-e3cf-4b0a-8f3c-a85c8332f21e/a19384a8-35f8-46d0-b142-acbaeef51911/New_Draft_Image.png?table=block&id=1c86ed08-45cb-808a-bc32-f89393d277a5&spaceId=98673c04-e3cf-4b0a-8f3c-a85c8332f21e&expirationTimestamp=1743544800000&signature=3nlR-dOXuJ-lUAfTvc87ut6k2XjT8IyR4D7sav-VfKs&downloadName=New+Draft+Image.png)\n\n![photo_2025-03-27 13.53.32.jpeg](https://file.notion.so/f/f/98673c04-e3cf-4b0a-8f3c-a85c8332f21e/09458670-9d1e-4f73-b6a3-abee709f28f9/New_Draft_Photo_Mar_27_2025.jpeg?table=block&id=1c86ed08-45cb-801a-929b-d114ed900336&spaceId=98673c04-e3cf-4b0a-8f3c-a85c8332f21e&expirationTimestamp=1743544800000&signature=c8mjrCuzjd5vdJnB21kJYmRDfgWWdpUVOpQ1R7-c2Mg&downloadName=New+Draft+Photo+Mar+27+2025.jpeg)\n\n## The strategic lines we are building 🎍\n\nWe’ve identified the following key strategic lines of work to support the work of local regenerators.

The loss of tree cover, rainfall variability, increased temperature and events like wind erosion has had severe environmental consequences. In addition to tremendous loss of biodiversity, the region experiences soil degradation, erosion, desertification and landslides.\nAccording to the United Nations, Nigeria has the highest rate of deforestation in the world, losing 3.7 percent of its forest every year. It is also home to Africa’s largest mangrove forest, but only six percent is protected. Its multiple ecological zones have given rise to a wide range of livelihoods, agricultural practices, and commodities, all of which are affected by climate change and shocks.\nSolution\nOur Green Project initiative is helping to address the interconnected challenges through a comprehensive approach that combines reforestation, climate and environmental education, regenerative agriculture and biodiversity conservation, leading to a more sustainable future for our environment and communities. The project focuses on restoring degraded landscapes by planting native and endangered species, and implementing agroforestry systems that promote biodiversity and improve soil health. We are working closely with local communities, schools, and government institutions to raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable practices. Green Planet Conservation Initiative is also committed to ensuring the transparency, accuracy, and effectiveness of our tree planting activities. To achieve this, we are employed a digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) Silvi protocol. These digital tools will enhance our ability to monitor tree growth, track progress, and provide verifiable data to our stakeholders.

With a proven track record of training 1,213 farmers, planting 45,000+ fruit trees, and restoring 10 wetlands, we seek funding to scale our impact through a larger training center and expanded restoration efforts. The project addresses critical environmental challenges while building climate resilience for low-income communities\n\nOur environmental restoration work benefits everyone in the region regardless of their participation. Restored wetlands and forests provide ecosystem services (water filtration, flood control, carbon sequestration) that are freely available to all community members.\nOur climate change education and awareness campaigns are openly accessible to all community members, with no restrictions on who can benefit from the knowledge.\nThe fruit trees we plant in schools and health centers provide benefits (shade, fruit, improved air quality) to anyone who visits these public spaces.\n\nThe environmental benefits from restored wetlands and forests don't diminish when more people benefit from them. Clean air, water filtration, and carbon sequestration serve everyone simultaneously without reduction in quality.\nThe knowledge we share through our training programs can be used by any number of farmers without reducing its value to others.\nThe climate resilience infrastructure we build benefits the entire community without diminishing its value for any individual\n\nWHY\nUganda loses approximately 200,000 hectares of forest annually, creating an urgent need to scale up our restoration efforts.\nOur current training space is too small to meet growing community demand for regenerative agriculture training.\nClimate change impacts are intensifying in Eastern Uganda, requiring immediate action to build community resilience.\nThe project has proven successful with 1,213 farmers trained and 45,000+ trees planted, demonstrating readiness to scale.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPlant 1 million native trees by 2027\nRehabilitate 100 hectares of wetlands\nIncrease forest cover and enhance biodiversity\nImprove natural water filtration systems\n\nCommunity Impact:\nTrain 5,000+ additional rural farmers in regenerative agriculture\nExpand skills training for women and girls (tailoring, hairdressing)\nPlant fruit trees in 200 new schools, health centers & churches\nReach 80% of local population with environmental conservation awareness\n\nClimate Resilience:\nEnhanced community adaptation to climate change\nImproved agricultural productivity through sustainable methods\nIncreased food security through diversified farming practices\n\nQuarterly Progress Reports:\nNumber of trees planted and survival rates\nHectares of wetlands restored\nNumber of farmers trained\nSkills training participation rates\n\nImpact Measurement:\nEcological assessments of restored areas\nCommunity surveys on awareness and adoption of sustainable practices\nDocumentation of improved agricultural yields\nPhoto and video documentation of restoration progress\nCommunity Engagement:\nRegular community feedback sessions\nParticipatory monitoring of restoration sites\nSuccess story documentation\nSocial media updates and progress sharing\n\nObjective 1\n\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\n\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\n\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\n\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\n\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n\nObjective 2\n\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\n\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n\nObjective 3\n\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\n\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n\nObjective 4\n\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\n\nYour support will enable AYOWECCA UGANDA to scale our proven model of environmental restoration and community development, creating lasting public goods that benefit both current and future generations in Eastern Uganda.","hidden":false,"question":"What are your key active goals, plans, objectives or milestones for this

By implementing a comprehensive framework for\n\nevaluation and planning for future funding through eco-tourism initiatives and international partnerships, we are dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our conservation efforts in Tororo Eastern Uganda and economic empowerment for women and rural farmers.\n\n![communitytreeplantingevent](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8.png)\n\n\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"AYOWECCA-UGANDA","projectTwitter":"ayowecca_uganda"},"metadataCid":"bafkreickg5cdzlb7w5gggptvy65yl45yfp4uzjcpl46fr364i3xddrecae","timestamp":"2025-03-20T15:52:59+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xE024C19924e867B46049c709Ad1239Fb3cDcE255","createdAtBlock":30962279}],"projectId":"0xbaae2a3e1fc6459d4fa44ff7df23883bdd0066f8841507be5cce9839662528f5","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"31","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-21T11:31:53.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"30976412"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-07T18:17:51.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"32149113"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32213268,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-21T11:31:53+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x8DbB01ceF45f99F8A13c695Abac9F7B8DD945544","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":30984958,"createdByAddress":"0x4B2bE391Da027155b21b725c37fF289A46d9C06c","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"3","metadata":{"signature":"0x54ee8131346b862f1b194e95e4ae2f90afc3736de86e84d333f08ad6ddea557f6de464557514aace5f70dc15ce98dfd7141e1e5e112bea9ddc920e53705334261c","application":{"round":"0x487fb600a0627b1ee95bf280c5c8bd415e0be58a","answers":[{"type":"email","answer":"e-co.lab@outlook.com","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0},{"type":"number","answer":"4","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":1},{"type":"checkbox","answer":["Not formally"],"hidden":false,"question":"Is your project a member or past grantee of one of these networks?","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"E-co.lab is a project whose general objective is to research, develop and validate, in an innovative and technologically advanced way, the certifications of best practices for businesses, whether these are quality, occupational health and safety, environmental and sustainability, traditional knowledge, guarantee of origin, traceability, regulatory compliance, among others.\n\nThe cutting-edge technology planned for the development of solutions for customers and partners is Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology offers exceptional benefits for certification solutions, such as:\n\ntransparency, since all records are visible to authorized parties, which increases trust;\n\nsecurity, since data is encrypted and virtually immutable, which reduces the risk of fraud;\n\ndecentralization, since there is no need for a central authority, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency;\n\nand traceability, which facilitates the monitoring of the complete history of a certification.\n\nBy harnessing the potential of Blockchain technologies as a whole, we intend to create a certification ecosystem combined with decentralized (DeFi) and regenerative (ReFi) finance, which not only endorses the practices of our clients and partners, but also contributes to practices of democratizing learning through digital means, digital inclusion in cutting-edge technologies, financial inclusion and sustainable development.\n\nIn addition to Blockchain technology, E.co-lab will be based on Participatory Guarantee Systems (SPG), characterized by Social Control and Joint Responsibility, which enables the generation of credibility appropriate to different social, cultural, political, institutional, organizational and economic realities. Social Control is a process of generating credibility, necessarily recognized by society, organized by a group of clients and partners who work with commitment and seriousness. It is established by the direct participation of its members in collective actions to assess the compliance of the practices to be certified with the technical regulations. Joint Responsibility occurs when all group members commit to complying with the technical requirements of the practices to be certified and are jointly responsible in cases of non-compliance by some of its members.\n\nE-co.lab also aims to promote and strengthen R&D&I for sustainable products and services, with the inclusion and initial motivation of customers and partners in the consumer markets that its products and services are prepared to reach. Some of the customers and partners, mostly not included in the solutions currently available, include recyclers, seed collectors, ecotourism guides, agroecological farmers, permaculturists, herbalists, traditional midwives, therapists of integrative and complementary health practices (PICS), animal rights activists, among others.\n\n1.a.

It is located in Brazil, Goiás State, on Chapada dos Veadeiros, in the microregion of Goiás northeastern, approximately 270 km from Brasília, the federal capital, and 470 km from Goiânia, the state capital. It is part of the Natural World Heritage of Cerrado Protected Areas, part of the Pouso Alto Environmental Protection Area (APA de Pouso Alto) and is bordering the Kalunga Historical Site and Cultural Heritage (SHPCK).\n\nManagement and productive activities at E-co.lab are guided by permaculture, in the adoption of agroecology, bioconstruction, ecological tourism, recycle, and more, with the use of natural, organic and biodynamic bases, techniques and practices consistent with ecosystem respect on nature-based solutions (SBN). The projects are organized in e-co.lab's cores, which are:\n\nE-co.lab Agroecology - In agroecology, the diagnosis returned, briefly, to the presence of two distinct zones: naturally preserved areas and degraded areas for recovery. It was decided, in the initial stages, for agroextractivism in naturally preserved areas that are not fully protected, for the collection of non-timber forest products in naturally preserved areas and that are for full protection, and for production in Agroforestry Systems in the areas to be recovered. An Agroecological Network with all interested parties will also be promoted.\n\nE-co.lab Bioconstruction - When it comes to bioconstruction, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. E-co.lab Bioconstruction proves to be a priority, since the other e-co.lab's need shared infrastructure to be bioconstructed.\n\nE-co.lab Decentralized Science (Desci) - The community generates a lot of knowledge. In general, this knowledge is lost due to misdocumentation, and low recognition due to the lack of adoption of the appropriate scientific method. In this action we adopted a popular language to guide popular agents to document their practices and adopt the scientific method, generating Desci assets.\n\nE-co.lab Ecological Tourism - In ecological tourism, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. Unique and differentiated potentials in bathing and adventure tourism have already been identified, in addition to a potential link to the National Long-Distance Trails Network, in the Canoeiros Trail, north of the Goyazes Pathway.\n\nE-co.lab Recycle - When it comes to recycling, E-co.lab acts and provides support to institutions, collectives and individuals working in the collection, sorting, processing and disposal of waste. Improving adopted practices and complementing them with SBN and other innovative solutions is the main focus of this action.\n\nE-co.lab Regenerative Finance (ReFi) - Community agents involved in environmental regeneration actions, in general, lack digital inclusion and financial inclusion. ReFi supports the digital and financial inclusion of these agents, also providing possible income generation.

The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\nBackground\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations.

The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\n# Background\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations. As one of the pioneers in Public Goods, GreenPill would like to share its experience and develop local chapters for different cities over the world.\n\nWhen two communities connected with each other, the idea of Taiwan Chapter was born.\n\nMission & Vision, Value alignment\n\nGreen Sofa aligns with the mission and vision of GreenPill, which is to build a global network society transcending national and cultural boundaries, while exporting regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.\n\nAs one team under FAB DAO, Green Sofa aims to explore the possiblity of collaboration wtih Greenpill international and FAB DAO. It is a school for FAB DAO learning from GreenPill about Public Goods, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack. It is also a laboratory for FAB DAO to apply the knowledge, kick off hands-on projects in smaller scale, to gain local experiences and feedback to FAB DAO and GreenPill.\n\nCritical success factors\n\nIncrease awareness of the Greenpill and look for collaboration opportunity with FAB DAO\n\nLearn and apply Greenpill related tools and knowledge to support FAB DAO development, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack, Hypercert.\n\nAct as the communication channel between FAB DAO and Greenpill International and other local chapters.\n\n# Hypercert project: Tamagochi at Riverside\n\nProject Website: https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region\n\n[Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n![Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192&w=640&q=75)\n\n# 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling  \nIn rapidly urbanized cities like Taipei, rivers are often overlooked, over-dredged, and stripped of biodiversity. The Huangxi River (Southern Sulfur Creek), once teeming with life, has seen its ecosystem disrupted by aggressive vegetation clearing and human detachment. Shy native species like the White-breasted Waterhen have nearly vanished from view. If we don't act now, we risk losing not only vital habitats but also the community's connection to the very nature flowing beside them.\n\n---\n\n# 📜 Our Solution  \n**Tamagochi at Riverside** brings together environmental education, civic action, and Web3 technology to rewild our imaginations—and our rivers. Partnering with Huangxi Environmental Education Programme (HEEP) and Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO), we designed a playful, powerful campaign where students and citizens alike complete ecological missions, earn interactive NFTs, and re-learn how to live with rivers as neighbors. Through school programs, community workshops, and NFT collectibles, we’re rebuilding bonds between people and place—and helping wildlife thrive again.\n\n---\n\n# 🌱 Our Organisation / Community  \nWe are a collaboration between **HEEP**, a grassroots environmental education initiative, and **FAB DAO**, a Web3 collective focused on public good. Together, we’ve built a vibrant, decentralized community of educators, parents, artists, technologists, and river-lovers. We’ve reached **50,000+ local residents**, **20+ community partners**, and over **3,000 students and parents** from Mingde Elementary School alone.\n\n[GreenSofa_TW](https://hackmd.io/@greensofa/home) |  [FAB FAO](https://fabdao.world/) |  [HEEP](https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region)\n\n---\n\n# 🖼️ See Our Impact  \n- [Tamagochi at Riverside NFT](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14470)  \n- [Heart of the River Corridor POAP](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14471)\n\n---\n\n# 🔗 [View Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n---\n\n# 📝 What This Hypercert Represents  \nBetween **March and December 2023**, we ran school-wide ecological challenges, issued **300+ proof-of-attendance NFTs (POAPs)**, hosted over **10 public events**, and piloted habitat recovery in **2 riverbank zones**. We replaced top-down conservation messaging with community-led learning. Students adopted digital Waterhen “pets,” learned through play, and became stewards of real-world habitats—helping restore native biodiversity and reshape urban watershed governance.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ Proof That It’s Working  \nNative species like the **White-breasted Waterhen** have dewelled to rehabilitated zones. Over **300 NFTs** were minted to mark engagement. Student feedback and observational data confirm increased ecological awareness and behavioral change.  \n\n📂 [See the Proof of Impact](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXgtcFSb46AR2ktN9Dq2R3CYoUXnr_Td?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n# 💡 Join Us in Making a Difference!  \nYour support helps us scale this playful, powerful model to other schools, rivers, and cities.

With one of the highest inequality rates globally (Gini coefficient: 0.67) and a youth unemployment rate of 44.3% ([Stats SA, 2023](https://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0211/P02113rdQuarter2023.pdf); [World Bank, 2023](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/publication/south-africa-economic-update)), many young people face limited access to basic services such as water, energy, housing, and education. \nWe create opportunities for youth to lead systems change through innovation, digital infrastructure, and community action.\n\n[![Hackethon one](https://i.imgur.com/SqRiVjh.jpeg \"Optional hover text\")](https://i.imgur.com/SqRiVjh.jpeg)\n\n\n## 🎯 Mission Statement ##\nReFi Cape Town is a community-driven initiative for regenerative urban development through Web3, human-centered design, and biomimicry.\nOur mission is to equip young South Africans, NGOs, and grassroots social enterprises with tools and networks to tackle systemic challenges like inequality, unemployment, and limited service access.\nWe are building digital infrastructure that enables youth-led initiatives to coordinate, measure, verify, finance, and govern impactful solutions for people and the planet.\n\n\n## 🧭 Our Core Objectives ##\n\n[![Hackethon one](https://i.imgur.com/sZmQ77l.jpeg \"Optional hover text\")](https://i.imgur.com/sZmQ77l.jpeg)\n\n\n**1. Activate Local Participation**\nWe host monthly ReFi events and bi-annual hackathons to grow networks and co-design regenerative solutions. These gatherings feature expert speakers and hands-on collaboration across sectors.\n**2. Incubate Youth Innovation**\nWe support early-stage, youth-led social enterprises working on context-specific challenges that leverage Web3 tools. Our incubation program offers mentorship and practical support to move ideas from concept to implementation.\n**3. Develop AI Oracles for Youth Impact Verification**\nWe want to build out use-case driven AI Oracles that can evaluate and verify youth-led impact activities. These oracles enable advanced digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV) and can trigger on-chain actions such as token transactions, issuance of impact certificates, and smart contract execution. By offering these services to mission-aligned organizations, we support scalable, automated, and transparent impact evaluation across youth-focused programs. This can generate revenue for supporting the mandate of the ReFi Cape Town DAO. \n**4. Foster Knowledge Exchange**\nThrough technical workshops, university outreach, and community partnerships, we bridge ecosystems—linking young people, NGOs, Web3 developers, and regenerative finance leaders to co-create resilient futures.\n**🔐 Building Transparent Governance**\nWe are developing constitutional documents to formalize our governance structures, laying the foundation for decentralized decision-making. Our goal is to empower community-led groups to propose and vote on how the ReFi Cape Town treasury is used—ensuring transparent, inclusive, and accountable stewardship of resource\n\n[![Hackethon one](https://i.imgur.com/X8AzSut.jpeg \"Optional hover text\")](https://i.imgur.com/X8AzSut.jpeg)\n\n\n## 👥 Team ##\nReFi Cape Town is led by a diverse and multidisciplinary team rooted in both local action and global innovation:\n[Shawn Alimohammadi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-alimohammadi-4b34b3139/)\n**Systems Builder & Regeneration Strategist**\nYouth & Green Economy Lead at IXO World and social entrepreneur.

To that end, we are working towards integrating impact data directly on the project profile and category profile pages. We have already integrated data for 20 projects.\n\n## 2) ReFi Impact Dashboard\n\nWe have launched the beta version and are now working on launching an updated version with more data connected and better interactivity.\n\n## 3) Community database management\n\nWe want the ReFi project database to remain a public good. As such, we are aiming for a community approach where decisions regarding the database are not made by us. This would involve allowing projects to claim their profile page by purchasing an NFT for a modest sum. Our end goal is to make this an open-source \"ecosystem management\" tool available to anyone.\n\n## 4) 2025 editions of the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN reports\n\nWe aim to use this year's reports plus the data we are aggregating to produce richer, more insightful reports in 2025.\n\n## 5) ReFi \"hotspot\" content\n\nWe are looking to expand the geographic scope of our content to include ReFi hotspots Latin America, West Africa, East Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.\n\n## 6) Educational content partnership with GreenPill Writers Guild\n\nA series of research-based articles to explore a key question: how much are ReFi communities using Web3 tools, and how are those tools affecting their work? Through interviews, surveys, and case studies, we’ll look at how people coordinate, which tools they use, and what gets in the way. Our shared goal is to support the Local ReFi Toolkit by identifying patterns, surfacing common challenges, and connecting them to the Toolkit’s practical recommendations. \n\n# Links\n\n**ReFi Project DB** -

Developed by Silvi, Treekipedia provides a unified, structured, and AI-enhanced repository of species data, reforestation methodologies, and ecological insights. By integrating consolidated biodiversity data, AI research agents, and community-driven contributions, Treekipedia ensures reliable, transparent, and accessible tree knowledge for tree stewards, researchers, and citizen scientists worldwide.\n\n## The Problem: Fragmented and Static Tree Knowledge\n\nScientific and ecological data on trees are scattered across institutional archives, peer-reviewed studies, and community-driven sources, with over 70% of this data existing in unstructured, non-machine-readable formats. Local stewards and reforestation practitioners hold valuable field knowledge, yet this insight is often missing from centralized databases. These inefficiencies slow down reforestation efforts, ecological modeling, and sustainable land management.\n\nAdditionally, as climate change reshapes ecosystems, tree habitat suitability and stewardship practices must evolve. There is an urgent need for a living, shared database that can adapt to real-world ecological changes. Treekipedia addresses this by structuring and decentralizing tree intelligence into an open-access, evolving knowledge system.\n\n## Treekipedia's Approach: A Unified Database\n\nTreekipedia is designed as an interoperable knowledge hub, enabling institutions, researchers, and tree stewards to contribute, query, and verify tree-related information. It ensures transparency and accuracy by integrating AI-driven analytics, blockchain-verified data provenance, and decentralized validation models.\n\nAt its core, Treekipedia consolidates species data, ecological insights, and reforestation methodologies into a structured, AI-enhanced repository. AI research agents autonomously extract, synthesize, and organize tree data from sources such as academic papers, government records, and community-contributed observations. These agents not only standardize taxonomic and ecological classifications but also continuously expand the dataset with new research findings.\n\nTo maintain credibility and transparency, Treekipedia integrates **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** to validate AI-generated research. When a user initiates a research request, the AI agent compiles relevant data, pins the research output to IPFS, and generates a cryptographic attestation via EAS. This process ensures that all contributions remain verifiable, tamper-resistant, and permanently recorded.\n\nBeyond AI and blockchain verification, Treekipedia is community-driven. Tree stewards, researchers, and citizen scientists can contribute firsthand insights, validate data, and refine reforestation methodologies. Contributions follow standardized tree knowledge schemas, ensuring interoperability across biodiversity databases, conservation platforms, and ecological research institutions.\n\nTreekipedia also introduces blockchain-backed incentives to fund research and encourage participation. Through **Contreebution NFTs**, users can sponsor AI-driven research for specific species at a low cost (~$3 per species). These NFTs, minted across multiple chains (**Celo, Base, Optimism, & Arbitrum**), provide on-chain records of contributions while supporting ongoing database expansion. In the future, governance will be further decentralized through **DeepTrees NFT** collections, where *Iconic Species NFTs* may play a role in guiding Treekipedia's evolution and funding ecosystem initiatives.\n\nBy combining AI, decentralized validation, and open collaboration, Treekipedia is not just a static database—it is an expanding intelligence network for tree knowledge. Whether used by scientists modeling forest dynamics, land stewards planning reforestation projects, or conservationists tracking biodiversity, Treekipedia will serve as a core infrastructure layer for global reforestation intelligence.\n\n## Silvi and Treekipedia\n\nTreekipedia is developed and supported by **Silvi**, a blockchain-powered reforestation protocol. Silvi has already integrated Treekipedia as its species data source within the Silvi App, making it the authoritative knowledge base for tree intelligence in Silvi's ecosystem.\n\nTreekipedia's foundation was built through extensive data collection, cleaning, and structuring. Over the past year, the team has aggregated **25 million+ raw species records** from 10+ global biodiversity datasets, including GBIF, iNaturalist, SiBBr, and SpeciesLink. After deduplication, taxonomy validation, and synonym resolution, the dataset now includes **50,000+ unique tree species** with **17.6 million observational records**.\n\nTreekipedia's ontology is structured around 50+ taxonomic, ecological, and functional attributes, providing a standardized framework for knowledge retrieval. A custom TaxonID system ensures unique species identification and data consistency across datasets.\n\nFor decentralized access and long-term integrity, Treekipedia integrates Blazegraph for structured querying and IPFS for decentralized storage, where AI-generated research reports are permanently pinned. Additionally, species distributions are being mapped across ecoregions and biomes using OneEarth's bioregional framework, expanding interoperability with conservation and reforestation initiatives.\n\nThis foundation sets the stage for Treekipedia's next evolution—an AI-enhanced, decentralized ecosystem for tree intelligence.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nTreekipedia is being developed through a structured roadmap, progressively expanding its capabilities, refining infrastructure, and increasing community participation.\n\n### Phase 1: Treekipedia v1.0 Launch\n\n- **Tree Species Search**: A searchable database of 50,080+ species with structured taxonomy, habitat, and ecological data.\n- **Species Knowledge Pages**: Wikipedia-style entries with real-time updates as new research is conducted.\n- **AI Research Agent**: AI-driven research retrieval and structuring, filling knowledge gaps.\n- **Contreebution NFTs**: A low-cost (~$3) mechanism for users to sponsor AI-driven research.\n- **EAS & IPFS Integration**: Research data is pinned to IPFS and cryptographically attested for transparency.\n- **Treederboard**: A leaderboard showcasing contributors, incentivizing engagement.\n- **Graph Database Querying**: Structured Blazegraph-powered queries for advanced ecological insights.\n\n### Phase 2: Infrastructure Refinement & Expansion\n\n- Blazegraph API Deployment for scalable, high-performance querying.\n- Ontology & Data Versioning for structured taxonomy updates.\n- AI-Powered Data Validation to ensure research accuracy before integration.\n\n### Phase 3: Community Engagement & Governance\n\n- **Working Group Formation**: Collaboration with scientists, reforestation organizations, and conservationists.\n- **Decentralized Governance**: Expansion of EAS attestations, peer review incentives, and contribution weighting.\n- **DeepTrees NFT Collection**: Launch of the \"Iconic Species\" NFT series, integrated into governance.\n\n### Phase 4: AI & Ecological Intelligence Scaling\n\n- Advanced AI Research Agents for complex ecological modeling.\n- Automated Knowledge Updates for self-improving AI accuracy.\n- Decentralized Validation through a multi-tier credibility scoring system.\n\n### Phase 5: Full Public Rollout & Global Collaboration\n\n- Treekipedia API Launch for integration with external research platforms.\n- Silvi Integration to support MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) applications.\n- Global Partnerships with biodiversity institutions and ecological monitoring networks.","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"SilviProtocol","projectTwitter":"SilviProtocol"},"recipient":"0x4a24d4a7c36257E0bF256EA2970708817C597A2C"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreib2vchkxmbvubyhzqd7qrtgp4jhdcs7jwrxzqjcyov6cfmd73oixa","projects":[{"name":"Treekipedia","id":"0xd4e805402ef75b899d0ad42d8325287074da817180850fcbc177b41764637a15","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Treekipedia","logoImg":"bafkreiertowwns2bgslnsojsh3d76au3fvg263xoeaej7iibks5xomxeeu","website":"https://treekipedia.silvi.earth","bannerImg":"bafkreig7xnjlx4k6g2es6zhjbi3d57x5akoogscbrjfrn4cb3tyu4dsbx4","createdAt":1743450808520,"userGithub":"sevnightingale","credentials":{},"description":"# Treekipedia: Tree Intelligence Commons\n\n## Overview\n\nTreekipedia is an open-source, comprehensive database of tree knowledge.

Through **Contreebution NFTs**, users can sponsor AI-driven research for specific species at a low cost (~$3 per species). These NFTs, minted across multiple chains (**Celo, Base, Optimism, & Arbitrum**), provide on-chain records of contributions while supporting ongoing database expansion. In the future, governance will be further decentralized through **DeepTrees NFT** collections, where *Iconic Species NFTs* may play a role in guiding Treekipedia's evolution and funding ecosystem initiatives.\n\nBy combining AI, decentralized validation, and open collaboration, Treekipedia is not just a static database—it is an expanding intelligence network for tree knowledge. Whether used by scientists modeling forest dynamics, land stewards planning reforestation projects, or conservationists tracking biodiversity, Treekipedia will serve as a core infrastructure layer for global reforestation intelligence.\n\n## Silvi and Treekipedia\n\nTreekipedia is developed and supported by **Silvi**, a blockchain-powered reforestation protocol. Silvi has already integrated Treekipedia as its species data source within the Silvi App, making it the authoritative knowledge base for tree intelligence in Silvi's ecosystem.\n\nTreekipedia's foundation was built through extensive data collection, cleaning, and structuring. Over the past year, the team has aggregated **25 million+ raw species records** from 10+ global biodiversity datasets, including GBIF, iNaturalist, SiBBr, and SpeciesLink. After deduplication, taxonomy validation, and synonym resolution, the dataset now includes **50,000+ unique tree species** with **17.6 million observational records**.\n\nTreekipedia's ontology is structured around 50+ taxonomic, ecological, and functional attributes, providing a standardized framework for knowledge retrieval. A custom TaxonID system ensures unique species identification and data consistency across datasets.\n\nFor decentralized access and long-term integrity, Treekipedia integrates Blazegraph for structured querying and IPFS for decentralized storage, where AI-generated research reports are permanently pinned. Additionally, species distributions are being mapped across ecoregions and biomes using OneEarth's bioregional framework, expanding interoperability with conservation and reforestation initiatives.\n\nThis foundation sets the stage for Treekipedia's next evolution—an AI-enhanced, decentralized ecosystem for tree intelligence.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nTreekipedia is being developed through a structured roadmap, progressively expanding its capabilities, refining infrastructure, and increasing community participation.\n\n### Phase 1: Treekipedia v1.0 Launch\n\n- **Tree Species Search**: A searchable database of 50,080+ species with structured taxonomy, habitat, and ecological data.\n- **Species Knowledge Pages**: Wikipedia-style entries with real-time updates as new research is conducted.\n- **AI Research Agent**: AI-driven research retrieval and structuring, filling knowledge gaps.\n- **Contreebution NFTs**: A low-cost (~$3) mechanism for users to sponsor AI-driven research.\n- **EAS & IPFS Integration**: Research data is pinned to IPFS and cryptographically attested for transparency.\n- **Treederboard**: A leaderboard showcasing contributors, incentivizing engagement.\n- **Graph Database Querying**: Structured Blazegraph-powered queries for advanced ecological insights.\n\n### Phase 2: Infrastructure Refinement & Expansion\n\n- Blazegraph API Deployment for scalable, high-performance querying.\n- Ontology & Data Versioning for structured taxonomy updates.\n- AI-Powered Data Validation to ensure research accuracy before integration.\n\n### Phase 3: Community Engagement & Governance\n\n- **Working Group Formation**: Collaboration with scientists, reforestation organizations, and conservationists.\n- **Decentralized Governance**: Expansion of EAS attestations, peer review incentives, and contribution weighting.\n- **DeepTrees NFT Collection**: Launch of the \"Iconic Species\" NFT series, integrated into governance.\n\n### Phase 4: AI & Ecological Intelligence Scaling\n\n- Advanced AI Research Agents for complex ecological modeling.\n- Automated Knowledge Updates for self-improving AI accuracy.\n- Decentralized Validation through a multi-tier credibility scoring system.\n\n### Phase 5: Full Public Rollout & Global Collaboration\n\n- Treekipedia API Launch for integration with external research platforms.\n- Silvi Integration to support MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) applications.\n- Global Partnerships with biodiversity institutions and ecological monitoring networks.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"SilviProtocol","projectTwitter":"SilviProtocol"},"metadataCid":"bafkreifllsbsmdstmjyzblxt4wpwepucfmjlwni6emfddgrhzpe2u7ewya","timestamp":"2025-03-31T19:53:41+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x4a24d4a7c36257E0bF256EA2970708817C597A2C","createdAtBlock":31550063}],"projectId":"0xd4e805402ef75b899d0ad42d8325287074da817180850fcbc177b41764637a15","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"31","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-31T20:07:13.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31550875"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-02T11:35:27.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31692969"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32213268,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-31T20:07:13+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x6572d9E700802352C232274c7aFf30405F7e6dc5","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31183741,"createdByAddress":"0x037Eb04AD9DDFf984F44Ce5941D14b8Ea3781459","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"10","metadata":{"signature":"0x6d6f90626236dc1d9dbb767c28dd5d9f4a8c570694e4ae43efc60661f3dfd561177f2544d67db8c1df7fafcc90b4cf692a733aa30900e834727565cf2c4a5b521c","application":{"round":"0x487FB600a0627b1eE95bF280C5c8Bd415E0bE58a","answers":[{"type":"email","answer":"davidmachuche@gmail.com","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0},{"type":"number","answer":"3","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":1},{"type":"checkbox","answer":["ReFi DAO"],"hidden":false,"question":"Is your project a member or past grantee of one of these networks?","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"- Use WashikaDAO as a local coordination toolkit for other regional DAOs and ReFi projects/ local nodes\n- Train & onboard at least 30 savings groups as this is new technology and onboarding will require community leaders as well\n- 200+ community members onboarded in DAO like structures eg solar savings circles.

Overview** \n\n**[ReFi Lagos](https://x.com/ReFiLagos01)** is a **ReFi DAO Local Node** and regenerative hub in Nigeria empowering climate ambassadors and nature stewards to scale climate action leveraging regenerative finance principles and technology. We seek to support indigenous people in restoring natural ecosystems and biodiversity by organizing tree planting festivals and promoting climate change education in Africa. ReFi Lagos is supported by  Gitcoin,  Regen Coordination, Silvi Protocol, and Impact Miner (Atlantis DAO)\n\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\nAfrica's climate crisis is complex. Temperatures in the Sahel region are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average due to increased urbanization and severe deforestation, both of which increase carbon emissions. \n\nDeforestation in Nigeria has led to [loss of 96% of the country's primary forest](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/deforestation-nigeria-has-lost-96-of-its-forest-ncf/). This has exacerbated climate change impacts, including biodiversity loss, heat waves, and [severe coastal erosion](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/6/1/in-oil-rich-niger-delta-coastal-erosion-is-outliving-residents)  in the country.\n![Deforestation in Nigeria](https://i.ibb.co/yRPM3DG/Gitcoin.png) \n\n**[Climate change costs Africa $15 billion per year,](https://www.afdb.org/en/cop28/focus-africa)** which exceeds the GDPs of 26 African countries. By 2050, it could reach $50 billion. Climate change impacts disadvantaged communities and threatens traditional livelihoods. With poor access to climate finance, farmers/land stewards are unable to adapt.  Addressing this issue is critical for environmental sustainability and community well-being, and we are passionate about helping to solve it. \n\n\n**Our Solution:** \nWe believe that solving global climate change requires decentralized and indigenous climate solutions. ReFi Lagos is scaling tree-planting event though research and development of **[Project Osisi](http://osisi.earth/)**\nOsisi (or tree) is an indigenous tree-planting festival that allows impact donors to efficiently support tree-planting events with real-time data and impact reports. It empowers local land stewards with tools to plant trees and capture ecological data. We’ve successfully set up a **[1040-square-meter pilot tree garden](https://tinyurl.com/OSISIGARDEN)** in Lagos to facilitate nursing of tree seedlings in Lagos.

successfully run [**23 IRL events**](https://www.regensunite.earth/#events) with a growing roster of new locations. Our curated, in-person gatherings have programs designed to guide participants through professionally facilitated discussions and knowledge-sharing experiences.\n\n- **Intimate & Intentional Event Curation** - With a team of experienced facilitators, we organise inclusive, participatory events.\n- **Facilitation & Programming Services -** We support other events through programming partnerships, facilitation training or consulting, and marketing.\n- **Educational content -** We produce digital media such as [after-movies, session recordings](https://www.youtube.com/@regensunite/videos), a newsletter, & a handbook to share learnings and support a growing network of climate-focused builders and regens.\n\n---\n\n![Our Impact](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/attachment%3Ae2af761b-0bed-4513-915d-7cad41f3edd4%3AOur_impact.svg?table=block&id=1c985972-5d29-80fd-9ab7-c5e22e9034aa&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n***Events:***\n\n# 🇹🇭 The Regen Hub at Devcon 7 SEA\n\nIn November at Devcon 7 SEA in Thailand, Regens Unite hosted the [Regen Hub](https://x.com/regensunite/status/1870082140513128700), a 4-day community-driven experience connecting Southeast Asian changemakers with the global Web3 community.\n\n- 500+ active participants\n- 200+ regens mapped\n- 30+ hours of programming\n- 25+ projects showcased\n\nThe space became a vibrant hub for collaboration, education, and exploration of regenerative work.

is a garden for researchers exploring decentralized thought movements and techno-social philosophy. Originally known as the GreenPill Chinese Community, it serves as a public space within the blockchain world where builders of public goods converge to exchange crypto-humanistic ideas.\n\nStructurally, Uncommons operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that prioritizes member welfare over institutional preservation.

Originally known as the GreenPill Chinese Community, it serves as a public space within the blockchain world where builders of public goods converge to exchange crypto-humanistic ideas.\n\nStructurally, Uncommons operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that prioritizes member welfare over institutional preservation.

***Wouldn’t it be nice to create a proactive perpetual framework backed by natural assets unrelated to the crypto market, and eco-friendly and regenerative?***\n\n## Personal Introduction 🧬\n* I’m [**Wasabi**](https://link3.to/wasabinetwork), founder at [**Kokonut Network**](https://kokonut.network/). We are [**building an ecosystem**](https://link.kokonut.network/press) to connect web3 and agriculture. \n* We have created a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of Syntropic Plantations.\n* Our main goal is to address the [**worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects**](https://youtu.be/ZjygLVUSq4s). \n* We partner with [**farmers**](https://link.kokonut.network/KKN-Seeds-Deck) to get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access & upside into perpetual natural assets.\n\n# TL;DR 🗒️\n\nKokonut Network is a decentralized ecosystem for building and deploying syntropic agroforestry farms using Web3 infrastructure. Its [open-source framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows communities to design farms [optimized for diverse funding sources](https://x.com/WasabiNetwork/status/1898000651646390343) (**grants, DAOs, cooperatives, investors**) and impact outcomes (**public goods, financial returns, or blended**). Currently operating 2 live farms and developing 4 more across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut represents a powerful example of Web3 applied to real-world ecological and economic transformation.\n\nKokonut Network leverages blockchain and **open-source accounting** to create a **community-owned** network of nature-based **sustainable assets**. Our mission is to encourage, organize, fund, and oversee purpose-based Syntropic Farms.\n\nKokonut Network forges partnerships with stakeholders through the Kokonut Framework, which utilizes a combination of Agriculture, Blockchain, Land, and Weather. \n\n> **This synergy has no expiration date ♻️**\n\n# Table of Contents 📜\n\n 1.

By supporting open-source documentation and modular deployment, we contribute directly to the broader development and adoption of ReFi systems.\n* ⚙️ **Ecosystem Activity on Celo & Ethereum:** With ongoing deployments across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and growing interest in Celo’s OP Stack migration, Kokonut is well-positioned to contribute to the expansion of financial and on-chain activity across Ethereum-aligned networks.\n* 🌱 **Local Ecological, Social, and Economic Impact:** Each Kokonut farm represents a tangible, community-led regenerative project—generating food, livelihoods, biodiversity, and revenue through eco-friendly land use. The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows customization based on funding models, enabling it to work across both grant-funded and for-profit scenarios. With 6 farms in development across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut is already catalyzing systemic change in underserved rural communities.\n\n# Quantitative & Qualitative: This is what you're helping bring to life 🌱\n\n## Kokonut Venus - Six Dimensions of Impact ♻️\n\n1. **WHAT** – The objective is to test our thesis by building and developing syntropic plantations via a community-centric model, which intersects real-life communities, web3 communities, and global culture. The outcome of this investment will create a perpetual asset that will improve people's lives in every aspect.\n2. **WHO** – The families who own the land where the project will be developed are underserved in every aspect, including education, finances, health, and opportunities. In Latin America, jobs and the economy mainly function in big cities, and the countryside is typically marginalized or taken advantage of by large corporations. A blockchain-based co-op can help remove many of these barriers.\n3. **HOW MUCH** – Approximately 3 families own the land for Kokonut Venus a 100% women-based leadership syntropic farm with 60+ direct beneficiaries looking to expand beyond fruits & vegetable by also producing organic eggs, and the project will create dozens of direct and indirect jobs. This will be life-changing for everyone, as it will provide opportunities and value for at least 10 years.\n4. **CONTRIBUTION** – Underserved individuals depend on these types of projects and new concepts that open doors to new paradigms and possibilities. The current system's criteria and entry-level are very high, making it difficult for those who cannot meet their standards.\n5. **RISK** – We have several fail safes in place, such as agricultural insurance, open-source cloud accounting systems, government and community oversight, and technical support from government agencies.\n6. **PUBLIC GOODS** – Kokonut Venus Farm will be allocating 10% of its net profits as donations toward Asociacion de Mujeres Saladilleras AMUSA (100% Women-based Local Cooperative) which the manager of Kokonut Venus is the Director and [Kokonut Foundation](https://kokonut.foundation/) to further help with their mission.\n\n# Why Kokonut Network? 🌴\n\nIn essence, Kokonut Network serves as the coordination layer that harnesses the power of web3 and open-source technologies to craft an adaptable organism capable of limitless expansion, thanks to its modular plug-and-play design framework.\n\nEvery component of our network is crafted in alignment with our [core values](https://kokonut.network/about).\n\nOur commitment extends to safeguarding the interests of minorities through a holistic approach.\n\n## 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling\n\nA global issue revolves around insufficient funding for agricultural projects, imposing immense stress on grassroots farmers. This contributes to deforestation, as people resort to using wood for cooking and cutting down trees due to limited financial incentives to protect their environment. Most of the labor is executed by farmers trapped in poverty due to the lack of avenues to improve their income. They lack the processes, knowledge, and resources necessary to compete with corporations that control over 90% of the global coconut market.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nBlockchain open data and protocols offer a solution that benefits DAO members, farmers, and partners. This involves simplifying fundraising and coordination processes while actively monitoring fauna, flora, and endangered species to create a holistic solution. Through a [framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) with bullet-proof standardized processes, we create job opportunities and enhance the quality of life for those contributing to the network's well-being. The objective is to establish a fair mechanism for funding, managing, and developing Syntropic Farms while maintaining a commitment to environmental preservation.\n\n## Why coconuts? Zero Waste & Circular Crop 🥥♻️\n\nCoconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.\n\nThe coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.\n\n> ***Coconut is a versatile fruit with many health, environmental and biodiversity benefits.***\n\n## Kokonut Ecosystem Climate Impact\n\nWe’re developing a hybrid framework to create positive community-centric impact, addressing systemic issues in underserved areas and enhancing climate resilience. Our approach focuses on sustainable solutions that improve daily lives and provide incentives without deforestation.\n\n## EBF Framework\n\nWe will track and report environmental and social impacts using the EBF Framework. Our reports, published via Karma GAP, will ensure long-term compatibility within the ReFi and Climate communities. \n\n> The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) significantly contributes to air, soil, biodiversity, equity, and carbon benefits.\n\n# Regenerative Agriculture: SDGs & 8 Forms of Capital\n\n## Value Creation in a Community-Owned Syntropic Farm\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/8%20Forms%20Diagram.png \"\")\n\n# Unlimited Scaling — Kokonut Framework Use Case; Public Goods powered by Trees 🌳\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/Diagram%20v0.2%20-%20KKN%20Foundation.png \"\")\n\n# Our Vision 🔭\n\nKokonut Network was created to [reduce the obstacles to agricultural development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjygLVUSq4s&pp=ygURa29rb251dCBleHBsYWluZXI%3D), and rural project funding, and democratize investment in real-world projects. We use blockchain technology to establish plantations, creating opportunities for the global web3 communities and everyone in the network.\n\nWhat makes us different: Many DAOs have great ideas, copywriting, and marketing but without a solid business model. Unfortunately, many of these projects are rug-pulled or abandoned by users due to a lack of quality products.\n\n---\n\n# Main Resources 🔖\n* ***Website** [https://www.kokonut.network/](https://www.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Let’s have a chat** [https://link.kokonut.network/meeting](https://link.kokonut.network/meeting)*\n* ***Tree of Links** [https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork](https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork)*\n* ***Kokonut Network Karma GAP Profile** [https://link.kokonut.network/karma](https://link.kokonut.network/karma)*\n* ***Kokonut Data Hub** [https://hub.kokonut.network/](https://hub.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Kokonut Framework Docs*** <https://framework.kokonut.network>\n* ***Adelphi 3D Land Elevation Model*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiOrtho3D>\n* ***Adelphi Species GeoNode*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiSpeciesGeoNode>\n\n> **Thank you for reading.

We are [**building an ecosystem**](https://link.kokonut.network/press) to connect web3 and agriculture. \n* We have created a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of Syntropic Plantations.\n* Our main goal is to address the [**worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects**](https://youtu.be/ZjygLVUSq4s). \n* We partner with [**farmers**](https://link.kokonut.network/KKN-Seeds-Deck) to get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access & upside into perpetual natural assets.\n\n# TL;DR 🗒️\n\nKokonut Network is a decentralized ecosystem for building and deploying syntropic agroforestry farms using Web3 infrastructure. Its [open-source framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows communities to design farms [optimized for diverse funding sources](https://x.com/WasabiNetwork/status/1898000651646390343) (**grants, DAOs, cooperatives, investors**) and impact outcomes (**public goods, financial returns, or blended**). Currently operating 2 live farms and developing 4 more across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut represents a powerful example of Web3 applied to real-world ecological and economic transformation.\n\nKokonut Network leverages blockchain and **open-source accounting** to create a **community-owned** network of nature-based **sustainable assets**. Our mission is to encourage, organize, fund, and oversee purpose-based Syntropic Farms.\n\nKokonut Network forges partnerships with stakeholders through the Kokonut Framework, which utilizes a combination of Agriculture, Blockchain, Land, and Weather. \n\n> **This synergy has no expiration date ♻️**\n\n# Table of Contents 📜\n\n 1.

By supporting open-source documentation and modular deployment, we contribute directly to the broader development and adoption of ReFi systems.\n* ⚙️ **Ecosystem Activity on Celo & Ethereum:** With ongoing deployments across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and growing interest in Celo’s OP Stack migration, Kokonut is well-positioned to contribute to the expansion of financial and on-chain activity across Ethereum-aligned networks.\n* 🌱 **Local Ecological, Social, and Economic Impact:** Each Kokonut farm represents a tangible, community-led regenerative project—generating food, livelihoods, biodiversity, and revenue through eco-friendly land use. The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows customization based on funding models, enabling it to work across both grant-funded and for-profit scenarios. With 6 farms in development across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut is already catalyzing systemic change in underserved rural communities.\n\n# Quantitative & Qualitative: This is what you're helping bring to life 🌱\n\n## Kokonut Venus - Six Dimensions of Impact ♻️\n\n1. **WHAT** – The objective is to test our thesis by building and developing syntropic plantations via a community-centric model, which intersects real-life communities, web3 communities, and global culture. The outcome of this investment will create a perpetual asset that will improve people's lives in every aspect.\n2. **WHO** – The families who own the land where the project will be developed are underserved in every aspect, including education, finances, health, and opportunities. In Latin America, jobs and the economy mainly function in big cities, and the countryside is typically marginalized or taken advantage of by large corporations. A blockchain-based co-op can help remove many of these barriers.\n3. **HOW MUCH** – Approximately 3 families own the land for Kokonut Venus a 100% women-based leadership syntropic farm with 60+ direct beneficiaries looking to expand beyond fruits & vegetable by also producing organic eggs, and the project will create dozens of direct and indirect jobs. This will be life-changing for everyone, as it will provide opportunities and value for at least 10 years.\n4. **CONTRIBUTION** – Underserved individuals depend on these types of projects and new concepts that open doors to new paradigms and possibilities. The current system's criteria and entry-level are very high, making it difficult for those who cannot meet their standards.\n5. **RISK** – We have several fail safes in place, such as agricultural insurance, open-source cloud accounting systems, government and community oversight, and technical support from government agencies.\n6. **PUBLIC GOODS** – Kokonut Venus Farm will be allocating 10% of its net profits as donations toward Asociacion de Mujeres Saladilleras AMUSA (100% Women-based Local Cooperative) which the manager of Kokonut Venus is the Director and [Kokonut Foundation](https://kokonut.foundation/) to further help with their mission.\n\n# Why Kokonut Network? 🌴\n\nIn essence, Kokonut Network serves as the coordination layer that harnesses the power of web3 and open-source technologies to craft an adaptable organism capable of limitless expansion, thanks to its modular plug-and-play design framework.\n\nEvery component of our network is crafted in alignment with our [core values](https://kokonut.network/about).\n\nOur commitment extends to safeguarding the interests of minorities through a holistic approach.\n\n## 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling\n\nA global issue revolves around insufficient funding for agricultural projects, imposing immense stress on grassroots farmers. This contributes to deforestation, as people resort to using wood for cooking and cutting down trees due to limited financial incentives to protect their environment. Most of the labor is executed by farmers trapped in poverty due to the lack of avenues to improve their income. They lack the processes, knowledge, and resources necessary to compete with corporations that control over 90% of the global coconut market.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nBlockchain open data and protocols offer a solution that benefits DAO members, farmers, and partners. This involves simplifying fundraising and coordination processes while actively monitoring fauna, flora, and endangered species to create a holistic solution. Through a [framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) with bullet-proof standardized processes, we create job opportunities and enhance the quality of life for those contributing to the network's well-being. The objective is to establish a fair mechanism for funding, managing, and developing Syntropic Farms while maintaining a commitment to environmental preservation.\n\n## Why coconuts? Zero Waste & Circular Crop 🥥♻️\n\nCoconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.\n\nThe coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.\n\n> ***Coconut is a versatile fruit with many health, environmental and biodiversity benefits.***\n\n## Kokonut Ecosystem Climate Impact\n\nWe’re developing a hybrid framework to create positive community-centric impact, addressing systemic issues in underserved areas and enhancing climate resilience. Our approach focuses on sustainable solutions that improve daily lives and provide incentives without deforestation.\n\n## EBF Framework\n\nWe will track and report environmental and social impacts using the EBF Framework. Our reports, published via Karma GAP, will ensure long-term compatibility within the ReFi and Climate communities. \n\n> The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) significantly contributes to air, soil, biodiversity, equity, and carbon benefits.\n\n# Regenerative Agriculture: SDGs & 8 Forms of Capital\n\n## Value Creation in a Community-Owned Syntropic Farm\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/8%20Forms%20Diagram.png \"\")\n\n# Unlimited Scaling — Kokonut Framework Use Case; Public Goods powered by Trees 🌳\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/Diagram%20v0.2%20-%20KKN%20Foundation.png \"\")\n\n# Our Vision 🔭\n\nKokonut Network was created to [reduce the obstacles to agricultural development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjygLVUSq4s&pp=ygURa29rb251dCBleHBsYWluZXI%3D), and rural project funding, and democratize investment in real-world projects. We use blockchain technology to establish plantations, creating opportunities for the global web3 communities and everyone in the network.\n\nWhat makes us different: Many DAOs have great ideas, copywriting, and marketing but without a solid business model. Unfortunately, many of these projects are rug-pulled or abandoned by users due to a lack of quality products.\n\n---\n\n# Main Resources 🔖\n* ***Website** [https://www.kokonut.network/](https://www.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Let’s have a chat** [https://link.kokonut.network/meeting](https://link.kokonut.network/meeting)*\n* ***Tree of Links** [https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork](https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork)*\n* ***Kokonut Network Karma GAP Profile** [https://link.kokonut.network/karma](https://link.kokonut.network/karma)*\n* ***Kokonut Data Hub** [https://hub.kokonut.network/](https://hub.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Kokonut Framework Docs*** <https://framework.kokonut.network>\n* ***Adelphi 3D Land Elevation Model*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiOrtho3D>\n* ***Adelphi Species GeoNode*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiSpeciesGeoNode>\n\n> **Thank you for reading.

RB is a groundbreaking protocol for tokenizing and trading real-world impact (RWI) products. It bridges traditional public goods projects with Web3, enabling transparent verification and monetization of impact through blockchain technology. The platform empowers impact creators while rewarding supporters, creating a sustainable ecosystem for public goods funding.\n\n# Regen Bazaar: Tokenizing Real-World Impact for Public Goods\n\n## Overview\nRegen Bazaar is where real-world positive impact meets blockchain technology. Think of us as a digital marketplace where good deeds and real impactful projects (RWI)  can be turned into tradeable digital assets. Whether it's community cleanups, reforestation efforts, or animal welfare projects - we help bring these meaningful activities onto the blockchain where they can be supported, tracked, and rewarded.\n\n## Why Does This Matter?\nLet's face it - doing good for the world often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. We've noticed some big problems in this space:\n\n- Great projects often stay hidden in their local communities, never getting the attention they deserve\n- It's really hard to show and measure the actual impact of good work\n- People who want to support meaningful projects struggle to find and verify them\n- Amazing initiatives frequently struggle to get funding, even when they're doing incredible work\n\n## How We're Fixing This\nHere's how Regen Bazaar is changing the game:\n\n### 1. Making Impact Visible and Valuable\nImagine turning a beach cleanup or a tree-planting project into something you can actually show and share online. That's what we do! We help:\n- Convert real-world impact into digital tokens that represent the actual work done\n- Make it easy to measure and verify the good being done\n- Create a way for impact creators to get recognized and rewarded\n\n### 2. One Place for All Things Impact\nWe're building the \"Amazon of impact projects\" where:\n- Anyone can discover amazing projects making real change\n- Project creators can showcase their work to the world\n- Supporters can easily find and back projects they believe in\n- Everything is transparent and verifiable\n\n### 3. Rewards for Doing Good\nEveryone who participates gets something back:\n- Project creators get recognition and support\n- Supporters earn rewards for backing good causes\n- The more you participate, the more benefits you receive\n- Easy tools to track and manage your impact\n\n## Under the Hood\nWe use some pretty cool technology to make this all work:\n- Special digital tokens (like digital certificates) for unique impact projects\n- Secure vaults to hold and manage impact investments\n- Fair systems to share benefits with project creators and Supports in form of $REBAZ tokens\n- Community-driven decision making\n\n## What Makes Us Special\n1. **Creating Digital Impact Certificates**\n   - Turn real-world good deeds into digital assets\n   - Each impact gets its own score based on real results with our proprietary formulas to score.\n   - Everything is verified and transparent\n\n2. **A Marketplace That Makes Sense**\n   -

It bridges traditional public goods projects with Web3, enabling transparent verification and monetization of impact through blockchain technology. The platform empowers impact creators while rewarding supporters, creating a sustainable ecosystem for public goods funding.\n\n# Regen Bazaar: Tokenizing Real-World Impact for Public Goods\n\n## Overview\nRegen Bazaar is where real-world positive impact meets blockchain technology. Think of us as a digital marketplace where good deeds and real impactful projects (RWI)  can be turned into tradeable digital assets. Whether it's community cleanups, reforestation efforts, or animal welfare projects - we help bring these meaningful activities onto the blockchain where they can be supported, tracked, and rewarded.\n\n## Why Does This Matter?\nLet's face it - doing good for the world often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. We've noticed some big problems in this space:\n\n- Great projects often stay hidden in their local communities, never getting the attention they deserve\n- It's really hard to show and measure the actual impact of good work\n- People who want to support meaningful projects struggle to find and verify them\n- Amazing initiatives frequently struggle to get funding, even when they're doing incredible work\n\n## How We're Fixing This\nHere's how Regen Bazaar is changing the game:\n\n### 1. Making Impact Visible and Valuable\nImagine turning a beach cleanup or a tree-planting project into something you can actually show and share online. That's what we do! We help:\n- Convert real-world impact into digital tokens that represent the actual work done\n- Make it easy to measure and verify the good being done\n- Create a way for impact creators to get recognized and rewarded\n\n### 2. One Place for All Things Impact\nWe're building the \"Amazon of impact projects\" where:\n- Anyone can discover amazing projects making real change\n- Project creators can showcase their work to the world\n- Supporters can easily find and back projects they believe in\n- Everything is transparent and verifiable\n\n### 3. Rewards for Doing Good\nEveryone who participates gets something back:\n- Project creators get recognition and support\n- Supporters earn rewards for backing good causes\n- The more you participate, the more benefits you receive\n- Easy tools to track and manage your impact\n\n## Under the Hood\nWe use some pretty cool technology to make this all work:\n- Special digital tokens (like digital certificates) for unique impact projects\n- Secure vaults to hold and manage impact investments\n- Fair systems to share benefits with project creators and Supports in form of $REBAZ tokens\n- Community-driven decision making\n\n## What Makes Us Special\n1. **Creating Digital Impact Certificates**\n   - Turn real-world good deeds into digital assets\n   - Each impact gets its own score based on real results with our proprietary formulas to score.\n   - Everything is verified and transparent\n\n2. **A Marketplace That Makes Sense**\n   - Easy to find and support projects you care about\n   - Simple trading of impact certificates\n   - Clear ways to help fund important work\n\n3. **Built for Everyone**\n   - Simple tools to manage your impact\n   - Clear tracking of where your support goes\n   - Fair distribution of rewards\n\n## Where We Are Now\n- Check out our working demo at [demo.regenbazaar.com](https://demo.regenbazaar.com)\n- See our progress on

Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.\n\nIntroduction\nThe town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000 hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.\n\nWhat Has Been Accomplished \nWe successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15), $14,000 in the alpha round, and $8,000 in the beta round. With these funds we have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work while supporting all of the projects listed above. \n\nProjects we are supporting include:\n\n1.\t The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.\n\n2.\tA community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that prototypes alternative economic models and hosts local exchanges among more than 80 local producers in the community.\n\n3.\tA community reforestation project called Bioparque Móncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.\n\n4.\tThe construction of a community theater called Caney Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts – all in service to regeneration of the territory.\n\n5.\tThe Origen del Agua Nature Reserve that is reforesting 3.2 hectares of heavily degraded land with native plant species while working with a local school to bring campesino children into the learning process.\n\nWith funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving this tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through the Design School for Regenerating Earth and a variety of social media channels.\n\nVision\nAll the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.\n\nLearn More\nBRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others’ experiences. He is also co-founder alongside Penny Heiple and Benji Ross of the Design School for Regenerating Earth. \n\nTo learn more about regenerative work in Barichara visit: https://www.regeneratebarichara.org\n\nTo learn more about Earth Regenerators visit: \nhttps://earth-regenerators.mn.co/\n\nTo learn more about the Design School for Regenerating Earth visit: \nhttps://design-school-for-regenerating-earth.mn.co/","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"cognitivepolicy"},"recipient":"0xFd9F8A0f4bdEaC72F08AF1c708023cC31dD2E3BE"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiefm4vm5f67nfzfjbavad6ohmwvlvaz2hrxnmdl5qlj4wtgobhpvq","projects":[{"name":"Barichara Regeneration Fund – Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy","id":"0x8991371ae6879b44257ff36116d7332917450cf7535d75d07495a709e1287dbc","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Barichara Regeneration Fund – Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy","logoImg":"bafybeigeqhk7tfc7f52pg2jkcai54gkqwpj3r6bhcko3uc356nj25tn67a","website":"https://www.regeneratebarichara.org","bannerImg":"bafybeifxcep64xyzluvcmmvnlkd6c4mhv6fuflm5gn33gwl7yt4lhbjxgy","createdAt":1673378762611,"userGithub":"circlejoe","credentials":{},"description":"About\nThe Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale.

This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.\n\nWhat Has Been Accomplished \nWe successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15), $14,000 in the alpha round, and $8,000 in the beta round. With these funds we have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work while supporting all of the projects listed above. \n\nProjects we are supporting include:\n\n1.\t The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.\n\n2.\tA community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that prototypes alternative economic models and hosts local exchanges among more than 80 local producers in the community.\n\n3.\tA community reforestation project called Bioparque Móncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.\n\n4.\tThe construction of a community theater called Caney Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts – all in service to regeneration of the territory.\n\n5.\tThe Origen del Agua Nature Reserve that is reforesting 3.2 hectares of heavily degraded land with native plant species while working with a local school to bring campesino children into the learning process.\n\nWith funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving this tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through the Design School for Regenerating Earth and a variety of social media channels.\n\nVision\nAll the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.\n\nLearn More\nBRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others’ experiences. He is also co-founder alongside Penny Heiple and Benji Ross of the Design School for Regenerating Earth. \n\nTo learn more about regenerative work in Barichara visit: https://www.regeneratebarichara.org\n\nTo learn more about Earth Regenerators visit: \nhttps://earth-regenerators.mn.co/\n\nTo learn more about the Design School for Regenerating Earth visit: \nhttps://design-school-for-regenerating-earth.mn.co/","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"cognitivepolicy"},"metadataCid":"bafkreic265ik3awpjiw3bozuctpsmlznihbxmmk55neojiy6wvcype2rgu","timestamp":"2024-03-20T06:47:24+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x8C180840fcBb90CE8464B4eCd12ab0f840c6647C","createdAtBlock":192252778},{"name":"Barichara Regeneration Fund – Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy","id":"0x8991371ae6879b44257ff36116d7332917450cf7535d75d07495a709e1287dbc","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreibcmipfzj764luh5clfq24atkiaggl6n7d275rtyyeeo5hbmnc76i","timestamp":"2025-04-03T11:13:19+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xFd9F8A0f4bdEaC72F08AF1c708023cC31dD2E3BE","createdAtBlock":31778041}],"projectId":"0x8991371ae6879b44257ff36116d7332917450cf7535d75d07495a709e1287dbc","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"31","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-04-03T11:13:30.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31778052"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2025-04-07T18:17:51.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"32149113"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32213268,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-04-03T11:13:30+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":215.72359,"totalDonationsCount":38,"uniqueDonorsCount":38},{"anchorAddress":"0x2d1D1364111df24E756C2c297b543bf551276398","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":32132614,"createdByAddress":"0x243d606E4bdb32995e62E2C1126c499590c599E6","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"73","metadata":{"signature":"0xe6ff4e2c6d1093b7d3d2e2b1e0257ff0afe822da9adffe6c678a731eb1e98fcd1480506c514b145afe196b190b09d4e8eed896e1c2847b10aa4b769127c8d1b51b","application":{"round":"0x487FB600a0627b1eE95bF280C5c8Bd415E0bE58a","answers":[{"type":"email","answer":"writeprovidence@gmail.com","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0},{"type":"number","answer":"3","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":1},{"type":"checkbox","answer":["Not formally"],"hidden":false,"question":"Is your project a member or past grantee of one of these networks?","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":" Key Goals, Plans, Objectives & Milestones for 2025\n 1.

Project Overview  \nReFi Medellín’s open-source lending platform, launched in December 2023, offers a transparent, decentralized lending system designed to expand financial inclusion in Medellín. Our platform provides **low-interest, collateral-free loans** to support essential needs like healthcare, education, and daily expenses, strengthening individuals and the community within a **decentralized, community-focused model**. Operating on **Celo, Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum networks**, with loans provided in **GloDollar (USDGLO)**, ReFi Medellín is pioneering accessible financial solutions tailored for underserved communities.\n\n## How It Works  \nOur lending platform emphasizes community engagement and decentralized governance. To qualify for a loan, applicants must:\n- Be actively involved in ReFi Medellín,\n- Attend at least three community events, and\n- Have three endorsers from the community who hold a ReFi Medellín NFT.\n\nOnce these requirements are met, applicants submit their wallet and endorser addresses. This decentralized, community-based model fosters trust and accountability, while platform governance remains transparent and member-driven.\n\n## Affordable Interest Rates  \nWith a **0.5% interest rate**, the lending platform provides loans at a significantly reduced cost, promoting financial stability and allowing members to achieve their goals without facing the burden of high-interest debt.\n\n## Combating Predatory Lending  \nIn Colombia and throughout Latin America, informal “gota a gota” loans frequently trap individuals in high-interest debt cycles that lead to exploitation and violence. Our platform offers a secure, low-cost alternative, empowering community members to avoid these predatory practices and build financial resilience.\n\n## Long-Term Impact  \nEach repaid loan strengthens the platform, circulating financial resources within the community to support a sustainable, regenerative ecosystem. This cycle fosters a supportive network, enabling continued access to credit and reinvestment in the community’s social and economic well-being.\n\n## Alignment with GG22 OSS Round Goals\n1. **User-Centric Design**: The platform is designed for accessibility, with simple lending criteria and a low-barrier interface ideal for Web3 newcomers.\n2. **Ecosystem Growth**: By integrating decentralized finance into community activities, ReFi Medellín broadens Web3 access, creating inclusive opportunities in an underserved region.\n3. **Innovative Use Case**: The collateral-free, reputation-based model using GloDollar offers a safe alternative to traditional and informal loans.\n4. **Open Source Commitment**: Fully open-source, ReFi Medellín prioritizes transparency, ethical practices, and adaptability, serving as a model for community-focused financial technology.\n\n## Objective for Funding  \nThis funding will allow us to:\n- **Enhance platform usability** for new users,\n- **Expand liquidity and outreach**, supporting a wider range of community loans,\n- **Scale educational efforts** to equip users with skills to engage in decentralized finance.\n\n## Conclusion  \nReFi Medellín’s lending platform is a transformative tool for community empowerment and financial inclusion.

We are a local Chapter within the broader **GreenPill Network**, with a mission of turning Degens into Regens.\n\nWe started this community with an aim at fostering a resilient and inclusive local economy through innovative technology and community engagement. Our primary focus is on running a **weekly meetup** for all web3 builders  in Toronto, where we coordinate, help each other and generally chat about how we can make the world a better place. We call it **\"web3 for good\"**, to distinguish it from the crypto-bros who are more interested in price action and shilling. These meetups have been running weekly **since Aug 2024**.\n\n**We also build.** Our projects focus around creating a **local circular economy** that emphasizes gifting, donations, and tipping, with a particular emphasis on supporting panhandlers and vulnerable populations. By leveraging blockchain technology and digital platforms, GreenPill TO strives to make financial transactions more accessible and impactful for everyone in the community - regardless of their prior knowledge of crypto and with no need to learn anything about blockchain unless they want to.\n\n\n## Mission\n\nOur mission at GreenPill TO is to **build a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable local economy in Toronto**. We aim to harness the power of web3 technology to create **post-capitalist financial tools** that empower individuals, support local businesses, and foster a culture of giving and community support. Through our initiatives, we strive to turn the tide on economic disparity and ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age. \n\nGreenPill TO endeavors to reclaim the positive potential of cryptocurrency, providing a safe haven for ethical innovators to connect, collaborate, and create solutions that benefit society as a whole.\n\n\n## Problem\n\nThe broader world of cryptocurrency faces significant challenges. Many people associate crypto with scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes, which has tarnished its reputation. Crypto is seen as out of reach from those who could benefit from it the most, when so many projects assume that you start with money to \"invest\" in their ponzis and rugpulls. \n\nDespite this, a substantial community of individuals remain who see the potential of blockchain technology to drive positive social change. However, these well-meaning individuals often lack a safe, trustworthy space to collaborate and develop their ideas. GreenPill TO seeks to fill this void by providing a reliable community and platform where ethical and impactful projects can thrive.\n\n## Solution\n\nGreenPill TO addresses these problems by providing a **community for value-aligned hackers, dreamers and doers**. We help each other by coming together frequently and coordinating. We ideate, architect problem solve together. We manage, participate in and sponsor hackathon projects and BUIDLs. We develop a suite of digital tools designed to facilitate easy and secure transactions. Join us on Luma: https://lu.ma/GreenPillTO\n\n\n## Projects\n\nWe are involved in running four concurrent flagship projects:\n\n1. **CUBID Protocol**, a proof-of-personhood and bot-proofing protocols with easy APIs for develpers to leverage. https://www.cubid.me/\n2. **The Toronto Coin**, a local cryptocurrency that encourages spending within the community. https://www.tcoin.me/\n3. **ChainCrew**, a platform for \"web2 DAOs\", allowing anyone to create and set up their own \"Crew\" within which anyone can handle real money in a DAO-like setting with community and governance features. https://chaincrew.xyz/\n4. **Tipping & Panhandler App** that enables digital tipping and donations. https://www.sparechange.tips/\n\nThese tools ensure that people of Toronto (and the world) can self-organize and self-govern.

**1. Project Overview**\n\nThe **Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS)** is a grassroots organization based in the Carolinian Canada bioregion, headquartered in London, Ontario - the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, The Haudenosaunee and the Lenaapeewak.\n\nSince 2018, ICS has worked on practical community-driven solutions in environmental sustainability and circular economies - operating a thriving Repair Café program, a Thing Library with 500+ items, and a community hub space.\n\nICS collaborates closely with SuperBenefit DAO and is a lead implementation partner in the **[Reimagining Power Project (RPP)](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/kLXz9vMGA9Au3y3Ug2VoHDLNWJwId66Hmm39vuF9ntE)**, a two-year initiative exploring Web3-powered funding, governance, and knowledge exchange for community resilience. \n\nICS is also experimenting with DAO formation, hypercerts, impact tracking, and on-chain compensation, while engaging with global ReFi networks through events like [GFAL](https://www.warmertogether.ca/panels) and [GFEL](https://x.com/MontyMerlin/status/1894123402354725299). ICS DAO is now actively building open-source playbooks to support the adoption of Web3 tools in local social impact contexts.\n\n#### **🔗 Key Links**\n\n- Website: [communitysustainability.ca](https://communitysustainability.ca/)\n- Strategic Plan: [ICS 2025–2030 Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZ-Z4KtnaTsurHNjUhs-y8-2GzQSyrNO/view)\n- SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden: [knowledge.superbenefit.org](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org/)\n- Reimagining Power Project: [Mirror update](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/kLXz9vMGA9Au3y3Ug2VoHDLNWJwId66Hmm39vuF9ntE)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Partnership Potential**\n\nICS is being considered as one of the additional projects for Regen Coordination GG23 based on its strong alignment with Regen Coordination’s mission and potential to contribute meaningfully to the regenerative finance ecosystem. \n\nIts deep integration of circular economy practices, grassroots experimentation with Web3 tools, and commitment to knowledge sharing position ICS as a valuable partner in advancing regenerative coordination strategies - especially for the Local ReFi Toolkit and Ethereum Localism infrastructure.

Project Overview**\n\nThe **Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS)** is a grassroots organization based in the Carolinian Canada bioregion, headquartered in London, Ontario - the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, The Haudenosaunee and the Lenaapeewak.\n\nSince 2018, ICS has worked on practical community-driven solutions in environmental sustainability and circular economies - operating a thriving Repair Café program, a Thing Library with 500+ items, and a community hub space.\n\nICS collaborates closely with SuperBenefit DAO and is a lead implementation partner in the **[Reimagining Power Project (RPP)](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/kLXz9vMGA9Au3y3Ug2VoHDLNWJwId66Hmm39vuF9ntE)**, a two-year initiative exploring Web3-powered funding, governance, and knowledge exchange for community resilience. \n\nICS is also experimenting with DAO formation, hypercerts, impact tracking, and on-chain compensation, while engaging with global ReFi networks through events like [GFAL](https://www.warmertogether.ca/panels) and [GFEL](https://x.com/MontyMerlin/status/1894123402354725299). ICS DAO is now actively building open-source playbooks to support the adoption of Web3 tools in local social impact contexts.\n\n#### **🔗 Key Links**\n\n- Website: [communitysustainability.ca](https://communitysustainability.ca/)\n- Strategic Plan: [ICS 2025–2030 Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZ-Z4KtnaTsurHNjUhs-y8-2GzQSyrNO/view)\n- SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden: [knowledge.superbenefit.org](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org/)\n- Reimagining Power Project: [Mirror update](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/kLXz9vMGA9Au3y3Ug2VoHDLNWJwId66Hmm39vuF9ntE)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Partnership Potential**\n\nICS is being considered as one of the additional projects for Regen Coordination GG23 based on its strong alignment with Regen Coordination’s mission and potential to contribute meaningfully to the regenerative finance ecosystem. \n\nIts deep integration of circular economy practices, grassroots experimentation with Web3 tools, and commitment to knowledge sharing position ICS as a valuable partner in advancing regenerative coordination strategies - especially for the Local ReFi Toolkit and Ethereum Localism infrastructure. This collaboration explores pathways for mutual learning, playbook development, and coalition building.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Participants include a futures-trained art professor, an artist that experiments with biofabricated textiles and sustainable fashion, a researcher writing on the future of nation-states and economies, and a mindfulness retreat practitioner.. Through this gathering, we will create different speculative design frameworks and artifacts, including contemplating regenerative spatial governance, the physicality of an aging rural site and its surrounding ecology.\n\n- Engage the community with public workshops on regenerative materials and traditional craft including bamboo-based design and bio-yarn & biodegradable prototyping\n\n- Facilitate a group build constructing a teahouse built entirely from wood donated by a local farmer, and led by a craftsman trained on Japanese wooden joinery techniques\n\n- Expand community stewardship of abandoned land and properties: Support and document the stewardship of additional akiya (abandoned) homes, adding to our current network of 5 properties in our core neighborhood (Komoro, Nagano), and 5 “sister akiyas” in satellite regions: Fukuoka, Osaka, Okayama, and other parts of Nagano. We aim to assist new stewards in home acquisition, local integration, and responsible renovation.\n\n- Create an educational art installation: Create a site-specific, community-built installation focused on regenerative uses of land and materials, preservation of artifacts, and rural storytelling through spatial design.\n\n- Publish a replicable blueprint for revitalization: Add to our existing operational playbook, a field guide to regenerative rural coordination, covering governance design templates, renovation & waste management best practices, legal & logistical tips for working with municipalities and property owners, principles of place-based public goods design.

Growing up, I was driven by a desire to address the improper waste disposal practices in my community.\n\nInspired by my passion for environmental health, proper waste management, and recycling advocacy, I initiated Vi-Clean Services to inspire change in my community. The prevalent practice of openly disposing waste on road pavements and illegal dumpsites motivated me to take action.\n\nTo tackle this issue, I began distributing free garbage bags to homes, student lodges, and apartments.

The prevalent practice of openly disposing waste on road pavements and illegal dumpsites motivated me to take action.\n\nTo tackle this issue, I began distributing free garbage bags to homes, student lodges, and apartments.

Particularly through participatory activities and capacity-building. We invite these groups to consider:**\n>*What does a regenerative future for our bioregion look like? If people were resourced to make this happen, how can this have the most impact and connect regenerators on the ground with funders and the technology we need, as best determined by the people doing the work? How do we build the buy-in and consent of our communities? And lastly, how do we use this “moment” to lead to a regenerative future rather than see it fizzle away?*\n\nThe mission of Regenerate Cascadia is to regenerate the Cascadia bioregion and create the conditions for a regenerative culture to thrive. As part of this, we educate about bioregionalism, grow the shared context of our place, and give direct funding for the core capacity of teams and projects. We provide much-needed administrative scaffolding as groups are beginning so they can receive and leverage decentralized flow funding and spin out new bioregional initiatives as part of a shared, coherent, multi-generational regeneration strategy.\n\nThis first funding round will assist our watershed working groups in locations throughout Cascadia and help us experiment with new forms of shared governance and participatory budgeting processes at the landscape level.\n\n# Now, we need your help to connect on-the-ground regenerative organizers, projects, and communities with the power and tools of Web3. \n\n![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/667c5f66bb46f07b901872e9_what-is-bff-3-layer-image-2-1024x775.png)\n*Figure 2: What is a BFF from the BioFi website - https://biofi.earth*\n\nWeb3 can help break down and move past arbitrary boundaries, map what is important to our communities, identify what needs to be protected, and connect portfolios of projects in the context of an entire landscape in ways we can directly fund and de-risk. We need to create tools for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) built through community consent and data sovereignty that help tell the stories of stewardship in ways that catalyze financial flows. \n\n**We deeply believe in the founding beliefs of these tools, as outlined by Celo:** \n>Web3 represents an internet where users have more control over their data, identity, and digital assets. This means no central authority controls the network, allowing for more transparency, security, and ownership. Web3 empowers individuals by giving them full control over their digital assets (like cryptocurrencies and NFTs) and how they interact with online services, making it a key shift towards a more open, user-owned internet.

It has an economy generating more than 1.613147 trillion worth of goods and services annually, making it the world's ninth-largest economy and roughly equivalent to that of Canada or Italy. Its population would be similar in size to Ecuador, Zambia, Cambodia, or the Netherlands. Cascadia contains the largest tracts of untouched old-growth temperate rainforests in the world, including 7 of the top 10 world carbon-absorbing forests, the world's tallest trees, thousands of volcanoes, hot springs, rivers, lakes, inlets, islands, and ocean, and some of the last diminishing, though still impressive wild habitats of salmon, wolves, bear, whale, orca.

Particularly through participatory activities and capacity-building. We invite these groups to consider:**\n>*What does a regenerative future for our bioregion look like? If people were resourced to make this happen, how can this have the most impact and connect regenerators on the ground with funders and the technology we need, as best determined by the people doing the work? How do we build the buy-in and consent of our communities? And lastly, how do we use this “moment” to lead to a regenerative future rather than see it fizzle away?*\n\nThe mission of Regenerate Cascadia is to regenerate the Cascadia bioregion and create the conditions for a regenerative culture to thrive. As part of this, we educate about bioregionalism, grow the shared context of our place, and give direct funding for the core capacity of teams and projects. We provide much-needed administrative scaffolding as groups are beginning so they can receive and leverage decentralized flow funding and spin out new bioregional initiatives as part of a shared, coherent, multi-generational regeneration strategy.\n\nThis first funding round will assist our watershed working groups in locations throughout Cascadia and help us experiment with new forms of shared governance and participatory budgeting processes at the landscape level.\n\n# Now, we need your help to connect on-the-ground regenerative organizers, projects, and communities with the power and tools of Web3. \n\n![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/667c5f66bb46f07b901872e9_what-is-bff-3-layer-image-2-1024x775.png)\n*Figure 2: What is a BFF from the BioFi website - https://biofi.earth*\n\nWeb3 can help break down and move past arbitrary boundaries, map what is important to our communities, identify what needs to be protected, and connect portfolios of projects in the context of an entire landscape in ways we can directly fund and de-risk. We need to create tools for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) built through community consent and data sovereignty that help tell the stories of stewardship in ways that catalyze financial flows. \n\n**We deeply believe in the founding beliefs of these tools, as outlined by Celo:** \n>Web3 represents an internet where users have more control over their data, identity, and digital assets. This means no central authority controls the network, allowing for more transparency, security, and ownership. Web3 empowers individuals by giving them full control over their digital assets (like cryptocurrencies and NFTs) and how they interact with online services, making it a key shift towards a more open, user-owned internet.

Early trials include testing swarm logic with simulated smart home ecosystems, tracking algorithm accuracy and response times, and analyzing user interaction patterns. These efforts validate our tech’s potential to scale across e-commerce, smart homes, and future physical commerce applications.\n\nOur go-to-market strategy unfolds in three phases. Phase 1 (2025) targets TikTok Shop, leveraging its global creator economy for initial user traction. We’re developing integrations and crafting marketing campaigns to onboard early adopters, gathering real-time data to refine our AI and user experience. Phase 2 (2026) extends into smart home systems, where we’re researching integration protocols with device ecosystems, aiming to embed deal discovery into daily environments—especially in high-growth markets like Beijing’s smart tech sector. Phase 3 (2027+) explores humanoid robot applications, with preliminary studies underway to bridge online and offline commerce and aiming to demonstrate Commerce Brain Grid’s adaptability to physical commerce interfaces as robotics adoption rises.\n\nCurrently pre-revenue, we’re channeling efforts into R&D and user acquisition groundwork. Initial customer acquisition efforts are focused on preparing for our Phase 1 TikTok Shop launch. We are growing our online presence via social media to generate buzz and build anticipation for the launch.

Let's GROW!\n\nSince GG20, we’ve planted 60,000 mangrove trees, we have built an API for our AI tree counting tool & Jimi the founder has officially broken the Guinness World Record for most trees planted in 24 hours by planting 30,469 mangroves! \n\n![GWR](https://i.postimg.cc/v8W0tkjd/Jimi-World-record-Photo.jpg)\n\nWe are soon launching our OS Technology to empower the Regen movement to break the next World Record - Most Trees Planted In a Day by Any Number of People, which is 560M trees! Our ambitious goal is 1B mangroves on Earth Day 2025. \n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/wMRQs0bw/Treegens-Banner-01.png)\n\n### 🌳 THE CHALLENGE 🌳\n\n**Misaligned Incentives**\n\nOur economy currently values the degeneration of nature more than it values the regeneration of nature. According to the UNEP, approximately 1.9 billion trees are planted yearly, yet approx. 15 billion are cut down each year. We Are losing forests at a rate equivalent to 27 soccer fields per minute! \n\n**Impact Transparency**\n\nThe impact sector faces criticism for not providing enough transparency.

The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\n# Background\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations. As one of the pioneers in Public Goods, GreenPill would like to share its experience and develop local chapters for different cities over the world.\n\nWhen two communities connected with each other, the idea of Taiwan Chapter was born.\n\nMission & Vision, Value alignment\n\nGreen Sofa aligns with the mission and vision of GreenPill, which is to build a global network society transcending national and cultural boundaries, while exporting regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.\n\nAs one team under FAB DAO, Green Sofa aims to explore the possiblity of collaboration wtih GreenPill international and FAB DAO. It is a school for FAB DAO learning from GreenPill about Public Goods, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack. It is also a laboratory for FAB DAO to apply the knowledge, kick off hands-on projects in smaller scale, to gain local experiences and feedback to FAB DAO and GreenPill.\n\nCritical success factors\n\nIncrease awareness of the GreenPill and look for collaboration opportunity with FAB DAO\n\nLearn and apply GreenPill related tools and knowledge to support FAB DAO development, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack, Hypercert.\n\nAct as the communication channel between FAB DAO and GreenPill International and other local chapters.\n\n# Hypercert project: Tamagochi at Riverside\n\nProject Website: https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region\n\n# 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling  \nIn rapidly urbanized cities like Taipei, rivers are often overlooked, over-dredged, and stripped of biodiversity. The Huangxi River (Southern Sulfur Creek), once teeming with life, has seen its ecosystem disrupted by aggressive vegetation clearing and human detachment. Shy native species like the White-breasted Waterhen have nearly vanished from view. If we don't act now, we risk losing not only vital habitats but also the community's connection to the very nature flowing beside them.\n\n---\n\n# 📜 Our Solution  \n**Tamagochi at Riverside** brings together environmental education, civic action, and Web3 technology to rewild our imaginations—and our rivers.

The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\n# Background\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations. As one of the pioneers in Public Goods, GreenPill would like to share its experience and develop local chapters for different cities over the world.\n\nWhen two communities connected with each other, the idea of Taiwan Chapter was born.\n\nMission & Vision, Value alignment\n\nGreen Sofa aligns with the mission and vision of GreenPill, which is to build a global network society transcending national and cultural boundaries, while exporting regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.\n\nAs one team under FAB DAO, Green Sofa aims to explore the possiblity of collaboration wtih GreenPill international and FAB DAO. It is a school for FAB DAO learning from GreenPill about Public Goods, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack. It is also a laboratory for FAB DAO to apply the knowledge, kick off hands-on projects in smaller scale, to gain local experiences and feedback to FAB DAO and GreenPill.\n\nCritical success factors\n\nIncrease awareness of the GreenPill and look for collaboration opportunity with FAB DAO\n\nLearn and apply GreenPill related tools and knowledge to support FAB DAO development, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack, Hypercert.\n\nAct as the communication channel between FAB DAO and GreenPill International and other local chapters.\n\n# Hypercert project: Tamagochi at Riverside\n\nProject Website: https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region\n\n[Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n![Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192&w=640&q=75)\n\n# 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling  \nIn rapidly urbanized cities like Taipei, rivers are often overlooked, over-dredged, and stripped of biodiversity. The Huangxi River (Southern Sulfur Creek), once teeming with life, has seen its ecosystem disrupted by aggressive vegetation clearing and human detachment. Shy native species like the White-breasted Waterhen have nearly vanished from view. If we don't act now, we risk losing not only vital habitats but also the community's connection to the very nature flowing beside them.\n\n---\n\n# 📜 Our Solution  \n**Tamagochi at Riverside** brings together environmental education, civic action, and Web3 technology to rewild our imaginations—and our rivers. Partnering with Huangxi Environmental Education Programme (HEEP) and Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO), we designed a playful, powerful campaign where students and citizens alike complete ecological missions, earn interactive NFTs, and re-learn how to live with rivers as neighbors. Through school programs, community workshops, and NFT collectibles, we’re rebuilding bonds between people and place—and helping wildlife thrive again.\n\n---\n\n# 🌱 Our Organisation / Community  \nWe are a collaboration between **HEEP**, a grassroots environmental education initiative, and **FAB DAO**, a Web3 collective focused on public good.

Since 2022, it has hosted almost daily online meetings and weekly dynamics, where participants explore ReFi concepts, develop proof-of-concepts, and connect their challenges and abundances to the creation of collective value. In the long term, ReRe aims to co-create a new cyber layer called **Web3 Regen**. Through these interactions, ReRe has become a space for ongoing collective intelligence and the articulation of regenerative initiatives/projects in Brazil.\n\n🤝 **How it works**: These online meetings are dedicated to co-creation and critical mapping of initiatives and development of value propositions through debates, theoretical and practical exchanges on Web3, Open Source, and ReFi. By relating the challenges and abundances of each person, project, or community, participants learn to apply Web3 concepts in their own contexts. This process has enabled the effective dissemination of regenerative and decentralized foundations, connecting experiences and good practices throughout the Brazilian ecosystem. Within this flow, ReRe also created the first **Shared Resource Commons Pool (PCdRC)**, a P2P dynamic for mutual access to resources — financial, technological, material, social, etc. — guided by equity principles. This mechanism enables resource matching beyond finances to pair participants and make joint projects viable.\n\n## 🔁 Connections\n**AgroforestDAO**: As an active project within the ReRe ecosystem, AgroforestDAO had a latent need for digital integration to launch a Web3 ReFi solution for agroecology. In this context, ReRe provided the collaborative environment for various projects to join forces, resulting in the launch of the **Feijão Amigo** initiative in March 2023, during the first edition of the **Feijoada SAFA** (a side event at Ethereum Rio 23). NFTs representing land plots were created to fund Brazil’s first decentralized agroforestry initiative.\n**Feijão Amigo**: In 2023, the first edition of **ReRe/Feijoada SAFA** brought together key ReFi projects in Brazil — **AgroforestDAO, Ekonavi, Borderless Money, Knot Studios/Tree Tales, FitoEstância, Doces Lembranças, Rio Crypto Hub**, and **Papel Semente**. Through a Shared Resource Commons Pool (PCdRC), the event mobilized 150 participants and launched the **Feijão Amigo NFT**, which initiated Brazil's first decentralized Web3 ReFi agroforestry in partnership with AgroforestDAO.\n**Greenpill Brasil**: In another ReRe meeting in mid-2023, one of the ecosystem co-founders shared the opportunity to establish a Brazilian chapter of the **Greenpill Network**. The idea resonated with several co-creators, who organized a working group and brought the concept to life. From this collaboration, **Greenpill Brasil** was born.\n\n## ✨ Vision\nProjects like **AgroforestDAO** and **Greenpill Brasil**, among many others, have been nurtured through the ReRe ecosystem. These cases inspired the creation of **Glocal Regenerators**, an initiative that systematizes this process of fostering and catalyzing regenerative projects through collective intelligence and collaborative infrastructure. Acting as a “redhat desacelerator,” Glocal Regenerators was initially created to connect directly with **Celo** due to its unique attributes and presence in Brazil, and in the medium term, to build relationships with the private sector, governments, and NGOs to generate real impact across diverse socio-environmental contexts.\n\n## 🌍 Glocal Regenerators: A Living Model\nGlocal Regenerators is the natural evolution of this process — a living ecosystem that is open-source, replicable, and rooted in community wisdom.

With over 6,000 hours of recorded content, it documents workshops, daily meetings, and practical regenerative Web3 experiences. The channel acts as a bridge between global networks and Brazilian communities, democratizing access to Web3 with cultural sensitivity, critical reflection, and practical focus.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Project Justification\nWeb3, as an emerging decentralized technology, has the potential to redefine how people interact, create value, and coordinate resources. However, many enter this ecosystem with industrial-era paradigms — binary thinking, predatory extraction, overproduction, and centralization.\n\n### 🔍 The Problem\n- **Old Paradigms in New Tools**: Web3 used for immediate profit, speculation, high energy consumption, and social exclusion.\n- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Uncritical adoption of dominant narratives without assessing social and ecological impact.\n- **Disconnection from Local Contexts**: Solutions often ignore the cultural, social, and ecological realities of the territories in which they are deployed.\n- **Lack of Consideration for the Planetary Crisis**: Despite crossing 6 of the 9 planetary boundaries by 2023, few projects propose concrete local actions to support planetary health from their territories.\n- **Lack of Climate Resilience**: Many initiatives fail to leverage the potential of open-source networks to develop systemic adaptation and mitigation solutions — such as decentralized clean energy, local food production, plastic recycling, and regenerative biodesign.\n\n## 🌱 The Opportunity\nTo cultivate new mindsets and coordinate local actions that:\n- Stimulate critical thinking and collective intelligence.\n- Promote decentralized and collaborative governance.\n- Connect emerging technologies with ancestral knowledge and glocal ecosystems for local regenerative action.\n- Link local problem-solving needs with the funding and tools of Web3 ReFi.\n\n\n## 🎯 About the Proposal\n- **Culture of Reflection & Critique**: Expand critical onboarding of new people and projects through ReRe’s open daily sessions.\n- **Commons Knowledge**: Publish the ReRe Root Wiki to share and co-create free knowledge across the community.\n- **Open Innovation & Appropriate Technologies**: Foster the creation and “produsage” of FOST through DIWO (Do It With Others) workshops teaching people in urban, rural, and traditional communities to build context-appropriate autonomous solutions.\n- **Open Education**: Produce accessible learning content (\"knowledge pills\") on Web3 ReFi, Gitcoin, Celo, Planetary Health, and Regenerative Systems Design.\n- **Regenerative Systems**: Promote development and deployment of integrated FOST-based solutions like biodigesters, micro wind turbines, plastic recycling, using NFTs with impact, impact DAOs, regeneration-backed tokens, and scientific impact metrics.\n- **Local & Global Integration**: Strengthen connections between territories and global networks such as Celo, Greenpill Network, Regen Coordination, and ReFi DAO.\n---\n## 🌟 We Can Do So Much\n- **Awareness & Engagement**: We create accessible narratives, immersive learning spaces, and cultural translations to welcome diverse communities into ReFi. We are scaling the proven methodology from ReRe to reach more people and projects.\n- **Adoption & Development**: We can prototype tools like cREAL for agroforestry and local economies, develop smart contracts on Celo, and support decentralized governance.\n- **On-Chain Economic Activity**: Through NFTs, DAOs, and blockchain funding, we keep value circulating within regenerative ecosystems.\n- **Regeneration**:\n  🌿 Supporting ecosystems\n  🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Empowering communities\n  💰 Enabling resilient economies\n---\n## 🎯 Expected Impact Over the Year\n- New coordination models based on justice and transparency.\n- Regenerative and intelligent use of resources.\n- Cultural transformation toward an ethical, inclusive, and regenerative Web3.\n\n# References:\n\n- [ReRe Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNf0Lea0=/) \n- [ReRe Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@abundancerere) \n- [Github do ReRe](https://github.com/ReRe-Recursos-Regenerativos)\n- [Wiki - Modular Eco Industry](https://gitlab.com/c_arpino/eco-industria-modular/-/wikis/home)\n- [Biodigestor Boitatá Open Source](https://boitata.eco.br/)\n- [REGOSH](https://regosh.libres.cc/)\n\n\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"g_regenerators"},"recipient":"0x352B65354FCA7553fd3041AcB6934f84248370Fb"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiabkhgsqkxr5gmmgykbzjvi45jhlazzxtkxqpsbh54cxjwbh4ejlu","projects":[{"name":"Glocal Regenerators","id":"0x02c07319d3f50da864b24f2e9f9b01dd0fee702ec620a6da8b161d16d3b81058","metadata":{"title":"Glocal Regenerators","logoImg":"bafkreihug3v5qat32en5hvvth5bnkstzwwztysdfqrhij7bptubtdtigvu","website":"https://linktr.ee/glocal_regenerators","bannerImg":"bafkreidpzsdnksudnccskdp4bsqirirhx7q5qjaru3c2ft4hxcdv6tuzra","createdAt":1743976219643,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-04-07T02:04:54.142Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0x0fa8cf7e952493cc0ffd7070c36504cb2e741d7592dc5567fd7453a78c91c79e2080f7bafa362019a5a8060ba15bd8a90c86197bf769b8645d26fa32bee8de011c","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-04-07T02:04:54.142Z","expirationDate":"2025-07-06T02:04:54.142Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x5F56E995e8D3bd05a70a63f0d7531437e873772e","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#g_regenerators","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:FpQxNUzoVxYhTOucnuRqXSE6VReUWQPU1vPRaX39+IM="]}}},"description":"# 🌱 Glocal Regenerators\n**Ethical Onboarding to Web3ReFi**\n**Bridging regenerative communities with decentralized technologies.**\n\n## 🌱 Context\n**ReRe (Regenerative Resources)** is a pioneering protocol driving the cultural transition of Web3 toward regeneration.

However, many enter this ecosystem with industrial-era paradigms — binary thinking, predatory extraction, overproduction, and centralization.\n\n### 🔍 The Problem\n- **Old Paradigms in New Tools**: Web3 used for immediate profit, speculation, high energy consumption, and social exclusion.\n- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Uncritical adoption of dominant narratives without assessing social and ecological impact.\n- **Disconnection from Local Contexts**: Solutions often ignore the cultural, social, and ecological realities of the territories in which they are deployed.\n- **Lack of Consideration for the Planetary Crisis**: Despite crossing 6 of the 9 planetary boundaries by 2023, few projects propose concrete local actions to support planetary health from their territories.\n- **Lack of Climate Resilience**: Many initiatives fail to leverage the potential of open-source networks to develop systemic adaptation and mitigation solutions — such as decentralized clean energy, local food production, plastic recycling, and regenerative biodesign.\n\n## 🌱 The Opportunity\nTo cultivate new mindsets and coordinate local actions that:\n- Stimulate critical thinking and collective intelligence.\n- Promote decentralized and collaborative governance.\n- Connect emerging technologies with ancestral knowledge and glocal ecosystems for local regenerative action.\n- Link local problem-solving needs with the funding and tools of Web3 ReFi.\n\n\n## 🎯 About the Proposal\n- **Culture of Reflection & Critique**: Expand critical onboarding of new people and projects through ReRe’s open daily sessions.\n- **Commons Knowledge**: Publish the ReRe Root Wiki to share and co-create free knowledge across the community.\n- **Open Innovation & Appropriate Technologies**: Foster the creation and “produsage” of FOST through DIWO (Do It With Others) workshops teaching people in urban, rural, and traditional communities to build context-appropriate autonomous solutions.\n- **Open Education**: Produce accessible learning content (\"knowledge pills\") on Web3 ReFi, Gitcoin, Celo, Planetary Health, and Regenerative Systems Design.\n- **Regenerative Systems**: Promote development and deployment of integrated FOST-based solutions like biodigesters, micro wind turbines, plastic recycling, using NFTs with impact, impact DAOs, regeneration-backed tokens, and scientific impact metrics.\n- **Local & Global Integration**: Strengthen connections between territories and global networks such as Celo, Greenpill Network, Regen Coordination, and ReFi DAO.\n---\n## 🌟 We Can Do So Much\n- **Awareness & Engagement**: We create accessible narratives, immersive learning spaces, and cultural translations to welcome diverse communities into ReFi. We are scaling the proven methodology from ReRe to reach more people and projects.\n- **Adoption & Development**: We can prototype tools like cREAL for agroforestry and local economies, develop smart contracts on Celo, and support decentralized governance.\n- **On-Chain Economic Activity**: Through NFTs, DAOs, and blockchain funding, we keep value circulating within regenerative ecosystems.\n- **Regeneration**:\n  🌿 Supporting ecosystems\n  🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Empowering communities\n  💰 Enabling resilient economies\n---\n## 🎯 Expected Impact Over the Year\n- New coordination models based on justice and transparency.\n- Regenerative and intelligent use of resources.\n- Cultural transformation toward an ethical, inclusive, and regenerative Web3.\n\n# References:\n\n- [ReRe Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNf0Lea0=/) \n- [ReRe Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@abundancerere) \n- [Github do ReRe](https://github.com/ReRe-Recursos-Regenerativos)\n- [Wiki -

By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for climate and socio-economic upheaval. Our infrastructure for waste regeneration enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. \n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nWe are also building governance frameworks for marginalized communities that will also be used in preserving these resources transparently as well as enable them to receive alternative means to financing.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3 through alternative financing: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants and receive impact certificates. We are also not only focused on environmental upheaval, but also financial and economic success for marginalized communities such as savings and lendings groups and Chamas.\n\n[![IMAGE-2024-08-02-16-07-51.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/59r1sMZL/IMAGE-2024-08-02-16-07-51.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bd1Kv4Yw)\n\n-  Create a Regeneration hub for ReFi Tanzania - Create a safe space where regenerative projects can receive mentorship, support and guidance to provide real world solutions that impact our climate and socio-economics. We have also been piloting with community currencies in Tanzania successfully working hand in hand with the local government and University of Dar es salaam. In the long-run we are looking to introduce our own Mini-round.\n- Community Engagement: Raise awareness about waste-related issues and involve local communities in waste management and regeneration efforts as well as how they can benefit from sustainable practices in the form of ecological credits, tokenizing of Real world Assets and much more.\n\n\nProject Updates & Learnings\n- We have successfully facilitated not only the removal, but conversion of 1 Tonne of LDPE & HDPE waste into eco-pellets so far from landfills in Dar es salaam.\n\n![womenrecycling](https://bafybeigdmhwuy7bhfxmqz7q6nuyvmlezxbz4lnptjlf6s2elsvpdg3srba.ipfs.w3s.link/women%20ldpe.jpg)\n\n\n- We successfully set had our annual ReFi event last November, as well as have kept up our monthly beach cleanups organizing our community including local stakeholders, government officials and sustainability enthusiasts.

By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for climate and socio-economic upheaval. Our infrastructure for waste regeneration enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. \n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nWe are also building governance frameworks for marginalized communities that will also be used in preserving these resources transparently as well as enable them to receive alternative means to financing.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3 through alternative financing: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants and receive impact certificates. We are also not only focused on environmental upheaval, but also financial and economic success for marginalized communities such as savings and lendings groups and Chamas.\n\n[![IMAGE-2024-08-02-16-07-51.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/59r1sMZL/IMAGE-2024-08-02-16-07-51.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bd1Kv4Yw)\n\n-  Create a Regeneration hub for ReFi Tanzania - Create a safe space where regenerative projects can receive mentorship, support and guidance to provide real world solutions that impact our climate and socio-economics. We have also been piloting with community currencies in Tanzania successfully working hand in hand with the local government and University of Dar es salaam. In the long-run we are looking to introduce our own Mini-round.\n- Community Engagement: Raise awareness about waste-related issues and involve local communities in waste management and regeneration efforts as well as how they can benefit from sustainable practices in the form of ecological credits, tokenizing of Real world Assets and much more.\n\n\nProject Updates & Learnings\n- We have successfully facilitated not only the removal, but conversion of 1 Tonne of LDPE & HDPE waste into eco-pellets so far from landfills in Dar es salaam.\n\n![womenrecycling](https://bafybeigdmhwuy7bhfxmqz7q6nuyvmlezxbz4lnptjlf6s2elsvpdg3srba.ipfs.w3s.link/women%20ldpe.jpg)\n\n\n- We successfully set had our annual ReFi event last November, as well as have kept up our monthly beach cleanups organizing our community including local stakeholders, government officials and sustainability enthusiasts.

A Photosynthetic Fintech for the new Millennium\n\n# Verifying Regeneration, Democratizing Carbon Offsets\n\nThe GG23 Regen Coordination Global Round is about backing impact-driven ReFi networks that make a real difference—and that's exactly what *CODEX* does.\n\n*CODEX* is a next-generation certification mark for carbon stewardship, leveraging Web3 verification to ensure what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) offsets. Unlike traditional carbon markets, which rely on opaque credits, *CODEX* empowers individuals and communities to take direct action in regenerative efforts—verifying, tracking, and rewarding their contributions transparently on-chain.\n\n# 🌍 Equity & Democratization in Carbon Offsets\nThe carbon market has long been controlled by centralized players, making it inaccessible to individuals and small-scale regenerative projects. *CODEX* flips the script by enabling direct participation in carbon-negative asset generation, ensuring that those doing the work—small land stewards, Indigenous communities, and grassroots organizations—receive equitable rewards for their impact.\n\n✅ *Democratizing access to carbon markets through open-source, on-chain verification*\n✅ *Shifting financial benefits to local stewards rather than corporate intermediaries*\n✅ *Reducing barriers for individuals and small projects to monetize their climate-positive actions*\n\nBy creating a distributed and verifiable ledger of real-world carbon sequestration, *CODEX* ensures that climate-positive efforts are fairly recognized and rewarded.\n\n# 🌱Key Active Goals & Milestones\n🔹 *Q2 2025 – *CODEX* QR Deployment Begins*\n\n* Launch of *CODEX* hardware/software woodburned QR codes for on-chain verification of tree stewardship with https://cascadialabs.app\n* Integration with existing and new community-based reforestation projects via https://carbonaut.app\n\n🔹 *Q3 2025 – Scaling Tree Planting & Verification*\n\n* First 10,000 trees tagged and verified with *CODEX*\n* Expansion to new partner organizations and local regenerative communities\n\n🔹 *Q4 2025 – Market Adoption & ReFi Integration*\n\n* Full integration with major ReFi ecosystems, including Regen.network\n* Expansion of *CODEX*-backed financial incentives for verified tree stewards\n\n🔹 *2026 – Global Scaling & Standardization*\n\n* 100,000+ trees verified using *CODEX* QR\n* *CODEX* positioned as the leading certification standard for verifiable nature-based carbon sequestration\n\n# 🌿 Why Support CODEX\n✅ *Decentralized accountability for carbon stewardship*\n✅ *Equitable participation in carbon-negative asset creation*\n✅ Verifiable, transparent offset generation—no greenwashing\n✅ *Empowering local communities to create real-world impact*\n✅ *Aligns with GG23’s mission of funding ReFi solutions that scale regenerative finance*\n\nBy funding *CODEX*, GG23 can help scale a truly regenerative and community-driven climate solution—one that doesn’t just promise change but proves it on-chain while ensuring equitable access to carbon markets.\n\n 🌿 **Ready to back the future of ReFi verification?

🌍 Bloom is a place-based social network with a peer incubator for community initiatives.\n🔗 [bloomnetwork.earth](https://bloomnetwork.earth)\n\n💡 Your $1 donation can unlock $100+ in matching funds! Every dollar supports grassroots projects restoring ecosystems, regenerating economies, and empowering local leaders.\n\n# Real-World Impact 🌱\n\nSince 2008, Bloom has grown into a **global movement**, engaging **30,000+ people across 32 hubs in 13 countries**. We've helped:\n✅ **7,000+ urban and agroecology farms** take root\n✅ **1,000+ community enterprises launch**, from co-ops to small businesses\n✅ **400+ watershed restoration projects** protect ecosystems\n✅ **4 thriving bioregional economies** grow\n\nIn the past six months alone, Bloomers have created **230 new wallets** and completed **290 verified bounties** for real-world community action. \n\n\n***\n\n# 🌻 How Your Contribution Helps\n\nBloom connects local climate action with a unique, community-oriented implementation of Web3 bounties, to scale impact and fund grassroots solutions. Your support helps:\n\n* **Onboard first-time users to Web3**\n* **Power local media feeds** – making it easy to discover & participate in community projects while making friends\n* Bloomers **share impact stories** via [**incentivized, image-rich impact reporting**](https://bloomnetwork.earth/member/localactionrewards), inspiring action & peer learning \n* **Equip grassroots leaders** with mentorship, guidance & operational support\n* **Grow local treasuries**, financing grassroots development\n\n📖  [Read the impact reports here](https://bloomnetwork.earth/communityposts)!  Bloom impact reports automatically post to Karma GAP, reducing the reporting burden for busy local leaders.\n\n***\n\n# 🌟 Local Action Rewards – Quarterly Grant Pool\n\n**Our approach incentivizes Bloomers to share their impact work, learn from one another, and build healthy bioregional economies.** \n\nSince Summer 2024, **we've distributed $12,000 per quarter, with a goal of scaling 1,000x**. This funding supports local revenue streams in agroforestry, soil regeneration, and community care while ensuring “invisible labor” is seen and compensated. This labor is critical to community-building and economic transformation, yet rarely funded in the dominant economy. \n\n***\n\n# 💰 2025 Milestones\n\n80% of contributions to this Gitcoin grant go to the Local Action Rewards pool!

Every dollar supports grassroots projects restoring ecosystems, regenerating economies, and empowering local leaders.\n\n# Real-World Impact 🌱\n\nSince 2008, Bloom has grown into a **global movement**, engaging **30,000+ people across 32 hubs in 13 countries**. We've helped:\n✅ **7,000+ urban and agroecology farms** take root\n✅ **1,000+ community enterprises launch**, from co-ops to small businesses\n✅ **400+ watershed restoration projects** protect ecosystems\n✅ **4 thriving bioregional economies** grow\n\nIn the past six months alone, Bloomers have created **230 new wallets** and completed **290 verified bounties** for real-world community action. \n\n\n***\n\n# 🌻 How Your Contribution Helps\n\nBloom connects local climate action with a unique, community-oriented implementation of Web3 bounties, to scale impact and fund grassroots solutions. Your support helps:\n\n* **Onboard first-time users to Web3**\n* **Power local media feeds** – making it easy to discover & participate in community projects while making friends\n* Bloomers **share impact stories** via [**incentivized, image-rich impact reporting**](https://bloomnetwork.earth/member/localactionrewards), inspiring action & peer learning \n* **Equip grassroots leaders** with mentorship, guidance & operational support\n* **Grow local treasuries**, financing grassroots development\n\n📖  [Read the impact reports here](https://bloomnetwork.earth/communityposts)!  Bloom impact reports automatically post to Karma GAP, reducing the reporting burden for busy local leaders.\n\n***\n\n# 🌟 Local Action Rewards – Quarterly Grant Pool\n\n**Our approach incentivizes Bloomers to share their impact work, learn from one another, and build healthy bioregional economies.** \n\nSince Summer 2024, **we've distributed $12,000 per quarter, with a goal of scaling 1,000x**. This funding supports local revenue streams in agroforestry, soil regeneration, and community care while ensuring “invisible labor” is seen and compensated. This labor is critical to community-building and economic transformation, yet rarely funded in the dominant economy. \n\n***\n\n# 💰 2025 Milestones\n\n80% of contributions to this Gitcoin grant go to the Local Action Rewards pool!

community and the Brooklyn Marine Terminal site, 122 acres of waterfront land that the NYC Economic Development Corporation is attempting to deliver to luxury real estate developers. https://edc.nyc/project/brooklyn-marine-terminal \nThrough research, education, flyering, organizing, meetings, webinars, information sessions, workshops, town halls, film screenings, protests and more, we have taken the initiative and activated our community to resist development of unnecessary luxury housing units on Brooklyn’s last working waterfront - Red Hook. \nWe do not oppose development, but we do object to irresponsible and disrespectful design decisions such as building housing towers in a flood zone and further marginalizing existing communities which have been neglected and sidelined by NYC for decades, dating back to the time of Robert Moses and beyond.  \nWe have amplified underrepresented groups, united voices of nonprofits, activists, business owners, city council members and community members, and rewoven the fabric of neighborhoods which have experienced challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of transportation, gentrification, and flooding. We have coalesced as a united group and developed the Voices of the Waterfront website to share activities and updates, directly countering NYC EDC’s efforts to leave people out of this extremely important process which will influence New Yorkers for generations to come. voicesofthewaterfront.com\nWe have spoken and we have listened - to each other. We believe that the Red Hook community knows what is best for us. We support a modern working waterfront that will benefit not only Red Hook but the entire borough of Brooklyn and all of New York City. \nOur activities in recent months can be viewed on our Karma GAP project here: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-red-hook?tab=updates\nWe have collaborated as a community to develop 7 foundational principles for the Brooklyn Marine Terminal development. These principles are currently under review from the group and we will share updates as they are finalized. In brief: \n1. We want a resilient, thriving green port that serves our community and the region well, now and into the future.\n2. We want this port to operate as a public good, financed using similar models to those that sustain other vital public assets.\n3. We want investment that prioritizes neighborhood infrastructure and NYCHA before accommodating new market rate tenants.\n4. We want equity, revenue and profits to stay local through jobs, small business and other programs.\n5. We want a plan that integrates well with existing local and regional plans.\n6. We want all applicable state, federal, and local laws, frameworks, and codes to be followed.\n7. We want true community participation to be honored in the planning process, and we want our planning efforts to be supported by local and regional experts.\nOur primary goal for Q2 2025 is to resist the NYC Economic Development Corporation's inadequate proposed plan to develop the Brooklyn Marine Terminal (BMT) site in Red Hook. We are galvanizing the community and advocating to the BMT Task Force toward this end. \nOnce we shut down the currently proposed EDC plan and receive more time for the planning process, we will continue to organize and collaborate as a community to develop a comprehensive beneficial BMT plan which adheres to and honors the 7 principles listed above. \nIn addition to these primary goals, in 2025 we plan to engage in the following: \n- host 3 web3 onboarding workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host 2 regenerative finance workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host regular (weekly or biweekly) community cleanups around the waterfront in Red Hook \n- explore decentralized governance possibilities and share them with Red Hook community (such as creation of a DAO) \n- host monthly water workshops led in collaboration with water artist and activist Betsy Damon \n- unite local water organizations such as Resilient Red Hook, PortSide NY and RETI Center through events and shared technology  \n- support Resilient Red Hook's initiatives (https://www.resilient-red-hook.com/) especially participation in the Rise to Resilience coalition (https://rise2resilience.org/)\nIt has been a great joy and honor to participate in grassroots organizing, to experience the tenacity of community, and to uphold the legacy of Red Hook as a historical maritime powerhouse, a haven for artists and creatives, a melting pot of diversity, and a neighborhood on the waterfront. \nThank you for your time, attention, and participation in the story of Red Hook, Brooklyn. We are very grateful.

Italia is a network-driven initiative dedicated to tackle ecological and social challenges through innovative technology and grassroots initiatives. Over the past few years, we've focused on building the foundational infrastructure for regenerative development across Italian bioregions. Our vision for 2025 and beyond is to amplify our achievements through focused education, strategic network expansion, and tangible ecological restoration projects, creating a blueprint for similar Mediterranean regions.  \n  \n# Focus areas  \n  \n## Education and Outreach  \n  \nWe work to raise awareness about regenerative practices, blockchain technology, and community-led development. By educating diverse audiences, we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities shaping Italy’s ecosystems.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_\n- Hosted two online workshops on mutual credit protocols, featuring [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) and [Cycles.money](https://x.com/cyclesmoney).  \n- Led an in-person training session on commitment pooling during [Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) Week.  \n- Participated in key Italian web3 events, including [ETHNA](https://x.com/ethna_rocks), [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome), [Digitalia Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsXeGs-cJs&ab_channel=UrbeETH), and [Apical Days Palermo](https://www.instagram.com/apical_org/p/DBi5QpLsUyd/).  \n  \n## Community Empowerment  \n  \nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration. We facilitate collaboration, leadership, and decision-making among existing networks, fostering self-sufficiency and resilience. Through community-led initiatives, we build social capital and empower collective action.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_  \n- In partnership with Rifai Sicilia and Grassroots Economics, we launched a mutual credit [pilot project](https://sarafu.network/pools/0xb792Ea4BBd378a03463a05A8A91bbBfD0Acd5687), exploring alternative economic models to support local resilience and community-driven economic development.  \n  \n## Ecological Development  \n  \nWe promote ecosystems restoration, biodiversity protection, and sustainable land-use practices by providing resources, knowledge and capital to local regenerative projects that create impact on-the-ground.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_ \nIn 2024, we sponsored a [Permaculture Design Course](https://www.instagram.com/associazioneboscoangimbe/p/DFcpyptu3dC/) at Bosco Angimbè (Trapani), training 22 participants in advanced ecological practices. The program directly contributed to ecosystem restoration with 60 supporting plant species introduced and 30 tree planted by participants of the course in collaboration with local ecological experts to ensure the preservation of native ecosystem characteristics.  \n  \n# 2025 Strategic Objectives  \n  \n## Expanding Education & Capacity Building  \n  \nIn 2025, we’ll enhance both digital and in-person educational resources, develop specialized training programs for different community sectors, and create accessible content on regenerative practices to broaden our impact.  \n  \n## Strengthening the Network  \n  \nWe aim to deepen connections with the global ReFi/Web3 ecosystem and Italian ReFi nodes, support grassroots initiatives across multiple regions, and build leadership programs that empower communities to drive regenerative change.","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"ReFi_Italia"},"recipient":"0xa520D9dE41cAD5d553Ec35805B4DF2F2d01691A4"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiarnj3uu7bgjizz6n76fzrzxvb366u233v2qiatapz5rjjpavwpgu","projects":[{"name":"ReFi Italia","id":"0x00d0a7de37e0380691919dcfdff351f1ffe484e2cef44413212a8b4278c55dfc","metadata":{"title":"ReFi Italia","logoImg":"bafkreidcj5tz6zmx2yvdr2maq7cejp57h3hzfjzhbo3z32sohvchrouzkq","website":"https://linktr.ee/refi_italia","bannerImg":"bafkreibhebagd6r7z3syhdlnuav36k422cxkd7ig4s3qq7tze56eu6u6ja","createdAt":1722891312393,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..dMUj9EopxqMpGHRWV4x8ury1tgawuIe2UllN78_rdKKv7KuntpIeORFtiLUT6D3zmVDK8W2CRx0WqeA1bI0ACw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-05T20:49:21.050Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-05T20:49:21.050Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-03T20:49:21.050Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xa520D9dE41cAD5d553Ec35805B4DF2F2d01691A4","hash":"v0.0.0:ggR0MXfzOqAWw3jPIAn8/FsUJID8/3rubWXyBr/6S8o=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#ReFi_Italia"}}},"description":"ReFi Italia is a network-driven initiative dedicated to tackle ecological and social challenges through innovative technology and grassroots initiatives.

By educating diverse audiences, we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities shaping Italy’s ecosystems.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_\n- Hosted two online workshops on mutual credit protocols, featuring [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) and [Cycles.money](https://x.com/cyclesmoney).  \n- Led an in-person training session on commitment pooling during [Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) Week.  \n- Participated in key Italian web3 events, including [ETHNA](https://x.com/ethna_rocks), [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome), [Digitalia Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsXeGs-cJs&ab_channel=UrbeETH), and [Apical Days Palermo](https://www.instagram.com/apical_org/p/DBi5QpLsUyd/).  \n  \n## Community Empowerment  \n  \nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration. We facilitate collaboration, leadership, and decision-making among existing networks, fostering self-sufficiency and resilience. Through community-led initiatives, we build social capital and empower collective action.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_  \n- In partnership with Rifai Sicilia and Grassroots Economics, we launched a mutual credit [pilot project](https://sarafu.network/pools/0xb792Ea4BBd378a03463a05A8A91bbBfD0Acd5687), exploring alternative economic models to support local resilience and community-driven economic development.  \n  \n## Ecological Development  \n  \nWe promote ecosystems restoration, biodiversity protection, and sustainable land-use practices by providing resources, knowledge and capital to local regenerative projects that create impact on-the-ground.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_ \nIn 2024, we sponsored a [Permaculture Design Course](https://www.instagram.com/associazioneboscoangimbe/p/DFcpyptu3dC/) at Bosco Angimbè (Trapani), training 22 participants in advanced ecological practices. The program directly contributed to ecosystem restoration with 60 supporting plant species introduced and 30 tree planted by participants of the course in collaboration with local ecological experts to ensure the preservation of native ecosystem characteristics.  \n  \n# 2025 Strategic Objectives  \n  \n## Expanding Education & Capacity Building  \n  \nIn 2025, we’ll enhance both digital and in-person educational resources, develop specialized training programs for different community sectors, and create accessible content on regenerative practices to broaden our impact.  \n  \n## Strengthening the Network  \n  \nWe aim to deepen connections with the global ReFi/Web3 ecosystem and Italian ReFi nodes, support grassroots initiatives across multiple regions, and build leadership programs that empower communities to drive regenerative

We’ve catalyzed a growing movement around regenerative finance (ReFi) and community-based coordination. Now, we enter a new phase.\n\nIn 2025, our core focus is **consolidating the infrastructure for decentralized coordination**. This proposal is part of a broader, interconnected effort to strengthen the systems that will sustain and scale regenerative action.\n\n### Cookie Jar Coordination Layer on Celo\n\n[![Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vHC52kwW/Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png)](https://postimg.cc/4mbKm8dd)\n\nWe are co-developing a coordination mechanism using [Cookie Jar](https://github.com/HoomanDigital/cookie-jar/blob/main/contract/cookie%20jar-withblacklist.sol) contracts [deployed on the Celo blockchain](https://celo-alfajores.blockscout.com/address/0xD54799973e5e8f468A6DF910C53514aeDF9D4868?tab=logs). This is work is part of a collaborative [research model proposal within the **Allo Capital** community](https://research.allo.capital/t/decentralized-research-funding-using-cookie-jar/122), and a collaboration between the **Greenpill Dev Guild** and **Celo Europe**. It aims to bring **transparent micro-granting infrastructure** to our community, using ERC-20 compatible tokens like cREAL.\n\nWe’re currently exploring and implementing two Cookie Jars:\n- One for the **GreenPill Brasil Council** (our main governance body).\n- One for the **Guardians** (our distributed community stewards).\n\nThese Jars will serve as onchain grant pools that reward verified regenerative contributions, reinforce autonomy in coordination, and support distributed decision-making.\n\n### Climate Megazord Coordination via Gardens\n\nIn parallel, we are consolidating our [Climate Megazord](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGYTqqLdlA/5iEk5mpI4k1jAkVh2NhxsA/view?utm_content=DAGYTqqLdlA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h6f2da95b9b) as our long-term climate resilience protocol. It follows three pillars:\n- **Prediction** (early signals and local climate data).\n- **Adaptation** (community infrastructure and preparedness).\n- **Response** (coordinated action during disasters).\n\nGovernance and resource allocation for this protocol is coordinated via [Gardens v2](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/137/0x6fac69b92b1943da2a8ff99e3687451f10066018/0x65bf57a410ed5fa69669f307c2da65eae06279f4), using signaling and conviction voting mechanisms.\n\n### Glocalism Collaboration\n\nOur alliances span from local agroecology task forces (e.g. SAF do Futuro, Morro da Redenção) to the global Ethereum Localism movement and ecosystem allies like Celo and Gitcoin. GreenPill Brasil is committed to being a bridge between grassroots regeneration and resilient coordination tech.\n---\n## How the Funds Will Be Used\n\nThis new phase is about **laying the groundwork for long-term regeneration** by creating the digital infrastructure that empowers communities, codifies trust, and fuels decentralized action.\n\nThe requested funds for this cycle will be focused on:\n- **Deploying and operationalizing two Cookie Jars** for internal micro-funding coordination (Council & Guardians).\n- **Coordinating and documenting the Climate Megazord infrastructure**, including governance cycles on Gardens.\n- **Sustaining direct funding for grassroots regen activities** via [Charmverse proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpillbrasil/proposals) under our Regen Incentives campaign.\n- **Scale our onboarding and funding processes** to support more projects and regional nodes.\n- **Refine our decentralized protocols**, integrating tools like [Impact Miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=pt_BR&pli=1), and the evolving [GreenGoods app](https://greengoods.app) (with new in-app plant ID features).\n- **Expand partnerships** with AgroforestDAO, Fabulosa Lab, Celo Public Goods, Celo Europe, and others to co-create more inclusive and impactful regenerative ecosystems.\n---\n## **Join Us in Building a Future**\n\nGreenPill Brasil is not just a project—it’s a movement. Your support will help us build a infrastructure that scales trust, amplifies grassroots agency, and coordinates regenerative action across Brazil and beyond.\n\n[telegram](https://t.me/+6GlufLobfMRiMTIx)\n\n**Let’s regenerate, one step at a time.** \n\n[![Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/90LYfY0C/Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/kRtb18Wp)\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"greenpillbr","projectTwitter":"greenpillbrasil"},"recipient":"0x6cA0493b04b025D4430032d7645130E5C3268E0C"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreibtefn5osg2ic5z2eae4pa5h2qv2wl7xg7bnt7uqgyko66jtqfrgi","projects":[{"name":"GreenPill Brasil -

We’ve catalyzed a growing movement around regenerative finance (ReFi) and community-based coordination. Now, we enter a new phase.\n\nIn 2025, our core focus is **consolidating the infrastructure for decentralized coordination**. This proposal is part of a broader, interconnected effort to strengthen the systems that will sustain and scale regenerative action.\n\n### Cookie Jar Coordination Layer on Celo\n\n[![Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vHC52kwW/Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png)](https://postimg.cc/4mbKm8dd)\n\nWe are co-developing a coordination mechanism using [Cookie Jar](https://github.com/HoomanDigital/cookie-jar/blob/main/contract/cookie%20jar-withblacklist.sol) contracts [deployed on the Celo blockchain](https://celo-alfajores.blockscout.com/address/0xD54799973e5e8f468A6DF910C53514aeDF9D4868?tab=logs). This is work is part of a collaborative [research model proposal within the **Allo Capital** community](https://research.allo.capital/t/decentralized-research-funding-using-cookie-jar/122), and a collaboration between the **Greenpill Dev Guild** and **Celo Europe**. It aims to bring **transparent micro-granting infrastructure** to our community, using ERC-20 compatible tokens like cREAL.\n\nWe’re currently exploring and implementing two Cookie Jars:\n- One for the **GreenPill Brasil Council** (our main governance body).\n- One for the **Guardians** (our distributed community stewards).\n\nThese Jars will serve as onchain grant pools that reward verified regenerative contributions, reinforce autonomy in coordination, and support distributed decision-making.\n\n### Climate Megazord Coordination via Gardens\n\nIn parallel, we are consolidating our [Climate Megazord](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGYTqqLdlA/5iEk5mpI4k1jAkVh2NhxsA/view?utm_content=DAGYTqqLdlA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h6f2da95b9b) as our long-term climate resilience protocol. It follows three pillars:\n- **Prediction** (early signals and local climate data).\n- **Adaptation** (community infrastructure and preparedness).\n- **Response** (coordinated action during disasters).\n\nGovernance and resource allocation for this protocol is coordinated via [Gardens v2](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/137/0x6fac69b92b1943da2a8ff99e3687451f10066018/0x65bf57a410ed5fa69669f307c2da65eae06279f4), using signaling and conviction voting mechanisms.\n\n### Glocalism Collaboration\n\nOur alliances span from local agroecology task forces (e.g. SAF do Futuro, Morro da Redenção) to the global Ethereum Localism movement and ecosystem allies like Celo and Gitcoin. GreenPill Brasil is committed to being a bridge between grassroots regeneration and resilient coordination tech.\n---\n## How the Funds Will Be Used\n\nThis new phase is about **laying the groundwork for long-term regeneration** by creating the digital infrastructure that empowers communities, codifies trust, and fuels decentralized action.\n\nThe requested funds for this cycle will be focused on:\n- **Deploying and operationalizing two Cookie Jars** for internal micro-funding coordination (Council & Guardians).\n- **Coordinating and documenting the Climate Megazord infrastructure**, including governance cycles on Gardens.\n- **Sustaining direct funding for grassroots regen activities** via [Charmverse proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpillbrasil/proposals) under our Regen Incentives campaign.\n- **Scale our onboarding and funding processes** to support more projects and regional nodes.\n- **Refine our decentralized protocols**, integrating tools like [Impact Miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=pt_BR&pli=1), and the evolving [GreenGoods app](https://greengoods.app) (with new in-app plant ID features).\n- **Expand partnerships** with AgroforestDAO, Fabulosa Lab, Celo Public Goods, Celo Europe, and others to co-create more inclusive and impactful regenerative ecosystems.\n---\n## **Join Us in Building a Future**\n\nGreenPill Brasil is not just a project—it’s a movement. Your support will help us build a infrastructure that scales trust, amplifies grassroots agency, and coordinates regenerative action across Brazil and

are building a web3 community with the purpose of supporting agroforestry stewards. People that value having ways to enhance their involvment with intergenerational Agroforest Systems (SAFs) 🐜\n\n# Onboarding Food Forest Stewards 🐜🐜🐜\n\nDuring Q1 2025 we've been campaigning and hosting our second [learning journey]. The [Jornada AgroforestDAO 2](https://x.com/agroforestDAO/status/1900009504625787367) (JA2) cohort for Brazilian stewards, had over 75 applications and started in March 5th. The journeys are inspired by the [Kernel Fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/), we host six weekly introductory sessions of 1-2 hs followed by onchain tasks, and have attendance certified by [POAPs](https://collectors.poap.xyz/token/7325294)\n\n[![colagem-JA2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Twy1Hdch/colagem-JA2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/ygH7Dztz)\n\nApprentices learn about autocustody and onchain reputation, and are allowed to create profiles in our [Charmverse](https://hackmd.io/CcrZJ0_oSsOhP9ebMwXmLg?stext=612%3A10%3A0%3A1742587239%3AkV8u_2&both=) workspace both for them and their systems. \n\n[![charmverse3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Qtfbb1rG/charmverse3.png)](https://postimg.cc/qhCyBtRj)\n\nOn Charmverse and [Telegram](https://t.me/+TNwrhRCyCxQ4Zjcx) we experiment with collective learning and governance. We are now 43 SAFs from JA1 + JA2 in the workspace and over 100 stewards in the brazilian Telegram 🐝🐝\n\nThey are invited to participate in mutual support rounds both as a donor and grantee. In order to participate in our rounds the steward has to set seasonal milestones and updates on our [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/agroforestdao). \n\n[![karmagap.png](https://i.postimg.cc/V67w8HjJ/karmagap.png)](https://postimg.cc/YGmZNRD7)\n\nIn the end of the journey we created a [collective Safe account](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0xb8e17b1E7b6d1fcAa8a258b8AB7fF3c333D167f3) with the apprentices, and they start experimenting with governing common resources, allocation mechanisms and voting. \n\nStewards that mantain their workspace updated for an entire sun cycle will receive a [Hypercert](https://app.hypercerts.org/hypercerts/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-19396094914493492417412352623610788052992) attesting their contribution to the DAO \n\nWe believe that by investing Gitcoin funds in education and capacity building among stewards we will be able to generate a fertile ground for cosmo-local partnerships, which can in turn feed back to support more education. \n\n# Volunteering Network 💪\n\n[![sarafu.png](https://i.postimg.cc/6380MT68/sarafu.png)](https://postimg.cc/k6dK4JbC)\n\nThe JA1 apprentices stressed the importance of supporting stewards that are Hosts in web2 networks of travellers and volunteers. We then decided to experiment with a common pool where Hosts can withdraw usd after delivering a volunteering report [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network/pools/0x0788459989F726Fd110897a20Faa990D6ef57E6A)\n\n[![unlockprotocol.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g0XtJtFw/unlockprotocol.png)](https://postimg.cc/B83B7gvs)\n\nVolunteers are invited to join AgroforestDAO and are recognized by receiving an email with Unlock Protocol's certificates (keys) issued in a shared account (lock) of Hosts. They are invited to follow and join AgroforestDAO Journeys. \n\n# Overall Experience 🐜\n\nOnboarding people from different regions of Brazil has been an incredible experience for the past 8 months. So much diversity and stories, so many possibilities for collaboration, all grounded in seasonality.\n\n[![imagemro-aconectada.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FRPMqWSD/imagemro-aconectada.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bDtVSR3t)\n\nMany local agentes are starting to experience the benefits of being part of a global tribe and realize that they are not alone anymore.

People that value having ways to enhance their involvment with intergenerational Agroforest Systems (SAFs) 🐜\n\n# Onboarding Food Forest Stewards 🐜🐜🐜\n\nDuring Q1 2025 we've been campaigning and hosting our second [learning journey]. The [Jornada AgroforestDAO 2](https://x.com/agroforestDAO/status/1900009504625787367) (JA2) cohort for Brazilian stewards, had over 75 applications and started in March 5th. The journeys are inspired by the [Kernel Fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/), we host six weekly introductory sessions of 1-2 hs followed by onchain tasks, and have attendance certified by [POAPs](https://collectors.poap.xyz/token/7325294)\n\n[![colagem-JA2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Twy1Hdch/colagem-JA2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/ygH7Dztz)\n\nApprentices learn about autocustody and onchain reputation, and are allowed to create profiles in our [Charmverse](https://hackmd.io/CcrZJ0_oSsOhP9ebMwXmLg?stext=612%3A10%3A0%3A1742587239%3AkV8u_2&both=) workspace both for them and their systems. \n\n[![charmverse3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Qtfbb1rG/charmverse3.png)](https://postimg.cc/qhCyBtRj)\n\nOn Charmverse and [Telegram](https://t.me/+TNwrhRCyCxQ4Zjcx) we experiment with collective learning and governance. We are now 43 SAFs from JA1 + JA2 in the workspace and over 100 stewards in the brazilian Telegram 🐝🐝\n\nThey are invited to participate in mutual support rounds both as a donor and grantee. In order to participate in our rounds the steward has to set seasonal milestones and updates on our [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/agroforestdao). \n\n[![karmagap.png](https://i.postimg.cc/V67w8HjJ/karmagap.png)](https://postimg.cc/YGmZNRD7)\n\nIn the end of the journey we created a [collective Safe account](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0xb8e17b1E7b6d1fcAa8a258b8AB7fF3c333D167f3) with the apprentices, and they start experimenting with governing common resources, allocation mechanisms and voting. \n\nStewards that mantain their workspace updated for an entire sun cycle will receive a [Hypercert](https://app.hypercerts.org/hypercerts/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-19396094914493492417412352623610788052992) attesting their contribution to the DAO \n\nWe believe that by investing Gitcoin funds in education and capacity building among stewards we will be able to generate a fertile ground for cosmo-local partnerships, which can in turn feed back to support more education. \n\n# Volunteering Network 💪\n\n[![sarafu.png](https://i.postimg.cc/6380MT68/sarafu.png)](https://postimg.cc/k6dK4JbC)\n\nThe JA1 apprentices stressed the importance of supporting stewards that are Hosts in web2 networks of travellers and volunteers. We then decided to experiment with a common pool where Hosts can withdraw usd after delivering a volunteering report [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network/pools/0x0788459989F726Fd110897a20Faa990D6ef57E6A)\n\n[![unlockprotocol.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g0XtJtFw/unlockprotocol.png)](https://postimg.cc/B83B7gvs)\n\nVolunteers are invited to join AgroforestDAO and are recognized by receiving an email with Unlock Protocol's certificates (keys) issued in a shared account (lock) of Hosts. They are invited to follow and join AgroforestDAO Journeys. \n\n# Overall Experience 🐜\n\nOnboarding people from different regions of Brazil has been an incredible experience for the past 8 months. So much diversity and stories, so many possibilities for collaboration, all grounded in seasonality.\n\n[![imagemro-aconectada.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FRPMqWSD/imagemro-aconectada.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bDtVSR3t)\n\nMany local agentes are starting to experience the benefits of being part of a global tribe and realize that they are not alone anymore.

While each of us has been striving in our primary role to revive public goods in our projects, in our individual and collective capacity, we have been championing the need to fund, design, develop, and market a future rooted in regeneration.\n\n# Activities\n\n- Throughout the year, we have published educational articles on our online publication [Gulshan](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india) on topics such as:\n\n    -   [navigating challenges for regen founders](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/navigating-regen-movement)\n    -   [the role of inquiry in regen's future](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/role-of-inquiry)\n    -   [inspirations from nature for mechanism design](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/mechanism-design)\n    -   [the legacy of the Chipko Movement in India](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/chipko)\n    -   [key takeaways for India from the GreenPill book](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/programmable-money)\n\n-   June 2024: Establish a partnership with a retainer contract with a local biodiversity farm, [Nature Inspires](https://www.facebook.com/NIChiguruecospace/), based near Bangalore, to drive immersive educational experiences on actionable insights for eco-friendly sustainable living\n\n-   March 2024: Conducted a [half-day community visit](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/farm-visit) to Nature Inspires farm, Chiguru Ecospace, to bridge the world of web3 enthusiasts, builders, and thinkers with the grassroots wisdom of sustainable living.\n\n-   March 2024: Designed and delivered a [2-day workshop on DAOs](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/dao) for faculty at Punjabi University Centre for Emerging and Innovative Technology\n\n-   February 2024: Conducted [workshop on understanding and applying quadratic voting](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/qv) for collective decision-making\n\n-   December 2023: Conducted session on [Role of Crypto in Public Goods](https://x.com/Atlantis_p2p/status/1731932427554116074) at [Interfaces](https://lu.ma/interfaces) Unconference at the Indian Institute of Science\n\n# Challenges\n\nOur ongoing challenge is community building. So far, all the activities have been driven by the core team. We are planning to scale the operations using the Impact Miner app, which can reward volunteers and contributors for their actions using the grant funding and, in return, help codify their impact onchain.\n\n# Wins\n\nThe most rewarding part of running the chapter activities is introducing the affordances of blockchain technology to non-crypto audiences and explaining how the Lego blocks stack together for new solutions for some of the most complex challenges, from funding open-source software to climate action.\n\n![](https://paragraph.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F47b00ad1fad236ffb3294b062f23fcfc.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\n\n# Path Forward\n\nGreenPill India aspires to create spaces where dialogues can flourish and debates can be hosted to bring code and culture together to challenge the status quo and build plural pathways for an equitable future.\n\nThe core team will continue to offer their time for the chapter with no expectation of compensation. We want to enable funding for volunteers and contributors who drive action on the ground. For this purpose, we will utilize the capital allocation workflow using the Impact Miner app from Atlantis.\nWe will continue using residual and new funds raised for the following:\n\n-   Upcoming focus: Expand the core group's subject matter expertise to new community members and enable them to scale independent projects, events, and activities\n-   Use of funds: Cost of logistics to host events.

While each of us has been striving in our primary role to revive public goods in our projects, in our individual and collective capacity, we have been championing the need to fund, design, develop, and market a future rooted in regeneration.\n\n# Activities\n\n- Throughout the year, we have published educational articles on our online publication [Gulshan](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india) on topics such as:\n\n    -   [navigating challenges for regen founders](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/navigating-regen-movement)\n    -   [the role of inquiry in regen's future](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/role-of-inquiry)\n    -   [inspirations from nature for mechanism design](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/mechanism-design)\n    -   [the legacy of the Chipko Movement in India](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/chipko)\n    -   [key takeaways for India from the GreenPill book](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/programmable-money)\n\n-   June 2024: Establish a partnership with a retainer contract with a local biodiversity farm, [Nature Inspires](https://www.facebook.com/NIChiguruecospace/), based near Bangalore, to drive immersive educational experiences on actionable insights for eco-friendly sustainable living\n\n-   March 2024: Conducted a [half-day community visit](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/farm-visit) to Nature Inspires farm, Chiguru Ecospace, to bridge the world of web3 enthusiasts, builders, and thinkers with the grassroots wisdom of sustainable living.\n\n-   March 2024: Designed and delivered a [2-day workshop on DAOs](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/dao) for faculty at Punjabi University Centre for Emerging and Innovative Technology\n\n-   February 2024: Conducted [workshop on understanding and applying quadratic voting](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/qv) for collective decision-making\n\n-   December 2023: Conducted session on [Role of Crypto in Public Goods](https://x.com/Atlantis_p2p/status/1731932427554116074) at [Interfaces](https://lu.ma/interfaces) Unconference at the Indian Institute of Science\n\n# Challenges\n\nOur ongoing challenge is community building. So far, all the activities have been driven by the core team. We are planning to scale the operations using the Impact Miner app, which can reward volunteers and contributors for their actions using the grant funding and, in return, help codify their impact onchain.\n\n# Wins\n\nThe most rewarding part of running the chapter activities is introducing the affordances of blockchain technology to non-crypto audiences and explaining how the Lego blocks stack together for new solutions for some of the most complex challenges, from funding open-source software to climate action.\n\n![](https://paragraph.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F47b00ad1fad236ffb3294b062f23fcfc.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\n\n# Path Forward\n\nGreenPill India aspires to create spaces where dialogues can flourish and debates can be hosted to bring code and culture together to challenge the status quo and build plural pathways for an equitable future.\n\nThe core team will continue to offer their time for the chapter with no expectation of compensation. We want to enable funding for volunteers and contributors who drive action on the ground. For this purpose, we will utilize the capital allocation workflow using the Impact Miner app from Atlantis.\nWe will continue using residual and new funds raised for the following:\n\n-   Upcoming focus: Expand the core group's subject matter expertise to new community members and enable them to scale independent projects, events, and activities\n-   Use of funds: Cost of logistics to host events. Incentivizing members with relevant skills to own and deliver curated bounties for delivering on chapter priorities using Impact Miner\n-   Type of events: Highly curated in-person experiences to introduce and apply regenerative concepts to fund and thrive public goods in India\n-   Measuring success: Quality of engagement, type of events, and number of artifacts produced as part of our communication and outreach","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"GreenPill_IND"},"metadataCid":"bafkreig3owhmegrtuk4ctwuiqf6n3at6hou3wz5s46gw5lylijyomc7uaa","timestamp":"2024-03-20T06:58:34+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x8C180840fcBb90CE8464B4eCd12ab0f840c6647C","createdAtBlock":192255451},{"name":"GreenPill

\"ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration\")\n\n# Overview\n\n**ReFi Mediterranean** is focused on catalyzing **Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and Web3** technologies across the Mediterranean bioregion. Rooted in ancient wisdom and modern innovation, we seek to create a unified network of local nodes, organizations, and projects dedicated to addressing the region's ecological, social, and economic challenges. Through collaboration, resource sharing, and impact-driven strategies, we aim to align diverse efforts under a shared vision of bioregional regeneration.\n\nWith its unique blend of cultures, landscapes, and histories, the Mediterranean region is both a site of profound challenges and rich opportunities for regeneration. By weaving together the strengths of grassroots movements and cutting-edge digital tools, ReFi Mediterranean will foster a coordinated response to crises such as climate change, rural depopulation, and economic stagnation. Through a phased approach, ReFi Mediterranean will begin by mapping and connecting regenerative finance nodes and assets across the region, eventually scaling toward a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy** and establishing a **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** to support long-term transformation.\n\n# Our Bioregion: A Tapestry of Land, Sea, and Culture\n\nThe Mediterranean, often hailed as the cradle of civilization, is a bioregion where history, culture, and nature have been intricately woven together for millennia. The Mediterranean is a complex mosaic, its boundaries defined not by political borders but by the rhythms of nature and shared cultural heritage. Our bioregion encompasses four key areas:\n\n- **West**: The sun-drenched coasts of Portugal, Spain, and southern France.\n- **Central**: The Italian peninsula and the Adriatic shores of Croatia.\n- **East**: The ancient lands of Greece, coastal Türkiye, and the Levant.\n- **South**: The North African coast, stretching from Morocco to Egypt.\n\nAt the heart of our bioregion lies the Mediterranean Sea, an azure thread connecting diverse landscapes and cultures. For centuries, it has served as a conduit for trade, exchanging not just goods but ideas, languages, and ways of life. The very essence of Mediterranean culture—from our olive oil and wine to our philosophies and art—has been shaped by this intermingling of peoples and traditions.\n\nToday the Mediterranean stands at a crossroads, facing a web of interconnected challenges. Climate collapse, political turmoil, and economic instability have cast long shadows over this once-flourishing bioregion. Mass tourism threatens to turn vibrant local cultures into mere backdrops for vacation photos, while fossil fuel extraction risks transforming the Mediterranean Sea into a gas field and potential conflict zone. The impacts of climate change, including droughts, wildfires, and desertification, are increasingly severe, and political instability in the southern regions has sparked humanitarian crises as people seek safety across treacherous waters. The Mediterranean also contends with bureaucratic inertia, rural depopulation, and the ongoing migration crisis, which further strain the region’s ecosystems and communities. Industrial agriculture and political borders disrupt the natural interconnectedness of the region, while the Mediterranean Sea suffers from pollution, overfishing, and other environmental pressures.\n\nYet, within each of these challenges lies the seed of opportunity for regeneration. Communities are banding together to organize reforestation efforts and fire watch activities. The spread of regenerative agriculture and syntropic agroforestry, adapted to the unique Mediterranean climate, offers pathways to heal depleted soils, revitalize rural areas, and create stronger community bonds. We are also witnessing a reverse migration, as people from northern Europe trade their corporate jobs for a slower, sun-soaked lifestyle. This influx is breathing new life into abandoned areas and sparking the creation of innovative ecovillages, like the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/) in Portugal.\n\nWhile ReFi Mediterranean does not seek to tackle all of the regions challenges at once, it aims to build on our network's strengths and play our part in creating ripples of transformation that lead to systemic change. Our efforts will lay groundwork for a comprehensive [Bioregional Regeneration Strategy](https://www.biofi.earth/activation-guide), guiding the Mediterranean toward a regenerative and resilient future. We seek to unite efforts, weaving together ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology to form a cohesive network of regeneration. We aim to restore the sacred balance between people, land, and sea, ensuring the Mediterranean becomes a beacon of sustainability and resilience for generations to come.\n\nThe essence of our vision: not merely to live the \"sweet life\" (la dolce vita) - for which the Mediterranean is famed - but to build a \"regenerative life\" (**la vita rigenerativa**) that restores balance and harmony to our bioregion.\n\n![ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration](https://i.ibb.co/Tv4SZrk/med.png \"ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration\")\n\n# Our Organizing Team: A Nested Network of Changemakers\n\nThe ReFi Mediterranean initiative is a vibrant, nested network of local nodes, projects, and regional coordinating bodies, each deeply rooted in their specific territories and communities. This structure allows for agile, localized action while fostering cohesion and collaboration across the bioregion. Together, we are building a movement that combines place-based regenerative practices with cutting-edge Web3 tools, uniting diverse projects and changemakers under a shared vision. Our current Bioregional Organizing Team includes representation from:\n\n1. **[Rifai Sicilia](https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia) (Italy)**: Serving as a cultural association dedicated to regenerating Sicily's ecology by fostering a thriving bioregional economy through agroecology, reforestation and rehydration of the watershed. We unite regional projects and initiatives, leveraging culture and technology as transformative tools to revalue our territory.\n2. **[ReFi Calabria](https://mariafalbo.substack.com/p/a-new-dawn-and-a-new-sacred-order) (Italy):** Pioneering sacred and cultural regeneration by laying the spiritual and relational foundations for practical regeneration to take place in right relationship with the land and the local land based communities. This includes a blueprint for regeneration that follows the principles of cosmo-erotic humanism and decolonial practices. This deep, devotional approach is reigniting hope in local communities and providing a model for weaving together the seen and unseen realms in regenerative work.\n3. **[ReFi Italia](https://x.com/ReFi_Italia) (Italy):** A community of regens addressing the pressing challenges of ecological decline and social disparity in Italy. Our bioregion is experiencing a rapid loss of biodiversity, coupled with economic hardship and a decline in traditional knowledge. To reverse this trend, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological restoration, community empowerment, and technological innovation. Italy's rich biodiversity and cultural heritage provide a unique canvas for our work. By spinning up and supporting new regional nodes (such as Sicilia & Calabria) we are committed to inspiring a nationwide movement towards regeneration.\n4. **[ReFi Barcelona](https://x.com/ReFiBCN) (Spain)**: is a collective dedicated to linking the global ReFi movement with local efforts in Barcelona and Catalunya, particularly within the cooperative and ecosocial transition ecosystems. We focus on building connections between decentralized technologies, regenerative finance, and groups already working on the ground to drive immediate benefits. By constituting ReFi BCN as a cooperative, we aim to create a shared structure that enhances collaboration and resource sharing, aligning global tools with local needs for real-world impact.\n5. **[ReFi Lisboa](https://x.com/ReFiLisboa) (Portugal)**: ReFi Lisboa has been instrumental in exploring how Web3 tools can support rural revitalization efforts, connecting digital nomads with regenerative communities.\n6. **[Earthist DAO](https://x.com/earthistdao) (Türkiye)**: Earthist DAO has been experimenting with innovative governance models and community-led funding mechanisms, using streaming quadratic funding to reward community members and employing data-driven ecological decision-making tools.\n7. **[Traditional Dream Factory](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/) (Portugal)**: TDF has become a living laboratory for blending regenerative land practices with DAO governance, creating new token-based systems such as Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat to incentivize physical stewardship of the land.\n8. **[Copson Universe](https://www.copsonlondon.com/) (Italy)**: A storytelling and amplification node, Copson Universe plays a key role in capturing and sharing the rewritten narratives of regeneration. Through innovative media and digital tools, they inspire both local communities and a global audience, acting as a cultural bridge between worlds while advocating for [decolonial and sacred practices](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146).\n9. **[Solarpunk Nomads](https://www.solarpunknomads.xyz/) (Italy)**: ****Creating safe spaces in the Alps of Italia and around the world for solar punk nomads to envision and embody regenerative living with solar punk values.\n\n### Core Team & Leadership\n\nIn this initial formative phase, ReFi Mediterranean is being led by a core group of leaders with input from a broader network of representatives and advisers. This collaborative leadership structure allows for flexibility and responsiveness as the initiative takes shape. As ReFi Mediterranean matures, the aim is to further establish, formalise, and decentralise the organizational structure, ensuring that it evolves in alignment with the needs of the bioregion and its growing network.\n\n**Current Leadership for ReFi Mediterranean**:\n\n- **Regen Avocado** (Rifai Sicilia) - https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia\n- **Raffaele Izzia** (ReFi Italia) - https://x.com/izziaraffaele\n- **Maria Falbo** (ReFi Calabria & Copson Universe) - https://linktr.ee/mariafalbo\n- **Monty Merlin** (ReFi DAO & Regen Coordination) - https://linktr.ee/montybryant\n- **Luiz Fernando** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/louizfe\n\n**Network Representatives and Advisers**:\n\n- **Rica** (ReFi Lisboa) - https://linktr.ee/ricaax\n- **Andrea Farias** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/andrea_is_a\n- **Samuel Delesque** (Traditional Dream Factory) - https://samueldelesque.me/\n- **Sohto** (Earthist & ReFi Turkey) - https://x.com/soht0\n- **Scott Morris** (ReFi DAO) - https://x.com/thetokenjedi\n\nThe power of ReFi Mediterranean lies in its ability to bring together a diverse network of changemakers, each with their own unique expertise, vision, and connection to place. As we deepen our connections across the bioregion, we are cultivating a movement that is not just about solving immediate crises but about creating long-lasting systems of regeneration.\n\n# Our Vision: Uniting for Bioregional Regeneration\n\nReFi Mediterranean seeks to connect and scale the efforts of its local ReFi nodes and aligned projects, building on existing regenerative work to create synergies that enhance collaboration and maximize collective impact across the bioregion. Many of the activities listed below are already in progress within local nodes, and the plan is to coordinate and expand these initiatives to deepen their regenerative impact across the Mediterranean.\n\n### Immediate Focus (Short-Term)\n\n1. **Education, Resource Sharing, and Ecosystem Mapping**: Local nodes are gathering practical resources on ReFi apps, Web3 tools, decentralized governance, and regenerative practices tailored to their specific communities. ReFi Mediterranean will scale these efforts by creating an ecosystem map that highlights ReFi-aligned initiatives across the Mediterranean, connecting local value-driven movements with global tech-enablers. This comprehensive map will serve as a tool for collaboration and broader community education across the bioregion.\n2. **Network Building**: Local nodes are organizing workshops and meetups to foster connections. By coordinating these efforts, ReFi Mediterranean will establish a bioregion-wide network of regenerative projects, strengthening partnerships and facilitating shared learning through conferences and collaborative events.\n3. **Cultural and Spiritual Regeneration**: Local nodes are working to revitalize sacred practices and embed decolonial approaches. ReFi Mediterranean aims to expand these efforts, positioning the Mediterranean as a hub for cultural, spiritual, and agricultural renewal that transcends tourism.\n4. **Storytelling and Amplification**: Many nodes are already capturing and [sharing stories of regeneration.](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146) ReFi Mediterranean will scale this work by developing a cohesive multimedia narrative that amplifies local efforts, engages global audiences, and invites wider participation in regenerative initiatives.\n\n### Building the Foundations (Mid-Term)\n\n1. **Funding and Support**: Participatory mechanisms for fund allocation are already in use by local groups. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale these processes, facilitating transparent and impactful resource distribution to regenerative projects across the bioregion.\n2. **Data Commons and Ecological Monitoring**: Several nodes are developing systems to track ecological health and monitor regenerative progress. ReFi Mediterranean aims to build on this by creating a shared data infrastructure to aggregate and share this information across the region, supporting informed decision-making and collective impact reporting.\n\n### Future Horizon (Long-Term)\n\n1. **Regenerative Marketplace and Investment Fund**: Some local nodes are exploring regenerative markets and revenue-sharing models. ReFi Mediterranean aims to establish an on-chain marketplace where regenerative producers can sell their products, with portions of revenues reinvested into community treasuries to support local regeneration.\n2. **Bioregional Investment Fund**: As funding needs grow, ReFi Mediterranean envisions creating a bioregion-wide investment fund to channel larger investments into critical regenerative infrastructure projects, fostering sustainable growth.\n3. **Policy Innovation Lab**: Some nodes are already engaging with policymakers. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale this by collaborating across the region to pilot innovative governance models that align with bioregional principles, driving systemic change.\n4. **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & BFF**: Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs in the region to develop a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy that can inform the further development of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFF) to support long-term regenerative projects and systemic change across the Mediterranean.\n\nBy coordinating and scaling these activities, ReFi Mediterranean aims to build a connected, resilient bioregional ecosystem. This network not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term pathways to systemic regeneration and renewal. Aligned with the broader Regen Coordination movement, ReFi Mediterranean seeks to develop common infrastructure and alignment across the ecosystem, focusing on the aggregation of impact data from connected organizations. This data will be linked to both local and global funding sources to maximize transparency and effectiveness in resource allocation. As the network expands, ReFi Mediterranean aims to deepen collaboration between local nodes, amplifying shared efforts while building a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Through this process of mapping, knowledge-sharing, and coordinated resource management, ReFi Mediterranean aspires to create the necessary pathways for scaling regenerative finance across the Mediterranean, fostering systemic change throughout the bioregion.\n\n# Our Finances: Innovating Resource Flows\n\nOur approach to finance is as interconnected as the Mediterranean itself. We're pioneering a nested model of resource management that allows for local autonomy while fostering bioregion-wide collaboration.\n\n### Current Financial Ecosystem\n\n1. **Local Node Fundraising**: Each node raises funds independently, often through platforms like Gitcoin & ReFi DAO’s Local Node funding rounds.\n2. **Transparent Distribution**: Funds raised are often redistributed to local projects through open, participatory processes. ReFi Italia has been a leader in this, facilitating collective decision-making on fund allocation. ReFi Barcelona is also experimenting with a Quadratic Funding round for their local network.\n3. **Impact Tracking**: Nodes like RiFai Sicilia and Earthist DAO are using platforms like Bloom Network to write impact reports, earning FLO tokens that can be converted into other cryptocurrencies.\n4. **Yield Generation**: We're learning to manage on-chain treasuries, including strategies for generating yield on idle funds through DeFi protocols.\n\n### Vision for BioFi Resource Management\n\nAs we evolve, we're working towards a more sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem that reimagines where value is placed and how it flows:\n\n1. **Bioregional Treasury**: We're establishing a BioFi Mediterranean multi-sig wallet, with representatives from each local node as signers. This will allow us to manage bioregion-wide resources collectively.\n2. **Nested Governance**: Local nodes will maintain their own treasuries and decision-making processes, nested within the larger bioregional structure. This allows for customized local solutions while enabling coordination on larger initiatives.\n3. **Participatory Allocation**: We're developing mechanisms for participatory budgeting at multiple scales, from local nodes up to the bioregional level.\n4. **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: We're exploring the creation of a Mediterranean regenerative token system that could facilitate value exchange across the bioregion while incentivizing regenerative activities.\n5. **Blended Finance Approaches**: We aim to create pathways for traditional finance to support our work, potentially through mechanisms like green bonds or impact investing vehicles tailored to bioregional regeneration.\n6. **Value Reimagination**: Inspired by models such as the [Eight Forms of Capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf), we're pioneering a shift in how financial value is perceived and allocated. Instead of focusing solely on consumer goods, we're creating mechanisms to direct financial flows towards building regenerative futures, supporting sacred practices, and nurturing love within our communities.\n7. **Cultural Onboarding and Web3 Bridge**: We're developing innovative storytelling approaches to onboard cultural interest in our bioregional regeneration efforts, weaving together ancient Mediterranean mythology with new narratives. We aim to bridge cultural gaps within diverse Mediterranean communities and between traditional and new economies. This includes creating accessible educational materials about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in local languages and dialects, inviting wider participation and financial contributions towards building a thriving future for our bioregion.\n\n# Our Action Plan: A Phased Approach to Transformation\n\nThe ambition of ReFi Mediterranean is far-reaching, with the ultimate goal of accelerating a regenerative transition across the bioregion. However, to manage scope effectively and ensure success, a phased approach has been developed, with clear, achievable actions and milestones to guide progress. Given the potential size of the resources raised from this grant application, the primary focus will be on fulfilling Phase 1 of the action plan. This will lay the foundation for further development, with an intention to initiate collaborations and raise additional funding to support subsequent phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Mapping and Case Study Library\n\n- **Goal**: To establish a comprehensive overview of local nodes and projects within the Mediterranean region.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Map ReFi local nodes and place-based ReFi & Web3 activities across the region.\n    - Create a **Case Study Library** documenting the models and activities being implemented.\n    - Gain insights into the diverse applications of ReFi Web3 technologies and use these insights to inform the next phases of ReFi Mediterranean and other bioregional strategies.\n\n### Phase 2: Bioregional Impact Data Commons\n\n- **Goal**: To create a shared data infrastructure that supports the aggregation of impact data across local nodes and projects.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Develop a **Bioregional Data Commons** to monitor ecological health, track regenerative efforts, and guide decision-making.\n    - In collaboration with **Regen Coordination**, design and implement a collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for the ecosystem of ReFi Mediterranean.\n    - Bring impact data on-chain, ensuring transparency and verifiability through Web3 technologies. This system will enable accurate and reliable reporting from local nodes and projects, fostering coherence, trust, and transparency.\n    - Aggregate this data for alignment with local and global grant sources and technology solutions.\n\nAs ReFi Mediterranean becomes proficient in measuring, aggregating, and reporting its impact, it will attract a broader range of capital beyond Web3 grant funding, diversifying its financing and reinvesting resources into regenerative projects.\n\n### Phase 3: Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)\n\n- **Goal**: To create a comprehesive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and establish a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) to support regenerative initiatives in the Mediterranean.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs and stakeholders, including local governments and NGOs, to develop a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.\n    - Use this strategy as the foundation for launching the first **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** in the Mediterranean, a key resource for scaling regenerative projects.\n    - Establish financial support systems and capital distribution mechanisms to effectively fund ReFi Mediterranean initiatives.\n    - Expand the ReFi Toolkit, knowledge resources, and frameworks for ecosystem-wide adoption.\n\n# Thank you 💚\n\nOnly together can we build a regenerative future, for our bioregion and beyond.

We aim to restore the sacred balance between people, land, and sea, ensuring the Mediterranean becomes a beacon of sustainability and resilience for generations to come.\n\nThe essence of our vision: not merely to live the \"sweet life\" (la dolce vita) - for which the Mediterranean is famed - but to build a \"regenerative life\" (**la vita rigenerativa**) that restores balance and harmony to our bioregion.\n\n![ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration](https://i.ibb.co/Tv4SZrk/med.png \"ReFi Mediterranean - A Bioregional ReFi DAO Node for holistic Regeneration\")\n\n# Our Organizing Team: A Nested Network of Changemakers\n\nThe ReFi Mediterranean initiative is a vibrant, nested network of local nodes, projects, and regional coordinating bodies, each deeply rooted in their specific territories and communities. This structure allows for agile, localized action while fostering cohesion and collaboration across the bioregion. Together, we are building a movement that combines place-based regenerative practices with cutting-edge Web3 tools, uniting diverse projects and changemakers under a shared vision. Our current Bioregional Organizing Team includes representation from:\n\n1. **[Rifai Sicilia](https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia) (Italy)**: Serving as a cultural association dedicated to regenerating Sicily's ecology by fostering a thriving bioregional economy through agroecology, reforestation and rehydration of the watershed. We unite regional projects and initiatives, leveraging culture and technology as transformative tools to revalue our territory.\n2. **[ReFi Calabria](https://mariafalbo.substack.com/p/a-new-dawn-and-a-new-sacred-order) (Italy):** Pioneering sacred and cultural regeneration by laying the spiritual and relational foundations for practical regeneration to take place in right relationship with the land and the local land based communities. This includes a blueprint for regeneration that follows the principles of cosmo-erotic humanism and decolonial practices. This deep, devotional approach is reigniting hope in local communities and providing a model for weaving together the seen and unseen realms in regenerative work.\n3. **[ReFi Italia](https://x.com/ReFi_Italia) (Italy):** A community of regens addressing the pressing challenges of ecological decline and social disparity in Italy. Our bioregion is experiencing a rapid loss of biodiversity, coupled with economic hardship and a decline in traditional knowledge. To reverse this trend, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological restoration, community empowerment, and technological innovation. Italy's rich biodiversity and cultural heritage provide a unique canvas for our work. By spinning up and supporting new regional nodes (such as Sicilia & Calabria) we are committed to inspiring a nationwide movement towards regeneration.\n4. **[ReFi Barcelona](https://x.com/ReFiBCN) (Spain)**: is a collective dedicated to linking the global ReFi movement with local efforts in Barcelona and Catalunya, particularly within the cooperative and ecosocial transition ecosystems. We focus on building connections between decentralized technologies, regenerative finance, and groups already working on the ground to drive immediate benefits. By constituting ReFi BCN as a cooperative, we aim to create a shared structure that enhances collaboration and resource sharing, aligning global tools with local needs for real-world impact.\n5. **[ReFi Lisboa](https://x.com/ReFiLisboa) (Portugal)**: ReFi Lisboa has been instrumental in exploring how Web3 tools can support rural revitalization efforts, connecting digital nomads with regenerative communities.\n6. **[Earthist DAO](https://x.com/earthistdao) (Türkiye)**: Earthist DAO has been experimenting with innovative governance models and community-led funding mechanisms, using streaming quadratic funding to reward community members and employing data-driven ecological decision-making tools.\n7. **[Traditional Dream Factory](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/) (Portugal)**: TDF has become a living laboratory for blending regenerative land practices with DAO governance, creating new token-based systems such as Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat to incentivize physical stewardship of the land.\n8. **[Copson Universe](https://www.copsonlondon.com/) (Italy)**: A storytelling and amplification node, Copson Universe plays a key role in capturing and sharing the rewritten narratives of regeneration. Through innovative media and digital tools, they inspire both local communities and a global audience, acting as a cultural bridge between worlds while advocating for [decolonial and sacred practices](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146).\n9. **[Solarpunk Nomads](https://www.solarpunknomads.xyz/) (Italy)**: ****Creating safe spaces in the Alps of Italia and around the world for solar punk nomads to envision and embody regenerative living with solar punk values.\n\n### Core Team & Leadership\n\nIn this initial formative phase, ReFi Mediterranean is being led by a core group of leaders with input from a broader network of representatives and advisers. This collaborative leadership structure allows for flexibility and responsiveness as the initiative takes shape. As ReFi Mediterranean matures, the aim is to further establish, formalise, and decentralise the organizational structure, ensuring that it evolves in alignment with the needs of the bioregion and its growing network.\n\n**Current Leadership for ReFi Mediterranean**:\n\n- **Regen Avocado** (Rifai Sicilia) - https://linktr.ee/rifaisicilia\n- **Raffaele Izzia** (ReFi Italia) - https://x.com/izziaraffaele\n- **Maria Falbo** (ReFi Calabria & Copson Universe) - https://linktr.ee/mariafalbo\n- **Monty Merlin** (ReFi DAO & Regen Coordination) - https://linktr.ee/montybryant\n- **Luiz Fernando** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/louizfe\n\n**Network Representatives and Advisers**:\n\n- **Rica** (ReFi Lisboa) - https://linktr.ee/ricaax\n- **Andrea Farias** (ReFi Barcelona) - https://x.com/andrea_is_a\n- **Samuel Delesque** (Traditional Dream Factory) - https://samueldelesque.me/\n- **Sohto** (Earthist & ReFi Turkey) - https://x.com/soht0\n- **Scott Morris** (ReFi DAO) - https://x.com/thetokenjedi\n\nThe power of ReFi Mediterranean lies in its ability to bring together a diverse network of changemakers, each with their own unique expertise, vision, and connection to place. As we deepen our connections across the bioregion, we are cultivating a movement that is not just about solving immediate crises but about creating long-lasting systems of regeneration.\n\n# Our Vision: Uniting for Bioregional Regeneration\n\nReFi Mediterranean seeks to connect and scale the efforts of its local ReFi nodes and aligned projects, building on existing regenerative work to create synergies that enhance collaboration and maximize collective impact across the bioregion. Many of the activities listed below are already in progress within local nodes, and the plan is to coordinate and expand these initiatives to deepen their regenerative impact across the Mediterranean.\n\n### Immediate Focus (Short-Term)\n\n1. **Education, Resource Sharing, and Ecosystem Mapping**: Local nodes are gathering practical resources on ReFi apps, Web3 tools, decentralized governance, and regenerative practices tailored to their specific communities. ReFi Mediterranean will scale these efforts by creating an ecosystem map that highlights ReFi-aligned initiatives across the Mediterranean, connecting local value-driven movements with global tech-enablers. This comprehensive map will serve as a tool for collaboration and broader community education across the bioregion.\n2. **Network Building**: Local nodes are organizing workshops and meetups to foster connections. By coordinating these efforts, ReFi Mediterranean will establish a bioregion-wide network of regenerative projects, strengthening partnerships and facilitating shared learning through conferences and collaborative events.\n3. **Cultural and Spiritual Regeneration**: Local nodes are working to revitalize sacred practices and embed decolonial approaches. ReFi Mediterranean aims to expand these efforts, positioning the Mediterranean as a hub for cultural, spiritual, and agricultural renewal that transcends tourism.\n4. **Storytelling and Amplification**: Many nodes are already capturing and [sharing stories of regeneration.](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146) ReFi Mediterranean will scale this work by developing a cohesive multimedia narrative that amplifies local efforts, engages global audiences, and invites wider participation in regenerative initiatives.\n\n### Building the Foundations (Mid-Term)\n\n1. **Funding and Support**: Participatory mechanisms for fund allocation are already in use by local groups. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale these processes, facilitating transparent and impactful resource distribution to regenerative projects across the bioregion.\n2. **Data Commons and Ecological Monitoring**: Several nodes are developing systems to track ecological health and monitor regenerative progress. ReFi Mediterranean aims to build on this by creating a shared data infrastructure to aggregate and share this information across the region, supporting informed decision-making and collective impact reporting.\n\n### Future Horizon (Long-Term)\n\n1. **Regenerative Marketplace and Investment Fund**: Some local nodes are exploring regenerative markets and revenue-sharing models. ReFi Mediterranean aims to establish an on-chain marketplace where regenerative producers can sell their products, with portions of revenues reinvested into community treasuries to support local regeneration.\n2. **Bioregional Investment Fund**: As funding needs grow, ReFi Mediterranean envisions creating a bioregion-wide investment fund to channel larger investments into critical regenerative infrastructure projects, fostering sustainable growth.\n3. **Policy Innovation Lab**: Some nodes are already engaging with policymakers. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale this by collaborating across the region to pilot innovative governance models that align with bioregional principles, driving systemic change.\n4. **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & BFF**: Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs in the region to develop a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy that can inform the further development of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFF) to support long-term regenerative projects and systemic change across the Mediterranean.\n\nBy coordinating and scaling these activities, ReFi Mediterranean aims to build a connected, resilient bioregional ecosystem. This network not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term pathways to systemic regeneration and renewal. Aligned with the broader Regen Coordination movement, ReFi Mediterranean seeks to develop common infrastructure and alignment across the ecosystem, focusing on the aggregation of impact data from connected organizations. This data will be linked to both local and global funding sources to maximize transparency and effectiveness in resource allocation. As the network expands, ReFi Mediterranean aims to deepen collaboration between local nodes, amplifying shared efforts while building a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Through this process of mapping, knowledge-sharing, and coordinated resource management, ReFi Mediterranean aspires to create the necessary pathways for scaling regenerative finance across the Mediterranean, fostering systemic change throughout the bioregion.\n\n# Our Finances: Innovating Resource Flows\n\nOur approach to finance is as interconnected as the Mediterranean itself. We're pioneering a nested model of resource management that allows for local autonomy while fostering bioregion-wide collaboration.\n\n### Current Financial Ecosystem\n\n1. **Local Node Fundraising**: Each node raises funds independently, often through platforms like Gitcoin & ReFi DAO’s Local Node funding rounds.\n2. **Transparent Distribution**: Funds raised are often redistributed to local projects through open, participatory processes. ReFi Italia has been a leader in this, facilitating collective decision-making on fund allocation. ReFi Barcelona is also experimenting with a Quadratic Funding round for their local network.\n3. **Impact Tracking**: Nodes like RiFai Sicilia and Earthist DAO are using platforms like Bloom Network to write impact reports, earning FLO tokens that can be converted into other cryptocurrencies.\n4. **Yield Generation**: We're learning to manage on-chain treasuries, including strategies for generating yield on idle funds through DeFi protocols.\n\n### Vision for BioFi Resource Management\n\nAs we evolve, we're working towards a more sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem that reimagines where value is placed and how it flows:\n\n1. **Bioregional Treasury**: We're establishing a BioFi Mediterranean multi-sig wallet, with representatives from each local node as signers. This will allow us to manage bioregion-wide resources collectively.\n2. **Nested Governance**: Local nodes will maintain their own treasuries and decision-making processes, nested within the larger bioregional structure. This allows for customized local solutions while enabling coordination on larger initiatives.\n3. **Participatory Allocation**: We're developing mechanisms for participatory budgeting at multiple scales, from local nodes up to the bioregional level.\n4. **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: We're exploring the creation of a Mediterranean regenerative token system that could facilitate value exchange across the bioregion while incentivizing regenerative activities.\n5. **Blended Finance Approaches**: We aim to create pathways for traditional finance to support our work, potentially through mechanisms like green bonds or impact investing vehicles tailored to bioregional regeneration.\n6. **Value Reimagination**: Inspired by models such as the [Eight Forms of Capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf), we're pioneering a shift in how financial value is perceived and allocated. Instead of focusing solely on consumer goods, we're creating mechanisms to direct financial flows towards building regenerative futures, supporting sacred practices, and nurturing love within our communities.\n7. **Cultural Onboarding and Web3 Bridge**: We're developing innovative storytelling approaches to onboard cultural interest in our bioregional regeneration efforts, weaving together ancient Mediterranean mythology with new narratives. We aim to bridge cultural gaps within diverse Mediterranean communities and between traditional and new economies. This includes creating accessible educational materials about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in local languages and dialects, inviting wider participation and financial contributions towards building a thriving future for our bioregion.\n\n# Our Action Plan: A Phased Approach to Transformation\n\nThe ambition of ReFi Mediterranean is far-reaching, with the ultimate goal of accelerating a regenerative transition across the bioregion. However, to manage scope effectively and ensure success, a phased approach has been developed, with clear, achievable actions and milestones to guide progress. Given the potential size of the resources raised from this grant application, the primary focus will be on fulfilling Phase 1 of the action plan. This will lay the foundation for further development, with an intention to initiate collaborations and raise additional funding to support subsequent phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Mapping and Case Study Library\n\n- **Goal**: To establish a comprehensive overview of local nodes and projects within the Mediterranean region.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Map ReFi local nodes and place-based ReFi & Web3 activities across the region.\n    - Create a **Case Study Library** documenting the models and activities being implemented.\n    - Gain insights into the diverse applications of ReFi Web3 technologies and use these insights to inform the next phases of ReFi Mediterranean and other bioregional strategies.\n\n### Phase 2: Bioregional Impact Data Commons\n\n- **Goal**: To create a shared data infrastructure that supports the aggregation of impact data across local nodes and projects.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Develop a **Bioregional Data Commons** to monitor ecological health, track regenerative efforts, and guide decision-making.\n    - In collaboration with **Regen Coordination**, design and implement a collective impact measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for the ecosystem of ReFi Mediterranean.\n    - Bring impact data on-chain, ensuring transparency and verifiability through Web3 technologies. This system will enable accurate and reliable reporting from local nodes and projects, fostering coherence, trust, and transparency.\n    - Aggregate this data for alignment with local and global grant sources and technology solutions.\n\nAs ReFi Mediterranean becomes proficient in measuring, aggregating, and reporting its impact, it will attract a broader range of capital beyond Web3 grant funding, diversifying its financing and reinvesting resources into regenerative projects.\n\n### Phase 3: Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)\n\n- **Goal**: To create a comprehesive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy and establish a Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF) to support regenerative initiatives in the Mediterranean.\n- **Actions**:\n    - Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs and stakeholders, including local governments and NGOs, to develop a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.\n    - Use this strategy as the foundation for launching the first **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** in the Mediterranean, a key resource for scaling regenerative projects.\n    - Establish financial support systems and capital distribution mechanisms to effectively fund ReFi Mediterranean initiatives.\n    - Expand the ReFi Toolkit, knowledge resources, and frameworks for ecosystem-wide adoption.\n\n# Thank you 💚\n\nOnly together can we build a regenerative future, for our bioregion and beyond.

Phangan activities:\n##Decentralized Cleanup Network Partnership:## ReFi Phangan and GreenPill Phangan have teamed up to conduct joint cleanup initiatives, working alongside the Decentralized Cleanup Network. These cleanups are a testament to our shared commitment to environmental stewardship and community engagement, removing significant amounts of waste from the island’s natural environments.\n##Onboarding Events and Workshops:## Together, we organize in-person onboarding events and workshops aimed at introducing the local community, NGOs, and individuals to web3 technologies and regenerative finance principles. These events are crucial in building a foundation of knowledge and engagement, fostering a community that is actively involved in sustainable practices.\nOur collaboration extends to supporting ReFi Phangan's Re:Plast  Phangan project, particularly by integrating it into a broader cryptoeconomics framework and aiding in fundraising efforts. This partnership not only strengthens our initiatives but also ensures that our collective impact is maximized.\n\nReFi Phangan: Towards a Sustainable Future through Regenerative Finance\nReFi Phangan's mission aligns seamlessly with GreenPill Phangan's vision, as both organizations are deeply committed to addressing environmental issues on Koh Phangan through innovative approaches. Our focus on community engagement, coupled with the adoption of web3 technologies, allows us to amplify our impact across various initiatives, including waste management and the establishment of a full-circle plastic recycling facility.\n##Cleanups and Environmental Initiatives:## ReFi Phangan aims to increase the frequency and scale of cleanup activities on Koh Phangan. This initiative will help reduce plastic pollution and prepare the population to follow important steps in plastic waste management, which are essential for succeeding with the next goal.\n\n\n##Re:Plast Recycling Facility:## Our epic goal is to benefit the environment of the entire island by organizing and providing the necessary support for the local government or village community to start running a dedicated recycling center for converting plastic waste into sustainable products based on the Precious Plastic program. This will build local recycling infrastructure, engage the community in recycling practices, and produce eco-friendly products that will become an additional source of income for the local economy.

These events are crucial in building a foundation of knowledge and engagement, fostering a community that is actively involved in sustainable practices.\nOur collaboration extends to supporting ReFi Phangan's Re:Plast  Phangan project, particularly by integrating it into a broader cryptoeconomics framework and aiding in fundraising efforts. This partnership not only strengthens our initiatives but also ensures that our collective impact is maximized.\n\nReFi Phangan: Towards a Sustainable Future through Regenerative Finance\nReFi Phangan's mission aligns seamlessly with GreenPill Phangan's vision, as both organizations are deeply committed to addressing environmental issues on Koh Phangan through innovative approaches. Our focus on community engagement, coupled with the adoption of web3 technologies, allows us to amplify our impact across various initiatives, including waste management and the establishment of a full-circle plastic recycling facility.\n##Cleanups and Environmental Initiatives:## ReFi Phangan aims to increase the frequency and scale of cleanup activities on Koh Phangan.

Rifai Sicilia: Regenerating Sicily's Bioregional Economy\n\n## Mission\n\nRifai Sicilia is a cultural association dedicated to regenerating Sicily's ecology by fostering a thriving bioregional economy. We unite regional projects and initiatives, leveraging culture and technology as transformative tools to revalue our territory. As part of the ReFi Italia family and ReFi DAO network we are working to develop best onchain regenerative practices in our local ecological context while learning and sharing with other nodes around the world.\n\n## Vision\n\nOur goal is to make Sicily a beacon for the Mediterranean and beyond, showcasing how regenerative bioregional cultures can flourish using blockchain technologies. Through our \"rebioregionaling\" process, we aim to reforest and rehydrate the landscape while restoring all eight forms of capital and integrating it into a healthy circular regenerative economy.\n\n## Key Initiatives\n\n- Syntropic Agroforestry\n- Permaculture Education and Training\n- Reforestation and Rainwater Retention\n- Wildfire Prevention and Trash Cleanup\n- River Health Monitoring \n- Seed Saving\n- Cultural Heritage Preservation\n- Agrotourism and Holistic Grazing\n- Local Farmers Markets\n- Mutual Credit Commitment Pooling\n- Web3 Education and Onboarding\n\n## Funding Priorities\n\n1.

We unite regional projects and initiatives, leveraging culture and technology as transformative tools to revalue our territory. As part of the ReFi Italia family and ReFi DAO network we are working to develop best onchain regenerative practices in our local ecological context while learning and sharing with other nodes around the world.\n\n## Vision\n\nOur goal is to make Sicily a beacon for the Mediterranean and beyond, showcasing how regenerative bioregional cultures can flourish using blockchain technologies. Through our \"rebioregionaling\" process, we aim to reforest and rehydrate the landscape while restoring all eight forms of capital and integrating it into a healthy circular regenerative economy.\n\n## Key Initiatives\n\n- Syntropic Agroforestry\n- Permaculture Education and Training\n- Reforestation and Rainwater Retention\n- Wildfire Prevention and Trash Cleanup\n- River Health Monitoring \n- Seed Saving\n- Cultural Heritage Preservation\n- Agrotourism and Holistic Grazing\n- Local Farmers Markets\n- Mutual Credit Commitment Pooling\n- Web3 Education and Onboarding\n\n## Funding Priorities\n\n1.
