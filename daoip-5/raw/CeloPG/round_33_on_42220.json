is a community-driven initiative founded in 2019, dedicated to regeneration and public welfare in harmony with nature. \nWe operate as a decentralized network of practitioners, researchers, farmers, and community members united by a shared commitment to Earth's regeneration. \nOur approach integrates indigenous wisdom with modern ecological practices, developing locally-adapted solutions with global relevance from our base in Turkiye.\n\n#### Mission: \nAfter years of witnessing the escalating metacrisis, we recognize the urgent need for proactive transformation. Our mission is to empower communities and build resilient ecosystems supported by data and accessible investment pathways.\nWe leverage DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) tools for decision-making in our ecological projects and help communities establish regenerative businesses, ecosystem health and local wellbeing. \nWe are working to incorporate innovative technologies like Ecocredit Modules, Hypercerts, and Impact Miner to provide the tools needed for creating regenerative economic models for a global shift toward regeneration.\n\n#### Our Key Projects\n\n**\"For the Earth\"**\nA comprehensive ecological education program fostering environmental awareness and action across communities. Through immersive learning experiences, we cultivate deep ecological literacy and connection.\n\n**\"Kendir Hemp\"**\nIn collaboration with Kendir Agricultural Research, this flagship project supports seed sovereignty by preserving heirloom hemp seeds. We're establishing a regenerative farm with hemp cultivation and a processing center to strengthen the hemp supply chain for small and family-run farms.\n\n**\"Regenerative Cotton Project\"**\nIn partnership with Hasat Cooperative and Raddis Cotton, we're transforming conventional cotton cultivation into regenerative systems. Through integrated practices including cover cropping, minimal tillage, and biological inputs, we rebuild soil health in fields traditionally depleted by conventional methods. Our participatory research with cotton farmers develops locally-adapted protocols that improve both yields and ecosystem function.\n\n**\"Rebioca\"**\nRebioca converts organic waste into regenerative resources through advanced composting and bioconversion techniques. This initiative creates significant value from previously discarded materials, establishing circular resource flows that mimic natural systems.\n\n**\"Istanbul Hub\"**\nThe Istanbul Hub connects farmers, researchers, and community members in developing regenerative strategies for urban and rural environments. This physical space serves as a living laboratory for ecological innovation, facilitating knowledge exchange between diverse stakeholders.\n\n**\"Orman İyeleri (Forest Schools)\"**\nOur Orman İyeleri program provides immersive ecological education that integrates indigenous wisdom with modern science. These forest schools cultivate a new generation of ecological practitioners who understand natural systems through direct experience.\n\n**\"Urban Gardening Programs\"**\nOur Urban Gardening Programs transform city spaces into productive food landscapes through community gardens, rooftop cultivation, and balcony growing systems. These initiatives reconnect urban residents with food production while creating habitat for pollinators and wildlife.\n\n**\"Web3 Education Programs\"**\nOur Web3 Education Programs develop digital tools for ecological tracking and transparent environmental restoration. These initiatives bridge technology and regenerative practices, creating accessible pathways for broader participation in ecosystem healing.\n\n---\n\n##### Recent progress and continued efforts in the past years(ongoing to previous);\n\n✅ Live on [$REGEN Validator](https://www.mintscan.io/regen/validators/regenvaloper1wexza7kxc8qktxqcwrt65anwuxjw8pg0akx36t) to support and secure the [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network) for decentralization, aiming to enhance global ecological decision-making.

Our mission is to empower communities and build resilient ecosystems supported by data and accessible investment pathways.\nWe leverage DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) tools for decision-making in our ecological projects and help communities establish regenerative businesses, ecosystem health and local wellbeing. \nWe are working to incorporate innovative technologies like Ecocredit Modules, Hypercerts, and Impact Miner to provide the tools needed for creating regenerative economic models for a global shift toward regeneration.\n\n#### Our Key Projects\n\n**\"For the Earth\"**\nA comprehensive ecological education program fostering environmental awareness and action across communities. Through immersive learning experiences, we cultivate deep ecological literacy and connection.\n\n**\"Kendir Hemp\"**\nIn collaboration with Kendir Agricultural Research, this flagship project supports seed sovereignty by preserving heirloom hemp seeds. We're establishing a regenerative farm with hemp cultivation and a processing center to strengthen the hemp supply chain for small and family-run farms.\n\n**\"Regenerative Cotton Project\"**\nIn partnership with Hasat Cooperative and Raddis Cotton, we're transforming conventional cotton cultivation into regenerative systems. Through integrated practices including cover cropping, minimal tillage, and biological inputs, we rebuild soil health in fields traditionally depleted by conventional methods. Our participatory research with cotton farmers develops locally-adapted protocols that improve both yields and ecosystem function.\n\n**\"Rebioca\"**\nRebioca converts organic waste into regenerative resources through advanced composting and bioconversion techniques. This initiative creates significant value from previously discarded materials, establishing circular resource flows that mimic natural systems.\n\n**\"Istanbul Hub\"**\nThe Istanbul Hub connects farmers, researchers, and community members in developing regenerative strategies for urban and rural environments. This physical space serves as a living laboratory for ecological innovation, facilitating knowledge exchange between diverse stakeholders.\n\n**\"Orman İyeleri (Forest Schools)\"**\nOur Orman İyeleri program provides immersive ecological education that integrates indigenous wisdom with modern science. These forest schools cultivate a new generation of ecological practitioners who understand natural systems through direct experience.\n\n**\"Urban Gardening Programs\"**\nOur Urban Gardening Programs transform city spaces into productive food landscapes through community gardens, rooftop cultivation, and balcony growing systems. These initiatives reconnect urban residents with food production while creating habitat for pollinators and wildlife.\n\n**\"Web3 Education Programs\"**\nOur Web3 Education Programs develop digital tools for ecological tracking and transparent environmental restoration. These initiatives bridge technology and regenerative practices, creating accessible pathways for broader participation in ecosystem healing.\n\n---\n\n##### Recent progress and continued efforts in the past years(ongoing to previous);\n\n✅ Live on [$REGEN Validator](https://www.mintscan.io/regen/validators/regenvaloper1wexza7kxc8qktxqcwrt65anwuxjw8pg0akx36t) to support and secure the [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network) for decentralization, aiming to enhance global ecological decision-making.

We’re creating a space where the elderly can thrive, refugees find opportunity, and the Salento community grows stronger.\n\nTraditional elder care often overlooks the bigger picture: community well-being and environmental health. Masseria Jabali changes that. By employing and training English speaking refugees, supporting local economies, and prioritizing regeneration, we deliver high-quality care for seniors with dementia while creating rural jobs in the  region. This isn’t just a care home—it’s a regenerators’ hub, fostering hope, connection, and renewal.\n\nWith your support, we’re taking this vision to the next level. Funds from this round will refine our strategy and spark community engagement, proving that elder care can be a catalyst for broader good.\n\n---\n\n### What We’re Building\n\nMasseria Jabali combines rustic Italian charm with purpose:  \n- **Care with Dignity**: Private rooms and 24/7 personalized support for seniors with dementia, including medication reminders, meal assistance, and a clean, safe environment—because they can’t live unsupervised anymore.  \n- **Social Impact**: Jobs and training for refugees, integrating them into the workforce and enriching our community with diverse perspectives.  \n- **Ecological Renewal**: Solar power, water recycling, and fresh food from our syntropic farm.  \n- **Local Boost**: Engagement with Salento’s farmers, artisans, and businesses to rivitalize the regional economy.  \n\nOur current working business plan is live [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsvW0A00MakukiSitNEbvnUMku3SYY9uX56jQkBvwsI/edit?usp=sharing)—a foundation we’re ready to polish and expand.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nElder care can do more than meet basic needs—it can regenerate communities and landscapes. Too often, facilities focus solely on profit or bare-minimum services, ignoring the potential for wider impact. We see a different path: a retreat that heals people *and* places. By weaving together senior care, refugee empowerment, and green practices, we’re testing a model that others can follow.  \n\nThis funding round is our chance to prove it works—and share the blueprint with Salento’s regenerators.\n\n---\n\n### How We’ll Use the Funds\n\nWe’re not just dreaming big—we’re planning smart. Here’s how we’ll put your contributions to work over the next few months:\n\n#### Phase 1: Refine the Vision (Business Plan Development)  \n- **Goal**: Create a polished, submittable business plan to unlock EU and regional grants for Masseria Jabali’s growth.  \n- **What We’ll Do**:  \n  - Hire experts in grant writing and elder care policy to enhance our [current plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsvW0A00MakukiSitNEbvnUMku3SYY9uX56jQkBvwsI/edit?usp=sharing).  \n  - Add detailed financial projections, impact metrics (e.g., jobs created, carbon reduced), and a roadmap for scaling our refugee integration and sustainability efforts.  \n  - Tailor the plan to specific EU programs (e.g., Horizon Europe, Puglia Regional Development Funds) with clear eligibility criteria met.  \n- **Outcome**: A professional, grant-ready document that secures funding to build out our retreat and amplify its impact.\n\n#### Phase 2: Engage the Community (Lecce Event)  \n- **Goal**: Host a 1-day event in Lecce, Italy, for 20–35 locals passionate about regeneration, teaching them how to turn ideas into funded projects.  \n- **Format**:  \n  - **Morning Session**: “Imagining Regeneration in Salento”  \n    - Interactive discussion led by Masseria Jabali founders on what renewal looks like—restored land, thriving communities, and inclusive economies.  \n    - Guest speakers: a representative of [GUS](https://www.gus-italia.org/).  \n  - **Afternoon Workshop**: “Writing a Winning Business Plan”  \n    - Hands-on training with grant experts on crafting professional plans for EU and regional funding.  \n    - Focus on practical steps: defining goals, budgeting, and measuring impact.  \n    - Participants draft mini-plans for their own regeneration ideas (e.g., eco-tourism, community gardens).  \n  - **Evening Wrap-Up**: Networking dinner with attendees, speakers, and Masseria Jabali staff to build a regenerators’ network.  \n- **Outcome**: Empowered locals with the tools to launch their own projects, plus a stronger community connection to Masseria Jabali’s mission.\n\n---\n\n### Key Deliverables\n\n1. **A Robust Business Plan**:  \n   - A comprehensive, grant-eligible document ready for EU and regional submissions by August 2025.  \n   - Includes detailed strategies for elder care, refugee integration, and ecological goals, backed by data and stakeholder input.  \n\n2. **A Community Event**:  \n   - A successful Lecce gathering with 20–35 attendees, sparking regeneration ideas and equipping participants with business planning skills.  \n   - Follow-up report shared with Gitcoin backers: attendance stats, participant feedback, and next steps for Salento’s regenerators.\n\n---\n\n### Why Back Us?\n\nWe’re showing how elder care can lift up overlooked groups, heal the environment, and inspire a region. Your support doesn’t just fund a retreat center for the elderly; it fuels a ripple effect of good.  \n\n- **For Seniors**: A tangible solution to the elderly care crisis;\n- **For Refugees**: A tangible solution to the refugee integration crisis happening throughout Europe.\n- **For Salento**:    ~ One organization with the potential to create hundreds of caretakers that will work in the region and lead stable lives with healthcare professions.\n   ~ For the abandoned ulivetti and vineyards of Salento that need TLC to adapt for the desertification of the Mediterannean brought upon by climate change.\n- **For You**: A chance to back a Web3-aligned vision where impact meets innovation.\n\n---\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nThis is our first step toward a replicable model. A refined business plan and a community event will unlock grants for land purchasing to fully build Masseria Jabali—then we’ll share our learnings. Imagine similar retreats across Europe, each a hub of care and regeneration. That’s the protopian future we’re hacking toward, one Puglia sunrise at a time.\n\n---\n\n### Fine Print\n\n- **Timeline**: 3–6 months from funding to deliverables (plan by month 3, event by month 6).  \n- **Who We Need**: Backers who care about social impact, sustainability, and community-driven solutions. This isn’t a quick flip—it’s a thoughtful build.  \n- **Contact**: @regenagvocate on Twitter or check our informational website (coming soon) @

Forest creates 1,000 forest sanctuaries through art and biodiversity stewarded by local communities and protected for 1,000 years. \nThe project supports communities to restore and protect

Italia is a network-driven initiative dedicated to tackle ecological and social challenges through innovative technology and grassroots initiatives. Over the past few years, we've focused on building the foundational infrastructure for regenerative development across Italian bioregions. Our vision for 2025 and beyond is to amplify our achievements through focused education, strategic network expansion, and tangible ecological restoration projects, creating a blueprint for similar Mediterranean regions.  \n  \n# Focus areas  \n  \n## Education and Outreach  \n  \nWe work to raise awareness about regenerative practices, blockchain technology, and community-led development. By educating diverse audiences, we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities shaping Italy’s ecosystems.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_\n- Hosted two online workshops on mutual credit protocols, featuring [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) and [Cycles.money](https://x.com/cyclesmoney).  \n- Led an in-person training session on commitment pooling during [Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) Week.  \n- Participated in key Italian web3 events, including [ETHNA](https://x.com/ethna_rocks), [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome), [Digitalia Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsXeGs-cJs&ab_channel=UrbeETH), and [Apical Days Palermo](https://www.instagram.com/apical_org/p/DBi5QpLsUyd/).  \n  \n## Community Empowerment  \n  \nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration.

Over the past few years, we've focused on building the foundational infrastructure for regenerative development across Italian bioregions. Our vision for 2025 and beyond is to amplify our achievements through focused education, strategic network expansion, and tangible ecological restoration projects, creating a blueprint for similar Mediterranean regions.  \n  \n# Focus areas  \n  \n## Education and Outreach  \n  \nWe work to raise awareness about regenerative practices, blockchain technology, and community-led development. By educating diverse audiences, we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities shaping Italy’s ecosystems.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_\n- Hosted two online workshops on mutual credit protocols, featuring [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) and [Cycles.money](https://x.com/cyclesmoney).  \n- Led an in-person training session on commitment pooling during [Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) Week.  \n- Participated in key Italian web3 events, including [ETHNA](https://x.com/ethna_rocks), [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome), [Digitalia Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsXeGs-cJs&ab_channel=UrbeETH), and [Apical Days Palermo](https://www.instagram.com/apical_org/p/DBi5QpLsUyd/).  \n  \n## Community Empowerment  \n  \nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration.

**A Local Node as a Rooted Cooperative  🌱**\n\n[**ReFi Barcelona**](https://refibcn.cat/Home_CAT) is a local node within the global [**ReFi movement**](https://refibcn.cat/Ecosystem+Map/Global+-+ReFi+and+Web3/ReFi+Ecosystem), focused on connecting **regenerative finance, local regenerators and the Social & Solidarity Economy (ESS)** in Barcelona and across Catalonia - to drive forward the so called **[ecosocial transition](https://www.bcn.coop/transicio-ecosocial/).**\n\nWe’re also part of a broader bioregional effort through [**ReFi Mediterranean**](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/refi-mediterranean-gg23), where we collaborate with other nodes across the bioregion to scale regenerative strategies and funding mechanisms for regenerative work.\n\n> We serve as a bridge between global Web3 infrastructure and place-based economic transformation.\n> \n\n### Our Approach: Building Hybrid Systems Through Cooperative Structures **🌍**\n\nReFi Barcelona is a **proof of concept** for building regenerative systems that are both **technologically innovative and socially grounded**.\n\nWe believe that to regenerate economies, we need **hybrid infrastructures** that:\n\n- **Leverage Web3** for transparency, coordination, and composability; as well as for opening opportunities for funding and support\n- **Integrate cooperative models** for human-scale governance and economic justice\n- **Learn from local territories**, while staying globally connected\n\n### Our plan: Growing from the roots of
