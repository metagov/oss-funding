    "description": "dApp Development on Celo: Ecofrontiers is actively developing the Regen Atlas, a location-based platform intended for deployment on the Celo Network. This dApp aims to provide a global, open-source platform to facilitate the discovery, funding, and creation of tokenized green assets. The Regen Atlas team recently received a Prezenti grant to support the UX/UI development of the interface, and enable direct buying of the assets on Celo.\n\nResearch Supporting Celo: Ecofrontiers has engaged in research efforts that support and advocate for the Celo ecosystem. A notable example is the release of chapters from the Green Crypto Handbook, which provides insights into how environmental finance can be structured within a Web3 context. Of note is that the two authors of the Green Crypto Handbook also wrote in the past core research and documentation for the Kolektivo Framework, a key project of the Celo ecosystem.",
