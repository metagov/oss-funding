We're proposing to replace that with a Cubid humanity score threshold to determine applicant eligibility. This change unlocks the ability to:\n\nAutomate eligibility checks\nSupport self-service onboarding\nReward users with deeper web3 identity graphs\nTie into existing Cubid integrations across the ecosystem\n\nOptimistic approvals will be granted to anyone who meets the application criteria and exceeds the Cubid score threshold. Applications can be vetoed by a designated admin (Steve) if necessary.\n\nBrightID can still potentially be still used as a soft requirement in parallel with Cubid, or as a second layer prior to distributing a grant, but should not be the first requirement as it is not fully self-serve nor permissionless. \nPhase 2: Add DAO Oversight for Veto Power and Legitimacy\nWhile applications will be optimistically approved, a lightweight governance layer will be added in Phase 2:\n\nUse the GoodDAO (or a separate microDAO) to review incoming applications\nAllow DAO members to flag or veto bad actors or ineligible submissions\nOptionally, introduce snapshot-based voting or Cubid-weighted governance for future iterations\n\nThis adds credibility, trust, and decentralization without bottlenecking the flow of funds.\nPhase 3: Rebuild as a Light dApp with an Indexer\nThe existing GoodMicrogrants site will be rebuilt into a lightweight dApp that includes:\n\nWallet connect and Rainbow kit for login\nOn-chain application submissions\nLive display of past winners and funded projects\nIndexer integration for programmatic view of who sold what, when, and for how much\nBasic analytics (e.g. average grant size, total funds distributed)\nOptional integration of quadratic matching logic either via a spreadsheet feed or built-in calculation\n\nAn indexer will be developed to:\n\nTrack GoodDollar spending activity related to sales of goods or services\nPrepare structured data for each round\nReduce reliance on manual spreadsheet tracking\n\nThis makes the program scalable, transparent, and compatible with future automation layers.\n4. Integrate with Marketplaces for Direct Grants\nWhere possible, microgrants will be distributed based on verified GoodDollar sales processed through:\n\nMarketplaces where payments are tracked on-chain\nClassifieds platforms that natively accept and record GoodDollar transactions\n\nThis removes the need for manual applications altogether in some cases. Sellers who use online marketplace platforms without on-chain payments will still be able to apply manually through the dApp, provided they meet the Cubid score threshold.\n5. Add Community-Funding Mechanisms\nTo increase funding and sustainability, the program will be supplemented by:\n\nOptional daily claim opt-ins (users can donate a portion of their daily G$)\nMatching fund contributions from aligned DAOs and protocols\nDirect donations from the community\nCampaigns to bring ecosystem partners into the funding flow",

Using a unique \"field-based\" design philosophy and intelligent AI agents, we cultivate digital environments where meaningful relationships flourish and collaborative creation thrives.  Our core function is service: enabling members to find each other, navigate the \"meaning economy,\" develop their unique gifts, and work together effectively. To achieve this, Liminal Commons requires a native, value-aligned currency. GoodDollar (G$) is that currency. We will integrate G$ as the lifeblood of our internal ecosystem for:  Distributing Grants: Directly funding projects and individuals within the network. Powering Micro-transactions: Rewarding participation, enabling tipping, and facilitating access. Facilitating Value Exchange: Experimenting with gift, commons-based, and contribution economies.  By integrating G$, Liminal Commons provides a crucial new dimension of utility for the token \u2013 moving beyond basic needs into supporting transformation, collaboration, and purpose.

This integration will leverage zero-knowledge proofs to verify human uniqueness without compromising user privacy, significantly enhancing trust in our platform's voting results while maintaining a seamless user experience. The G$ Identity verification aligns perfectly with our mission of creating truly democratic funding mechanisms where communities can make collective decisions with confidence that each vote represents a genuine human perspective, ultimately ensuring resources flow to the most valued initiatives without manipulation or disproportionate influence from any single participant.",

This feature will be especially valuable for campaigns with significant voting power or funding amounts.\n\nConfigurable Verification Thresholds: Admins can set different verification requirements based on vote multiplier levels - for example, requiring G$ Identity verification only for votes with 3x multiplier or higher, ensuring that high-impact votes come from verified unique humans.\n\nSmart Contract Integration: We'll extend our campaign creation contracts to include optional verification flags that, when enabled, require validated G$ Identity proofs for specific voting actions.\n\nEnhanced Voting Flow for Verified Campaigns:\n\nUser connects wallet to Sovereign Seas\n\nUser selects desired vote multiplier\n\nIf multiplier exceeds admin-defined threshold AND verification is enabled for the campaign, user is prompted to complete G$ Identity verification\n\nUpon successful verification, user receives a credential token\n\nWhen voting, this credential is cryptographically verified without exposing personal data\n\nSmart contract validates the credential before processing high-multiplier votes\n\nTechnical Components\n\nAdmin Configuration Panel: Add G$ Identity verification toggles and threshold settings to the campaign creation interface\n\nFrontend Integration: Incorporate the G$ Identity SDK conditionally based on campaign settings and vote multiplier selections\n\nSmart Contract Enhancements: Extend campaign creation parameters to include verification requirements flags\n\nConditional Verification Logic: Build logic that applies G$ Identity verification only when required by campaign settings\n\nZero-Knowledge Proof Handling: Implement cryptographic verification of G$ Identity proofs without storing sensitive user data\n\nImplementation Timeline\n\nPhase 1 (Weeks 1-2)\n\nSet up development environment with G$ Identity SDK\n\nExtend campaign creation interface with verification option toggles\n\nDesign conditional verification architecture\n\nPhase 2 (Weeks 3-4)\n\nFrontend integration of verification components and admin controls\n\nImplementation of conditional verification logic\n\nUpdate smart contracts to include verification flag parameters\n\nPhase 3 (Weeks 5-6)\n\nComplete smart contract modifications for conditional verification\n\nIntegration testing with G$ Identity system\n\nTesting of different campaign configurations and thresholds\n\nPhase 4 (Weeks 7-8)\n\nTestnet deployment with complete G$ Identity integration\n\nAdmin panel testing with various configuration scenarios\n\nFeedback collection from campaign creators\n\nPhase 5 (Weeks 9-10)\n\nSecurity review and performance optimization\n\nMainnet deployment of G$ Identity-enhanced voting system\n\nDocumentation for campaign admins on when to enable verification",

Our strategy to drive adoption and G$ utility includes the following:\n\n1. Incentivized Identity Building\nWe\u2019ll promote the GoodDollar stamp as a key credential within Cubid\u2019s identity graph\u2014used to:\n\nIncrease a user\u2019s humanity score\n\nUnlock access to DAO governance, gated communities, and impact-based apps\n\nEnhance Sybil resistance for users participating in web3 platforms\n\nThe more stamps a user has, the more valuable their Cubid Passport becomes\u2014creating a natural incentive to complete GoodDollar face verification and earn the stamp.\n\n2. Embedded in Onboarding Flows\nFor new users creating a Cubid Passport, the G$ verification stamp will be featured as a recommended action in the onboarding checklist. This drives consistent visibility and encourages organic adoption early in the user journey.\n\n3. Cross-Ecosystem Integration\nWe\u2019re actively integrating Cubid with other dApps and communities that can leverage the G$ stamp as a credential\u2014for example:\n\nGated access to DeFi or governance tools\n\nReputation scoring for task or bounty platforms\n\nSybil protection in community voting\n\nThis encourages users from other apps to verify via GoodDollar in order to participate more fully.\n\n4. Composability with Future Use Cases\nAs Cubid expands, the G$ verification stamp can be used in new ways\u2014such as:\n\nProof of uniqueness for identity-based rewards\n\nEligibility criteria for microgrants and public goods programs\n\nWeighting in governance based on verified identity\n\n5. Social Proof & Visibility\nPublic profiles in Cubid display user stamps by default. The GoodDollar verification stamp will be visually distinct and featured as a signal of real, verified identity\u2014encouraging social proof and driving peer adoption.",

Cubid provides the infrastructure to represent and compose decentralized identity, while GoodDollar contributes a powerful biometric verification layer. Together, they help establish a more Sybil-resistant, human-first web3.\n\nThe most interesting use case for this integration lies in the opportunities it opens up for new and groundbreaking uses. For example:\n- Targeted UBI for users in a particular area by leveraging Cubid\u2019s geogating capabilities based on device geolocation, phone number, passport, drivers license info, Discord/Telegram/Farcaster group memberships and more. GoodDollar could for example enable a targeted UBI campaign for a war-torn country or disaster-struck area.\n- Provision \u201cbonus GoodDollars\u201d to people who opt in to a stronger identity verification with Cubid\n- Use quadratic- or conviction-based voting power in the GoodDAO.\n- Enable the Daily Claim Button on any web2 website by leveraging Cubid\u2019s non-custodial embedded wallet functionality (see separate grant application for more details).\n\nWhile specific user growth projections are not available at this stage, we expect significant interest from users looking to strengthen their Cubid profiles with verified identity signals. All stamps\u2014including the Verified with GoodDollar stamp\u2014contribute to Cubid\u2019s broader humanity scoring system, which supports use cases like Sybil resistance, DAO participation, and access control across decentralized applications.",

This integration expands $G utility from a basic UBI or spendable token into a **long-term savings vehicle**, encouraging users to treat G$ as a tool not only for daily expenses but for future planning.  **Key benefits for G$ adoption:**  - **New use case:** Introduces goal-based crypto saving for G$ holders. - **Wider exposure:** Bitsave users will be encouraged to save in G$, increasing awareness and adoption. - **Financial empowerment:** Especially for users in emerging markets, saving in G$ helps them escape inflation and build stability.  With this integration, G$ becomes more than a basic income token\u2014it becomes a **savings safety net**.",

Our architecture uses a **Parent-Child contract model**, where each user gets a personal savings contract tied directly to their wallet. This structure ensures funds remain non-custodial, secure, and private.\n\nTo integrate **GoodDollar ($G)** as a savings token, we will:\n\n---\n\n**1. Token Integration:**\n\n- Add $G token support to our contract interface as a valid deposit asset\n- Enable $G selection as a preferred stable token when creating savings plans\n\n**2. Savings Plan Logic Extension:**\n\n- Modify contract logic to support interest-free tokens like $G\n- Implement seamless $G balance handling for recurring deposits, withdrawals, and penalties\n\n**3. $G Smart Contract Interaction:**\n\n- Ensure compliance with $G staking and withdrawal standards\n- Explore integration with GoodStaking or GoodReserve contracts for additional features, pending $G team guidance.\n\n**4. UI/UX Update:**\n\n- Add $G balance display, plan creation, and savings goal tracking\n- Integrate with wallets (like Fuse + GoodDollar) for seamless onboarding of existing $G users\n\n**5. Testing and Audit:**\n\n- Deploy and test $G support with the community.\n- Submit implementation for $G community review and third-party audit\n1. Marketing:\nRun Merch campaigns for saving on $G\nCarryout info educative marketing activities for $G savings\n\n---\n\n**Timeline Estimate for Integration (2\u20133 weeks):**\n\n- Week 1: Smart contract modifications and front-end integration\n- Week 2: Testing and quality assurance\n- Week 3: Launch user onboarding campaign and awareness initiatives",
