“As COVID-19 still devastates families around the world, remittances continue to provide a critical lifeline for the poor and vulnerable.” - Michal Rutkowski, Global Director of the Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice at the World Bank.

Defying predictions, the World Bank reports that global remittance flows have proved to be resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020, officially recorded remittance flows to low-and-middle-income countries reached $540 billion, only 1.6 percent below the $548 billion seen in 2019.

With an increased desire for migrants to support their families back home and the economic conditions in host countries proving favourable (e.g. stimulus packages), paired with shifts in flows from informal to formal channels (from hand-carry cash to digital remittances), the flow of global remittances to low-and-middle-income countries is expected to reach $565 billion by 2022.

CHALLENGES

The tiny archipelago nations in the South Pacific are often overlooked or deprioritized when it comes to expediting tangible, achievable solutions to real-world and sometimes life-threatening problems.

As we enter an age of rapid acceleration and transformation, Fijians and Pacific Islanders who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of adverse macro and micro economic conditions are left behind.

The people of the Pacific rely heavily on remittances and there has been very little improvement from service providers, to help reduce the cost of transactions and to meet UN SDGs.

THE SOLUTION

Built on the Stellar network, we would like to develop a new pathway for remittances into the South Pacific. A pathway that removes the need for traditional intermediaries and one that gives frictionless access to global financial systems to those who are often forgotten. We call it FijiCoin (working title).

FijiCoin will be a FIAT-collateralized stablecoin, pegged against the Fijian Dollar.

We will play the role of asset issuer, anchor and wallet to help facilitate transactions, manage reserves and the necessary compliance in each relevant jurisdiction. We will also play a leading role in introducing on/off-ramps into Fiji and the South Pacific.

We are in discussions with the Reserve Bank of Fiji (Central Bank) and have made a submission to their FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. They will be a key stakeholder in allowing us to tokenize the Fijian FIAT and help guide us with regulatory and compliance requirements for FX controls, monetary policy, transparency and security.

By removing the traditional barriers of sending and receiving remittances to loved ones, our aim is to help fight poverty through enhanced financial inclusion and to improve the lives and livelihoods of Fijians and South Pacific Islanders.",,,https://www.mai.money/,,https://vimeo.com/594633494,,,,,,,"Rush, Rush ",,,,,
Ebioro,SCF #8,OrunPay,Ebioro,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recsWgGMe0r36Gza0,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$236763.00,$239164.32,863783.29,9/30/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,Financial Freedom for all Cubans,"OrunPay’s mission to provide financial freedom to all Cubans was borne out of frustration over their lack of autonomy to make financial decisions. Financial independence is particularly relevant today, where a choked Cuban economy, made worse by government mismanagement, stringent US sanctions and a serious decline in tourism brought on by the Covid 19 pandemic, is driving the need for fresh funds to reach the hands of the Cuban people. This is pushing Cubans to find innovative solutions to send and receive payments, as well as to manage their personal finances.

Cubans’ lack of financial autonomy is the result of several factors, including an undeveloped financial infrastructure (i.e. payment services, investment options, borrowing capabilities, etc.), a strong internal focus on Cuban government-led businesses and financial institutions, and US sanctions which stifle the Cuban economy’s access to external markets. The US Embargo has blocked all US companies from working with Cuba, but this has also had a serious chilling effect on non-US entities as well. While non-US companies are allowed to work in Cuba, many do not out of fear of direct or indirect US reprimand. For example, the vast majority of European banks refuse to deal in any way with Cuban transactions, even when fully compliant with all rules, as a result of heavy fines imposed on several European banks because of their Cuban dealings. Consequently, many fully owned European companies, that are by law authorized to conduct business with Cuba, cannot make payments to their Cuban counterparties because their European banks will not authorize the transactions. The same happens for payment flows exiting Cuba because the receiving banks will not accept the payments. Ironically, this chilling effect has also harshly affected the Cuban private sector despite the intention of the US sanctions legislation to encourage its growth. Instead, most Cuban merchants and small businesses cannot accept credit card payments for products/services they wish to sell online or at a point of sale because credit card processing companies will not onboard Cuban customers.

The strong internal focus by the Cuban government on its government-led businesses also means that the foreign capital that does manage to enter Cuba through foreign investment is usually managed by other entities linked to the Cuban government, rather than by the foreign investors bringing the money in. Similarly, Cuban companies who have operations outside of Cuba face the same issue when entering foreign capital into Cuba. For both these types of companies, access to their funds is essentially given to them based on a hierarchical structure decided by Cuban government-affiliated entities. Even remittances, the largest source of income and a lifeline for many Cuban individuals, is first received by Cuban authorities before being distributed to individuals in local currency.

Throughout the years, Cubans have developed a deep mistrust towards their and government institutions and national currency, due to government mismanagement and currency devaluation as a result of many periods of economic uncertainty. Cuba is currently experiencing a drastic devaluation because of difficulties faced by the Cuban government in unifying the Cuban Peso (the official currency) with an alternative currency that has been circulating in parallel since 1994.

All of these issues have largely isolated Cuba from the world overtime, severely affecting its economic development and the financial options of its population. What remains is a chaotic, expensive and highly inefficient way of dealing with day-to-day finances for everyday Cubans and businesses. There is therefore a great need to provide a comprehensive solution that equips Cubans with the financial independence that they need.

OrunPay is developing a payment platform that places autonomy back into the hands of Cuban nationals and companies. Our solution is outside of any government control and allows Cuban individuals and companies to send and receive payments in a variety of different currencies. Additionally, Cuban nationals will have a lower level of exposure to currency devaluations because it will be possible for them to store their money in foreign-denominated stablecoins, outside the control of Cuban government financial institutions. This will all be done in a compliant manner and is what we hope to be the first step in the broader digitalization of the Cuban economy.",,,https://ebioro.com/,,https://vimeo.com/594326811,,,,,,,Yulexi Matienzo,,,,,

Tellus Cooperative,SCF #8,Tellus Cooperative,Tellus Cooperative,Education & Community,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recNO4RNaF9ack4Kq,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$29500.00,$29500.00,107624.95,9/29/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,Be cooperative.,"Tellus Cooperative will create an Application Programming Interface (API) that connects Merchant Services Provider (MSP) to Anchor Asset Issuers using Turing Complete Signing Servers (TSS). Doing this, we will be able to reach out to a massive amount of users already participating in the gig economy either as customers, merchants, or workers. We believe that MSPs have tremendous untapped potential. By taking advantage of their existing credit flow logic and incorporating Stellar Smart Contracts at the heart of their payment gateways, we can create a seamless transition to Decentralized Finance Protocols. MSPs' merchants, customers, and workers will be the most benefited from this adoption wave. The API will facilitate the creation of Stellar accounts by deploying stored smart contracts on a TSS Network run by individual MSPs' merchants. This will ensure trustless transactions within a closed ecosystem.

We will implement a tip pool protocol leveraged by anchored assets. This will generate liquidity to strengthen national stablecoins and incentivize adoption through crypto savings and rewards. Tellus will release a utility token to the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX), aiming to serve as a bridge between anchored assets, lumens, Stellar tokens, and the cryptocurrency market itself. This Token will serve as a medium to measure our protocol performance and as a store of value to reward the protocol's participants.

We want to work directly with anchors to incorporate local currencies into everyday transactions. Our API will connect app services and anchor providers to take full advantage of bank-backed assets. This way, merchants will be able to ""stake"" a percentage of their earnings into local anchored tokens. A process similar to when an app service charges you an internal fee. This layer of service will utilize Turing Complete Signing Turrets (TSS) which will store, deploy, and sign Stellar Smart Contracts (SCC) to the blockchain. These funds will ultimately be sent to a tip pool and shared equitably. This works similarly to a mutual fund, only contributing participants will have access to these pools. For example: If 3 restaurants working with an app delivery service send money to a pool, they and only they will have access to these assets. Stellar Multi-Signature operations are the perfect way to achieve this, the functionality to provide different weights to different account holders is advantageous when transacting in shared accounts. Their tip pools will have certain sizes. These will be geometrically proportional to the Merchant Services Provider (MSP) accumulated earnings and will be calculated within the same TSS network and updated in the blockchain periodically. These size limits will create an organization system within tip pools. When a pool gets filled up - or reaches its limit, no new participants will be allowed in it, and a brand new pool will be created to accommodate the new participants in the protocol. The pool members will have full ownership control over the assets, they will be able to transact with other members of the pool, and be rewarded with Tellus Tokens by cooperating and maintaining the protocol's integrity.

Parameters will be automatically designed by averaging MSP's performance. We will conduct local market research to gather information about their profitability, sales, and competition. We will use this data to create a series of forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Time Series, Autoregression) and compare it to Tellus Ecosystem's expected growth rates. This way, we will be able to fine-tune weights to achieve the best profitability margins that will ultimately determine the size and behavior of the merchant tip pools. At the same time, we will use the Tellus Token to reward and incentivize account holders using MSP's apps. Instead of driving demand using reward systems like coupons, cashback, or sales, we will simply “gift” Tellus Tokens to end users and workers alike. This model improves upon existing cashback and customer retention strategies. We give the rewardee an opportunity to use our tokens on the same MSP environment, with API affiliates, or simply exchange them for other assets in the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX). The amount to be awarded will vary depending on the role of the user in the ecosystem. As mentioned before, merchants will be rewarded by leveraging their anchored assets in Tellus's Tip Pools. MSP's Customers will be rewarded depending on their activity - purchase habits (cashback), social interactions, or airdrops. MSP's Workers will be rewarded by profitability margins within the tip pools, this way, the same workers that help maintain the integrity of the service, will be rewarded by its growth, adding a layer of participatory democracy to our protocol.

The reason behind this economic model is to enable everyday people to be a part of something great. As individuals, we have the collective power to change the world. Cooperation will be what changes it.

While entertaining the implications of an economic model like Tellus', we developed a food delivery app to incorporate our system. Vajom Delivery is an application designed to evaluate, test, and improve the foundations for Tellus Cooperative. Its main goal is to foment restaurants and gig workers alike by using Tellus's Protocol. As a team, we realized that a great deal of small businesses lacked the market size to attract Merchant Services Providers. Villarrica, Chile, a tourist town in the heart of the south, has more than 70 food establishments with no delivery service available. One of the observed factors for MSPs' behavior is the seasonality of the market, and therefore a greater risk. As we kept researching Villarrica's market conditions, we were able to draw unprecedented parallels to other towns in Chile. The incorporation of a service like Vajom in Villarrica would create new jobs and more business for locals. Yet, a food delivery app like every other will face the same problems that major MSPs consider when expanding their business. Hence, we decided to create the app and use it as a testing environment for Tellus' Cooperative.

The platform consists of 4 applications built using AngularJS and the Ionic Framework: Vajom Delivery - for customers, Vajom Local - for merchants, Vajom Repartidor - for delivery drivers, Vajom Admin - for overseeing the application's performance.

We want to make Vajom open source. We believe that having a testing platform to implement our advances with Tellus is a great way to connect with the Stellar Community. At the same time, this will allow us to review possible pitfalls within the protocol and get input on improving its functionality. We envision Vajom in the future as a fully automatic system with no central ownership, where all merchants and delivery drivers are the owners themselves of the platform. We are certain that as we improve Tellus' relationships and codebase, Vajom will be able to shine and grow on its own.",,,https://telluscoop.com,,https://vimeo.com/594342417,,,,,,,Bastian Alexander Koh Cuende,,Tellus Cooperative,@telluscoop,https://discord.gg/ysuxyKJ34c,
