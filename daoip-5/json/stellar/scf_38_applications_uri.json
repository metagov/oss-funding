This will:\n\n-   Normalize USDC/NGNC as modern retail currencies.\n    \n-   Attract forward-thinking merchants and crypto-native consumers.\n    \n-   Position Cartwey as a leading gateway for real-world stablecoin adoption.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Sollpay will integrate Stellar into its keyless wallet infrastructure through three major upgrades that enable seamless crypto payments, programmable identity, and cross-chain investing:\n\n1) Stellar Payment Rail Integration\n\nWe will implement native Stellar USDC support within Sollpay’s abstract account wallet. Using Stellar’s low-fee, high-speed infrastructure, users will be able to send and receive crypto assets using phone numbers or email addresses, without seed phrases or public keys. This lowers the barrier for onboarding non-crypto-native users, especially in mobile-first regions.\n\n2) Cross-Chain Swap Access Between Stellar And Solana\n\nSollpay will provide opportunities to Solana’s 32M+ wallet users and 4.8M+ daily actives into the Stellar network by enabling them to seamlessly access Stellar-based assets and payment rails using a single keyless wallet. Through embedded swap bridges, Solana users will convert tokens like SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC directly within the app, enabling real-world spending, remittances, and investment on Stellar. This flow positions Stellar as a destination layer for global users coming from high-velocity DeFi environments, while abstracting away key management and wallet friction through Sollpay’s infrastructure.\n\n3)ZK-Based Identity Abstraction with Stellar Accounts\n\nWe will extend our zero-knowledge authentication layer to support Stellar accounts, enabling users to generate secure, non-custodial wallets without manual key management. Stellar accounts will be instantiated and linked through AA+ZK logic, allowing compliant and secure identity abstraction while maintaining user privacy and custody. This bridges the gap between usability and security in the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nBy embedding Stellar deeply into Sollpay’s technical stack, we’re not just adding a chain — we’re extending Stellar’s reach into a mobile-first, identity-native, and cross-chain financial layer, unlocking new use cases like contact-based payments, Web3 investing, and frictionless staking for users around the world.",

With Sollpay’s keyless wallet, users can convert SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC in a single tap, making Stellar a destination layer for real-world spending, stablecoin usage, and digital payments.\n\nCross-Chain Ecosystem Partnerships\n\nThrough integrations with leading Solana protocols (e.g. Jito for staking, Jupiter for swaps), Sollpay will offer high-value Stellar onramps to a DeFi-native audience. These features will be delivered within our user-centric wallet interface, abstracting away seed phrases and complex bridging, and accelerating Stellar exposure across cross-chain communities.\n\nCommunity Activation & Brand Visibility\n\nAs a member of Solana Superteam and a portfolio company of both the Binance France Web3 Accelerator and the HEC Incubator at Station F, Sollpay will leverage its strong presence in the European Web3 ecosystem to run demo campaigns, education workshops, and user onboarding events focused on GenZ and mobile-first users entering the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nProduct-Led Growth Strategy\n\nBy combining contact-based transfers, seedless account creation, and xStock investing into a single mobile-native interface, Sollpay lowers the entry barrier to on-chain finance. This positions Stellar as a gateway to real-world payments and investing, while enabling a Web2-friendly, secure, and scalable experience from day one.",

Adoption Metrics\n\n-   5,000+ mid-level farmers onboarded with verified Stellar NGNC wallets within 12 months of mainnet launch.\n    \n-   50+ processors and aggregators actively logging product lifecycles and receiving instant NGNC settlements.\n    \n-   10+ export buyers/importers transacting through AgTrail’s pay-per-trace and verification modules.\n    \n-   500+ traceable product batches registered with QR-linked, Stellar-anchored certifications.\n    \n\n2. Farmer Impact\n\n-   Farmers achieve a 20–30% income uplift by gaining access to premium EU/FDA-compliant markets.\n    \n-   15% reduction in post-harvest losses via IoT monitoring of temperature, moisture, and logistics data, ensuring better preservation and quality.\n    \n-   Immediate settlement in NGNC eliminates reliance on middlemen, reducing payment delays from weeks to seconds.\n    \n\n3. Exporter & Regulator Efficiency\n\n-   Exporters save up to 40% in compliance costs by replacing manual traceability reports with automated, Stellar-anchored certifications.\n    \n-   Regulators access real-time dashboards that flag anomalies, ensuring higher food safety standards at lower oversight cost.\n    \n-   Importers gain verifiable transparency on 200+ shipments, strengthening trust in Nigerian produce.\n    \n\n4. Financial Inclusion & Ecosystem Impact\n\n-   First-time access to digital wallets for thousands of rural farmers, with Beans-App providing seamless NGNC↔Naira conversion for non-crypto users.\n    \n-   Micro-loans and trade finance unlocked via Stellar smart contracts, enabling farmers and processors to fund larger shipments.\n    \n-   A trusted infrastructure for cross-border trade will be created, positioning Stellar as the backbone of Africa’s agri-fintech ecosystem.",
                        "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "Our go-to-market strategy is designed to ensure both grassroots adoption by farmers and market trust from exporters and buyers, using a decentralized but coordinated rollout model.\n\n1. Cooperative & Local Agent Onboarding  \nWe will deploy a network of trained local agents, modeled after our Tadamon mobilizer approach, embedded within 100+ existing farmer cooperatives and NGO programs. These agents will act as first-line support helping farmers set up Stellar wallets, capture IoT/QR-based production and harvest data, and understand NGNC payments. Local agents reduce barriers to adoption by offering hands-on technical assistance in rural areas where digital literacy and connectivity remain low.\n\n2. Pilot-to-Scale Pipeline  \nThe first cohort of 50+ farmers and 5 processors will transition from pilot use into production use on mainnet. Local agents will replicate this process across Kaduna, Kano, and Oyo, expanding to 500+ farmers within 6 months post-launch. Each cooperative cluster will become a mini-hub of traceable exports, ensuring scale while keeping onboarding costs low.\n\n3. Exporter Compliance Integration  \nExporters and processors will be integrated directly into AgTrail’s Stellar-powered traceability and certification modules. This ensures that every shipment automatically produces regulator-verified QR codes, compliant with NAFDAC, EU, and FDA FSMA standards. Exporters will also be early users of pay-per-trace flows and verification fee modules, anchoring them as paying customers from day one.\n\n4. Regulator & Buyer Trust Building  \nWe will partner with NAFDAC’s digital sandbox and European agrifood consultants to validate certification token logic and cross-border workflows. Verified pilot shipments (e.g., sesame and ginger) will serve as case studies, providing confidence to buyers and regulators. These documented proofs-of-compliance will be used to secure Letters of Intent (LOIs) from importers, unlocking premium pricing opportunities for farmers.\n\n5. Financial Access & Liquidity  \nThrough the Beans-App fiat bridge and partner banks, farmers will be able to instantly cash out NGNC payments to Naira, removing dependency on crypto literacy. Exporters and processors will gain access to invoice factoring and trade finance modules, ensuring liquidity for larger shipments. This financial backbone makes AgTrail not just a traceability tool, but a market-enabling infrastructure.\n\n6. Expansion Strategy  \nOnce export compliance and payments are proven in Nigeria, the model will replicate regionally across West Africa through cross-border cooperatives. Local agents will remain central to scaling, ensuring adoption is community-driven, regulator-approved, and buyer-verified.",

Remittances & Payments (Already built & testnet-integrated — not part of SCF 38 funding)\n\nProblem: Traditional remittance services in Africa cost 7–12% and take hours or days to settle, leaving refugees and unbanked without timely access to funds.  \nSolution: Instant USDC transfers to Lul wallets, with options to keep funds in USDC or withdraw via cash-out agents, couriers, or mobile money. Wallet-free payouts deliver cash directly to recipients without smartphones.  \nHow Stellar Helps: Near-instant, low-fee settlement and transparent proof of delivery on an open ledger.  \nImpact: Affordable, inclusive remittance access even for the most digitally excluded.\n\nNote: Included for completeness — not part of SCF 38 funding request.\n\n2. Crowdfunding\n\nProblem: Global platforms like GoFundMe exclude many Africans, especially refugees, due to banking and policy barriers.  \nSolution: Built-in Stellar-powered platform where users can launch campaigns, receive USDC globally, and withdraw in local currency. Soroban smart contracts hold funds in escrow until goals/timelines are met.  \nHow Stellar Helps: Enables low-cost cross-border contributions and escrow logic for secure disbursements.  \nImpact: Unlocks global fundraising for excluded communities with transparency and trust.\n\n3. Agent & Courier App\n\nProblem: Digital wallets are less useful if users can’t easily top up or withdraw nearby without high fees.  \nSolution: Lightweight app for agents/couriers to provide local cash-in/cash-out, including wallet-free deliveries, avoiding bank and mobile money margins.  \nHow Stellar Helps: Instant settlement between agent and user wallets with verifiable transaction records.  \nImpact: Increases access and convenience, especially in refugee camps and underserved areas.\n\n4. Virtual Cards (Planned – Integration with Rain.xyz)\n\nProblem: Many unbanked and refugee users can’t make online purchases or pay for digital services.  \nSolution: USD-denominated virtual cards linked to Lul wallets for online payments directly from USDC balances. API access to Rain is already secured.  \nHow Stellar Helps: Instant, low-cost top-ups from Stellar-based USDC.  \nImpact: Expands digital commerce access without requiring bank accounts.\n\n5. Multilingual Support\n\nProblem: Large portions of our user base do not speak English, creating adoption barriers.  \nSolution: Add Swahili, Luganda, Amharic, Arabic, Somali, and French to the app with a language switcher.  \nHow Stellar Helps: Makes the Stellar-powered platform usable across diverse remittance/refugee corridors.  \nImpact: Broadens reach and trust by making the platform accessible to non-English speakers.\n\n6. External Service Integrations\n\nProblem: Users need familiar, local cash-in/cash-out and cross-border transfer options.  \nSolution: Integrate mobile money APIs (MTN, Airtel) for local transactions and Yellow Card for USDC–fiat transfers to 20 African countries.  \nHow Stellar Helps: All transactions settle on Stellar for speed, low cost, and transparent tracking.  \nImpact: Expands reach and adoption by connecting to trusted payment rails across Africa.",

For us, success means removing those barriers—empowering people who have been overlooked to securely transact, save, and grow financially.\n\nThis is not just a technical mission—it’s deeply personal. All of us on the team have experienced this exclusion firsthand, and one of us still lives as a refugee. We know what it means to be locked out of financial opportunity, and our ultimate measure of success is to ensure that as many people as possible never have to face those same limitations again.",

This platform transforms Stellar’s IRL and virtual event presence into sustained onchain engagement — driving community retention, monthly active addresses, and TVL growth, while showcasing Stellar’s smart contract capabilities.\n\nCore Capabilities\n\n-   Event Discovery & Access: Real-time feed of Stellar and partner events, exclusive NFT/merch drops, and participation-based rewards.\n    \n-   Engagement Mechanics: Onchain games, scavenger hunts, achievement badges, leaderboards, and raffles/lotteries.\n    \n-   Integrated Rewards: Event-specific perks, NFT/merch issuance, and USDC/$IRL redemption via Stellar rails.\n    \n-   Future Payments Integration: Tap-to-pay NFC merchandise and in-event USDC/$IRL transactions.\n    \n\nFront-End & Feature Development (MVP & Global Map)\n\n-   User Dashboard & Profile with Stellar wallet integration (passkey-based onboarding).\n    \n-   Global Venue Map with in-person check-ins and point issuance.\n    \n-   Reward Center for perk redemptions and future $IRL/USDC spend mechanics.\n    \n-   IRL Four Square Game (online & in-person check-in challenges).\n    \n-   Leaderboard and achievement tracking.\n    \n-   Partner Dashboard for venue/creator reward issuance and payout tracking.\n    \n-   NFT Cultural Identity Module (opt-in) for unique event-based collectibles.\n    \n-   Basic Analytics Layer to track engagement, retention, and transaction flow.\n    \n\n#### Products & Services\n\nIRL will integrate Stellar in three major product layers:\n\n-   Points-to-Token Rewards: Users earn IRL Points via event check-ins and quests. These are redeemable for USDC or $IRL tokens issued on Stellar, enabling fast, low-cost incentives across borders.\n    \n-   Partner Dashboard & Wallet Tools: Venues and cultural institutions access a dashboard to distribute, track, and fund perks and rewards in Stellar-based assets.\n    \n-   Global Payment Rails: IRL enables ticket payments, creator payouts, and sponsor funding in Stellar-native assets, enhancing global financial access.\n    \n\nImpact: These integrations lower the cost of loyalty rewards, remove geographic limitations, and prove out a real-world consumer use case for onchain value exchange — onboarding thousands of users into the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nTechnical Infrastructure\n\n-   Wallet: Stellar-based smart wallet architecture using MeridianPay Base Wallet and passkey authentication.\n    \n-   Soroban Smart Contracts: Reward logic, onchain games, raffles, and point conversions.\n    \n-   Low-Cost Transactions: Using Stellar’s fast settlement and built-in DEX for liquidity and swaps.\n    \n\nInteroperability: Bridge functionality for Base/Solana → Stellar flows.\n\n-   2,000+ Stellar-based redemptions across events, perks, and quests.\n    \n-   $5,000+ processed in USDC/$IRL through the IRL dApp.\n    \n-   5,000+ Stellar-compatible wallets created via IRL and event activations.\n    \n-   Demonstrated proof that real-world cultural activity drives sustainable onchain engagement.\n    \n\n100+ partners enabled to issue or accept Stellar-backed rewards via the IRL partner dashboard.\n\nNote while we will be able work on all of the above through existing Refraction events - none of the funds from the SDF build award will go toward any marketing and events - which would happen through the Growth grants thereafter.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Kasi Money is a digital banking platform built for gig workers, freelancers, and the two out of three South African workers who earn irregular income. We are the official banking partner for Bolt, South Africa’s largest ride-hailing platform, and already serve over 50 000 customers. Our users receive a fully featured bank account and debit card to receive income, spend, and save. We also offer short term lending and automatic investing into a money market fund, giving customers both liquidity and yield.\n\n  \nOver 40% of our customer base are migrant workers from other African countries. For this group, the most requested feature is an affordable, fast way to send money home. Currently, they must withdraw funds from their Kasi Money account, visit a separate remittance provider, and pay 5 to 10 percent in fees, with some providers taking up to two days for settlement.\n\nThis project will add instant, low-cost remittances directly from the bank account they already receive their income in.  \n  \nCustomers will send fiat (ZAR) from their account, which is converted to USDC using a licensed South African crypto exchange. The USDC is then sent over Stellar and delivered via MoneyGram’s payout network for instant cash out in the recipient’s local currency. By integrating on-ramp, blockchain settlement, and off-ramp in one seamless flow, we eliminate multiple intermediaries, reduce costs to a fraction of current rates, and settle in minutes without exposing users to crypto complexity.  \n\nHow the new service will work:\n\n1.  Customer selects “Global Pay” from their Kasi Money account.\n    \n1.  Enters recipient details and payout country.\n    \n1.  ZAR is converted to USDC via a licensed South African exchange.\n    \n1.  USDC is transferred over Stellar to a Crossmint wallet linked to the sender.\n    \n1.  Recipient details together with USDC are transferred to MoneyGram dedicated wallet\n    \n1.  MoneyGram’s Stellar-based payout network instantly makes cash available in the recipient’s local currency.\n    \n1.  Recipient receives an SMS with pickup instructions for their nearest MoneyGram location.  \n    \n\nIn the initial phase, our Stellar integration will leverage native protocol features including:\n\n-   Payments for fast and low-cost USDC transfers\n    \n-   Trustlines to manage asset custody within Crossmint wallets\n    \n-   Multisig and pre-authorized transactions to maintain compliance and control over wallet movements\n    \n-   Memo fields to embed KYC-linked transaction references  \n    \n\nThese capabilities allow us to execute the full flow from ZAR → USDC → local-currency cash-out instantly, while meeting compliance requirements.  \n\nLooking ahead (not in this project scope), we will integrate Soroban smart contracts to:\n\n-   Implement programmable escrow logic for staged payouts or regulatory holds\n    \n-   Enable dynamic liquidity routing to optimize FX rates and provider selection by corridor\n    \n\nThis phased approach delivers immediate value to our customers and partners using Stellar’s proven core protocol, while building toward a programmable, scalable remittance infrastructure that can expand across Africa.",

It allows developers, analysts, and enterprises to query, visualize, and share insights on-chain—without building custom data pipelines or managing low-level infrastructure.\n\nAgnostic is now going all-in on Stellar. We are building a dedicated indexing and analytics stack for the Stellar blockchain, providing a unified interface for accessing both core ledger data and emerging smart contract activity via Soroban.\n\nOur mission is to make Stellar data programmable, observable, and shareable, using the full power of ClickHouse, SQL, and AI-assisted interfaces. Agnostic abstracts the raw complexity of blockchain data into intuitive analytics layers—enabling everything from simple balance lookups to cross-asset liquidity analytics or compliance dashboards\n\nThe Problem\n\nStellar is one of the most efficient and mature blockchain infrastructures, particularly suited for payments and stablecoins. However, visibility into Stellar’s on-chain activity remains fragmented and underutilized: - No common query language (Horizon is REST only) - No native SQL or BI integrations - Difficult to track smart contracts (Soroban) - Limited support for reproducible research\n\nFor developers and analysts accustomed to tools like Dune or Flipside on EVM, Stellar’s data tooling remains underdeveloped.\n\nThe Solution\n\nAgnostic builds a complete data analytics stack for Stellar:\n\n-   ch-stellar: A set of high-performance user-defined functions that enrich ClickHouse with Stellar-specific capabilities.\n    \n-   Open analytics tables: A set of analytics table in Apache Iceberg format produced by our ClickHouse-based ETL engine (AGT)\n    \n-   AGX: A data exploration UI leveraging ClickHouse that allows users to explore and query Stellar tables with SQL. AGX also empower users with an AI-powered query generation companion.\n    \n-   DGN: A collaborative platform for users to share and collaborate on Stellar data\n    \n\nAgnostic reduces development time and unlocks visibility for developers, liquidity providers, researchers, and institutions building on Stellar.",

Finalize and deploy Soroban smart contracts for parts traceability: Each aircraft part will be registered on-chain with a unique identifier. Ownership, certification status, usage metrics, and transfer events will be immutably recorded.\n    \n    ✅ Stellar Use: Uses Soroban to anchor verifiable part metadata and status updates on-chain.\n    \n    🎯 Impact: Brings transparency, combats counterfeit parts, and simplifies audits.\n    \n1.  Develop a REST API to simplify interactions with the Soroban smart contracts: AeroChain will expose an API layer for third-party integration. OEMs, MROs, Operators (Airlines) can push events like inspections, installations, and certifications without directly managing smart contracts.\n    \n    ✅ Stellar Use: The API wraps Stellar’s transaction logic, enabling role-specific operations via Soroban contracts.\n    \n    🎯 Impact: Lowers the barrier to adoption by integrating with existing ERP and maintenance tools.\n    \n1.  Launch a reference app (AeroChain App) tailored to MROs: This front-end application will allow MROs to register parts, update their status, and view certified histories. Additional dashboards for OEMs and regulators will follow.\n    \n    ✅ Stellar Use: Reads contract state via Horizon/Soroban RPC and pushes certified updates to Soroban.\n    \n    🎯 Impact: Enables rapid onboarding and provides an off-the-shelf solution for early adopters.\n    \n1.  Offer a developer SDK (Rust + Typescript): The SDK abstracts away the complexity of the Soroban environment and exposes typed helpers to build on-chain workflows faster.\n    \n    ✅ Stellar Use: Wraps Soroban logic with tested client libraries.\n    \n    🎯 Impact: Facilitates third-party integrations and encourages an ecosystem of complementary apps.\n    \n\nYou can also watch a demo of our current app here",

My approach is to put WebSoroban directly in the hands of developers at the exact moment they feel friction with existing tools.\n\n1. Address the Pain Point Directly\n\nWe’re targeting ex-Okashi dev users and active Soroban developers who are stuck dealing with complex CLI/SDK setups. We’ll position WebSoroban as the “open your browser and start building” alternative - removing setup entirely.\n\n2. Meet Developers Where They Build\n\nWe plan to launch at Stellar hackathons, DevRel events and within open-source communities. We’ll work with Stellar global ambassador network to host “Code in the Browser” workshops that get developers building in under 15 minutes.\n\n3. Build in Public\n\nWe’ll share progress updates, demos and new AI features on X, Discord and GitHub. By letting developers test features early, We’ll create feedback loops that turn early adopters into vocal advocates.\n\n4. Showcase Success Stories\n\nEvery project built with WebSoroban will become a proof point. We’ll spotlight developers who go from idea to mainnet deployment in a single weekend, showing exactly how fast and effective the tool is.\n\n5. Drive Network Effects\n\nWe’ll grow a library of community-built, Stellar-compliant contract templates, making it easier for the next wave of builders to get started. Every new deployed contract boosts Stellar’s network activity, transaction volume and overall mindshare.\n\nCore Principle: We’re not chasing hype - We’re removing friction. If WebSoroban saves hours for developers, they’ll tell others. As the word spreads, both adoption and the Stellar ecosystem will grow.",

Regulated Tokenized Investment Vehicles\n\nWe will issue a fully compliant security token representing a €500,000 loan pool, incorporating built-in logic to manage subscriptions, redemptions, and coupon payments.  \nThis token will be registered and distributed in accordance with applicable French and OHADA financial regulations.\n\n2. Investor Access & Onboarding\n\nUsing Stellar-compatible wallets (e.g., Freighter), investors in Europe and North America will be able to connect, complete KYC via Sumsub, and invest directly in vetted projects in Togo and Ghana.\n\nFor individuals indirectly impacted by our funding—such as tenants in financed buildings or suppliers in supported agribusinesses—we will onboard them to manage their cash flow on-chain.\n\nThis will involve integrating user-friendly wallets like Vibrant or Lobstr, enabling seamless conversion between local fiat currencies and on-chain assets.\n\nFor each loan pool, we anticipate a transaction volume approximately three times the invested capital; for example, a €500,000 pool is expected to generate around €1.5M in on-chain transactions.\n\n3. DeFi Integration for Yield Optimization\n\nWe plan to integrate staking, automated reinvestment of bond interest, and potential liquidity solutions—allowing users to maximize returns through DeFi-native strategies.\n\n4. On-Chain Monitoring & Transparency\n\nAll key events—including loan repayments, collateral updates, and social impact indicators—will be recorded immutably on-chain.  \nInvestors will have access to a transparent dashboard displaying real-time KPIs and financial flows.\n\n4 bis. On-Chain Local Integration with the Real Economy\n\nFor investments tied to OHADA economic participants, key financial transactions will also be executed on-chain.\n\nFor example, rent from the primary tenant in the first financed building will be paid directly on-chain, ensuring complete transparency from mobile money to wallet.\n\nThis model will onboard new Web3 users and generate recurring transaction volumes, as the entire payment infrastructure (e.g., rent collection systems) will be blockchain-based.\n\n  \n5. High-Impact Use of Funds\n\nFunds will be allocated to carefully selected infrastructure, renewable energy, and agricultural value chain projects.\n\nThese sectors were chosen for their strong multiplier effect on employment, supply chain resilience, and sustainable development.\n\nWe have also identified sustainability KPIs to monitor and ensure long-term impact.",

The system serves two primary stakeholder classes — Liquidity Providers (LPs) on the supply side and Traders/Borrowers on the demand side via an account-abstraction driven margin infrastructure directly connected to multiple derivatives and lending protocols.\n\nA) Liquidity Providers (Supply Side)\n\n-   Isolated Lending Pools: LPs supply assets (XLM, USDC, EURC) into protocol-isolated pools, eliminating cross-asset contagion and impermanent loss risks typical of AMM LPing.\n    \n-   Superior Yield Mechanics:\n    \n    a.  High Utilization Rates from leveraged borrowing demand (up to 10x capital amplification per trader), driving sustained borrow APRs above baseline market rates.\n        \n    a.  Liquidation Penalty Distribution, where penalties from leveraged position liquidations are shared directly with LPs in addition to interest income.\n        \n-   Capital Protection: Borrower funds remain in Vanna’s smart accounts, which operate under predefined protocol rules that control every action. All borrower interactions are processed through the risk engine, ensuring lenders’ capital is protected and lending risk remains fully contained within each isolated pool.\n    \n\nB) Traders / Borrowers (Demand Side)\n\n-   Account Abstraction Margin Accounts: Traders open Soroban-native smart accounts capable of managing multi-venue leveraged positions.\n    \n-   Undercollateralized Borrowing: Deposit initial margin and borrow up to 10x additional capital. Combined margin and debt can be programmatically allocated across supported markets:\n    \n    -   Leveraged LP Yields: Soroswap & Aquarius AMM LP positions with borrowed capital.\n        \n    -   Leveraged Spot Trading: Direct execution on Soroswap and Aquarius spot markets.\n        \n    -   Leveraged Lending Strategies: Yield generation via Blend lending pools.\n        \n-   Risk Optimization Layer: Professional-grade monitoring and hedging through an integrated dashboard, allowing you to track all active positions with payoff graphs and risk parameters, while enabling delta-neutral, leverage farming, looping leverage, and custom hedging strategies.\n    \n-   CEX-Grade UX On-Chain: Mimics traditional proprietary trading desks’ leverage workflows, fully ported on-chain through Soroban smart accounts.\n    \n\nProtocol Architecture (Soroban)\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe protocol architecture is built as a multi-layered execution and risk infrastructure with strict modular separation to optimize for security, composability, and protocol-integrated strategy automation.\n\n1. Core Infrastructure Layer\n\n-   Lending Pools Module: Supports XLM, USDC, EURC with isolated reserve logic and utilization-based dynamic interest rate curves.\n    \n-   Account Manager Module: Central transaction arbiter validating every margin operation, ensuring pre-execution health factor compliance.\n    \n-   Margin Account Module: Permission-gated, per-user contract instances supporting only protocol-approved leverage functions; enforces margin integrity.\n    \n-   Risk Engine Module: Real-time solvency computation for both overcollateralized and undercollateralized positions, integrated with liquidation automation triggers.\n    \n-   Interest Rate Model Module: Dynamic non-linear borrow/lend rate calculations (inspired by Sentiment Protocol), adapting to utilization changes.\n    \n-   Protocol Registry Module: On-chain mapping of all live controllers, adaptors, and integrated markets for deterministic protocol-level calls.\n    \n\n2. Leverage Execution Layer\n\n-   Controllers & Adaptors: Dedicated per-protocol controllers for Soroswap, Blend, Aquarius; abstract venue-specific logic while enforcing risk & leverage constraints.\n    \n-   Oracle Integration: Primary integration with Stellar Oracle SEP to source standardized, time-weighted price data for supported assets. Includes contingency for custom or third-party oracle providers if SEP coverage, latency, or reliability thresholds are not met, ensuring accurate pricing and robust failover in volatile markets.\n    \n-   Cross-Protocol Position Management: Enables simultaneous leverage allocation across LP, spot, and lending venues within a single health factor envelope.\n    \n\n3. User Interaction & Risk Visualization Layer\n\n-   Lending-Side Interface: Deposit, withdraw, and real-time pool utilization monitoring.\n    \n-   Margin-Side Interface: Create margin account, deposit collateral, borrow, repay, withdraw and dynamically reallocate leverage.\n    \n-   Trading-Side Interface: Customised, one-click execution for leveraged LP, leveraged spot, and leveraged lending positions.\n    \n-   Risk Management Dashboard: Continuous monitoring of live leveraged positions with health factor metrics, payoff curves and strategy simulation tools, all directly integrated with smart account operations\n    \n\nEngineering Scope & Execution Requirements\n\nThe Soroban deployment of Vanna demands a ground-up engineering approach due to the absence of pre-built EVM-equivalent standards and tooling. The build requires:\n\n-   Custom Lending Pools: Isolated accounting logic with utilization-based dynamic rates for XLM, USDC, EURC.\n    \n-   Account Abstraction Layer: Soroban-native margin accounts with protocol-enforced leverage permissions.\n    \n-   Cross-Venue Leverage Modules: Controller and adaptor contracts for Soroswap, Blend, and Aquarius with integrated risk constraints.\n    \n-   Multi-Source Oracles: Aggregated price feeds with failover handling for on-chain solvency checks.\n    \n-   GraphQL-Powered Indexing: Off-chain infrastructure to feed real-time position, health factor, and Greeks analytics to the risk dashboard.\n    \n\nThe execution plan includes full-cycle development — contract authoring, venue integrations, indexer and frontend implementation, stress testing under high-LTV scenarios, and multi-layer economic risk modelling — ensuring that the protocol meets the operational and economic security standards required for production deployment on Stellar.",

Active Margin Accounts\n\nDefinition: Number of unique margin accounts created and actively used by traders on Vanna.\n\nMeasurement Source: Protocol Registry & Account Manager contract calls tracking margin account creation and activity.\n\n-   Target:\n    \n    -   1 Week: ≥ 500 active margin accounts\n        \n    -   3 Months: ≥ 5,000 unique active margin accounts\n        \n\n4. Borrowing Volume\n\nDefinition: Total principal borrowed by traders via Soroban margin accounts.\n\nMeasurement Source: Borrow function events within Account Manager Module.\n\n-   Target:\n    \n    -   Month 1: $50K+ total borrowed\n        \n    -   Month 2 onwards: $200K+ total borrowed per month\n        \n\n5. Trading Volume Across Integrated Protocols\n\nDefinition: Aggregate trading volume generated by traders allocating borrowed capital across Soroswap, Aquarius, and Blend.\n\nMeasurement Source: Controller Module trade execution events, cross-DEX API logs.\n\n-   Target:\n    \n    -   Month 1: $500K+ monthly trading volume\n        \n    -   Month 3: $5M+ monthly trading volume\n        \n\nEvaluation Approach:\n\nAll metrics will be validated using on-chain analytics and off-chain data indexers feeding from GraphQL-powered infrastructure. For ecosystem transparency, performance will be visualized through public Dune dashboards, enabling stakeholders to monitor LP growth, TVL progression, borrowing volumes, trading activity, and health factor trends in real time. Data granularity will allow segmentation by market type (LP, spot, lending) and leverage tier, ensuring transparent progress reporting to the Stellar ecosystem and grant stakeholders.\n\nEcosystem Impact\n====================\n\nThe deployment of Vanna on Soroban is designed to create measurable, protocol-level impact across liquidity depth, trading activity, developer innovation, and user experience within the Stellar DeFi ecosystem. Each impact vector is tied to specific modules in Vanna’s architecture and will be tracked through on-chain analytics and public Dune dashboards.\n\n1. Liquidity Growth Across Stellar Protocols\n\n-   Mechanism: Vanna’s Lending Pools Module and undercollateralized margin architecture will migrate LP capital from integrated ecosystems such as Derive, Hyperliquid, and Katana, redirecting liquidity into Stellar LP and lending pools (Soroswap, Blend, Aquarius).\n    \n-   Impact: Redirect ≥ $5M in liquidity into Stellar LP and lending pools within 6 months.\n    \n-   Additional User Base Expansion: Partnerships with Plena and Blazpay will onboard users via retrospective airdrops and targeted campaigns; while their primary role is user acquisition, a subset of these users can transition into active LPs over time.\n    \n-   Validation: TVL increases recorded via lending pool reserve contracts and visualized in public dashboards.\n    \n\n2. Increased Trading Volumes Across Partner DEXs\n\n-   Mechanism: Controllers & Adaptors enable leveraged execution on Soroswap and Aquarius spot markets, plus yield farming via Blend. Borrowed capital will be actively cycled, increasing per-user trade velocity.\n    \n-   Impact: Drive ≥ $5M/month in additional trading volume across Stellar DEXs by Month 3 post-launch.\n    \n-   Validation: Aggregated trade execution events from controller contracts, cross-referenced with DEX APIs.\n    \n\n3. Strengthening Stellar’s Position as a Competitive DeFi Hub\n\n-   Mechanism: Composable leverage and cross-venue position routing provide CEX-grade trading UX on-chain, lowering the barrier for professional traders to operate within Stellar.\n    \n-   Impact: Position Stellar as a viable alternative to EVM ecosystems for high-frequency, multi-venue DeFi strategies.\n    \n-   Validation: Growth in unique active traders executing multi-market strategies as recorded in Account Manager logs.\n    \n\n4. Developer Enablement & Composability\n\n-   Mechanism: Open SDKs and APIs from the Protocol Registry allow other Stellar-based dApps to integrate Vanna’s credit layer and leverage routing without duplicating core lending/borrowing logic.\n    \n-   Impact: Enable at least 3 third-party protocol integrations within the first year.\n    \n-   Validation: Integration contracts registered in the Protocol Registry and usage tracked via API calls.\n    \n\n5. User Experience Advancement\n\n-   Mechanism: Integrated risk dashboard with real-time Greeks, payoff graphs, and health factor monitoring allows traders to manage leveraged portfolios entirely within Stellar.\n    \n-   Impact: Improve execution quality, reduce liquidation rates for active traders by ≥ 20% compared to baseline CEX/DEX averages.\n    \n-   Validation: Liquidation and PnL data logged by Risk Engine and surfaced in dashboards.\n    \n\nTransparency & Monitoring:\n\nAll impact metrics will be continuously tracked through on-chain logs and surfaced in public Dune dashboards, enabling the Stellar community, LPs, traders, and grant stakeholders to independently monitor liquidity migration, TVL growth, trading activity, and integration adoption in real time.",
