Month 2: Launch extensive marketing and community outreach, focusing on Celo ecosystem. Month 4: Onboard initial cohort of 50 merchants, focusing on Celo-native projects.","Projections: We anticipate Pay Protocol to significantly boost crypto payments adoption across various industries, especially within the Celo ecosystem. Given our successful integrations with multiple sectors such as retail, financial services, and Web3 businesses, we project exponential growth in transaction volumes and user engagement, particularly as more merchants and institutions seek decentralized and cost-effective payment solutions.Usage Expectations: We foresee Pay Protocol becoming a standard for businesses wanting to accept crypto payments, projecting thousands of merchants using our service within the next 12 months. Our system's ability to cut gas fees by over 80%, and up to 95% in batch operations, makes it highly attractive for both small and large enterprises.Ongoing Costs Estimate: Our operational costs primarily consist of continuous protocol development, contract audits, market expansion and customer support. We estimate monthly ongoing costs between $30,000 to $50,000, with the majority allocated towards development and security upgrades to maintain a robust, secure protocol.Hiring Expectations: Yes, we plan to expand our team within the next 6-18 months. Key roles include blockchain developers, front-end engineers, smart contract auditors, and business development professionals. These hires will focus on scaling the protocol, expanding integrations, and optimizing system performance to meet demand.Potential roadblocks and mitigation strategies: A potential roadblock is merchant reluctance to adopt crypto payments due to the understanding of crypto industry and technical barriers. To mitigate this, we will focus on simplifying integration, offering comprehensive onboarding support, and collaborating with Celo’s network.","At the end of our development phase, the Celo Community (users, projects, developers) will have access to a fully operational, decentralized payment system that is deeply integrated into the Celo ecosystem. Pay Protocol will enable merchants to accept crypto payments easily, reducing operational costs while enhancing financial transparency and security.

These documents will serve as a resource for the broader Celo ecosystem, highlighting learnings and successes from each event.","With continued support, Giveth House aims to become the go-to space in Barcelona for Celo and Web3 contributors focused on public goods, sustainability, and financial inclusion. By creating a steady flow of workshops, residencies, and hackathons, we project an increase in community engagement, anticipating that Giveth House will host over 250+ contributors within the next year, including global Celo advocates, builders, and innovators. This Growth Pool grant will be essential in maintaining Giveth House as an accessible and fully operational space by covering rent and ongoing expenses, allowing us to keep the house open and welcoming to all. With these funds, we’ll sustain daily co-working, offer event spaces, and create a supportive environment that aligns with Celo’s vision.

One significant roadblock we foresee is the rising real estate prices and increasing demand in Barcelona’s property market, which could pose challenges in securing long-term stability for Giveth House. To mitigate this risk, we plan to strengthen our community and financial foundations by continuing to host high-value events and hackathons. Additionally, by encouraging ongoing donations from the Celo community and establishing partnerships with like-minded organizations, we will work to ensure the house remains a secure, open, and inspiring space for the Celo ecosystem.","By supporting Giveth House, the Celo community gains a well-established hub dedicated to advancing financial inclusion, sustainable projects, and public goods.

We’re also exploring collaborations with other ecosystems that share Celo’s mission, aiming to diversify support and create a resilient funding base for the long term.","If we do not receive this grant, we will continue to operate through our current donation-based model, relying on the generosity of the community and aligned contributors to support Giveth House’s mission. We would also keep actively searching for alternative funding sources, including grants and sponsorships that align with our Public Goods values. Our commitment to fostering a collaborative and accessible space remains unwavering, and while a lack of funding might limit some of our planned upgrades and event expansions, we will prioritize maintaining the core offerings of Giveth House. This ensures we can still provide a welcoming environment for Celo-aligned projects and contributors.","To demonstrate the successful completion of this project and secure the final funding release, Giveth House will organize a dedicated Celo community event. This will serve as both a celebration and a milestone, showcasing the enhanced capabilities of Giveth House as a fully operational and resource-rich hub for the Celo ecosystem.We envision this milestone event as a large-scale gathering in partnership with organizations like ReFi DAO, Web3Family and Akasha hub. It will include workshops, networking sessions, and a hackathon segment for developers focused on building public goods, sustainable finance models, and Celo-aligned projects.

This measured approach ensures we maintain an open line with the community without stretching beyond our capacity.

2. Updates on the Celo Forum: Every few months, we’ll post a summary on the Celo Forum, capturing recent activities and inviting the community to follow along. These updates will be brief but intentional, designed to foster a quiet sense of togetherness and keep Giveth House’s work accessible to anyone interested.

3. Hosting Celo Community Members in Barcelona: For those attending Kuneco town halls, we invite Celo contributors to stay with us at Giveth House and get to know the web3 community of Barcelona.

Indeed we have recruted a developer able to develop our smart contract in Celo and our custody fireblocks allow us to make it easy to scale our service.In the Futur we at being gathering point for the Celo member in West Africa and especially in Togo.  We have identified the right persons to make sure that a community event could happen in mid 2025 if we conclued a partnership agreement.","Minah goal is to become a pan african loan platform. We wanna be a alternative to banks for people to obtain debt financing. On the other side we want to be the gateway to a smart and safe exposure to the african region for western countries financial players.Our go-To-Market strategy combines technological innovation and strategic market penetration.Starting with the Alpha version in Q4 2024, we'll establish a foundational technical setup and make initial investments (50K€) in RWAs located in Togo. Progressing to the Beta version (Q1 2025), we aim to expand our investment volume and integrate liquidity solutions. S2 2025, our focus will shift to wider African markets and B2B investments, solidifying Minah.io's position in the digital real estate sector.Alpha Version (Q4 2024):Technical Infrastructure: Establish simple, secure and efficient blockchain framework essential for the reliability of the platform.Initial Real Estate Investment: Begin with a €[40-50]K investment in Togolese real estate, demonstrating the practical application of the platform. Assets are brought into the company by the founders, in order to build trust and demonstrate the real assets backing.Community Building (B2C): Alpha version will be a key moment to create a community around the project and the platform. The main drivers of community building will be (i) European African diaspora and (ii) tech-savvy individuals. This will involve active engagement through social media, online forums, and targeted events such as educational Initiatives like webinars about investment opportunities in Africa.⇒ A part of the CELO grant would be useful for this step, namely to finance the technical infrastructure and to start getting meaningful networking opportunities withing the african Celo communityBeta Version (Q1/Q2 2025):Scale Investment Volume: We plan to increase the investment scope within Togo (target of 10x) by diversifying into different real estate sectors and locations in Togo.Liquidity Pool Integration: Liquidity being a key factor in RWA operations, we plan on adding a liquidity feature to our platform in order to provide exit options for investors. This will showcase the platform's flexibility and investor-friendly nature.Business Model Validation: Ensure the viability and scalability of the tokenomic strategy through detailed analysis and adaptation to local market dynamics.B2B Market Penetration: Initiate outreach to B2B clients, including real estate and infrastructure funds, focusing on impact investment opportunities. This phase will involve creating investment solutions for businesses and presenting Minah.io as a new investment avenue in the African real estate market.⇒ A part of the CELO grant would be use for the BtoB market penetration. We could start building a notoriety strategy by targeting Key Opinion Leaders on the West African financing sector. Workshops and meetups explaining how the Minah product could be used to facilitate funding would be the perfect way to do it.The use of Celo Application such as Opera Minipay could also be a practical usecase to convince them.V1 (S2 2025):Geographical Expansion: Extend operations to countries like Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Bénin, guided by extensive market research and improved local partnerships.Opening B2B Investments: Establish a structured approach for engaging with businesses and institutional investors, leveraging the platform's track record from the Beta phase.","We are submitting this application as our MVP is nearing completion.Our tech stack is complete, and our priority is now to align with the right blockchain platform that best addresses the challenges we’ll face in a crossborder environment.More specifically, during the initial phase our objective is to facilitate debt capital flows for projects, primarily focused on real estate and land-based opportunities in West Africa.Our first projections indicate achieving a Total Value Locked (TVL) of €1-2M during the testing period next year, scaling up to €10M by the end of 2026. This would suggest the successful onboarding of around 20-30 debt structuring deals. Notably, we already have a pipeline with opportunities valued at €1.5M, including a qualified pipeline (i.e., signed Letters of Intent) worth +200K€ euros. This demonstrates the attractiveness and feasibility of our model.To achieve these objectives, it will be necessary to expand our team by recruiting two additional full-time developers. Furthermore, we will require the support of a robust legal team, including lawyers, accountants, notaries, and banking partners, to manage the significant volume of contracts. As working with Real World Assets inherently involves off-chain negotiations, addressing regulatory and contractual complexities is a critical component of our strategy.Also, a significant part of our budget will be allocated to building a high-quality B2B network in the regions we plan to penetrate. Developing strong local relationships is essential to overcome potential regulatory hurdles. To accelerate this process, we are considering hosting an industry-focused event in mid-2025, bringing together key stakeholders from the private debt sector. This initiative will not only help establish the necessary connections but will also serve as a catalyst for the rapid expansion of our project.","At the and of our product development, the Celo community will gain access to a Real World Asset (RWA) bridge project, providing direct exposure to the African real economy through tokenized debt instruments.2. This innovation enables DeFi protocols built on Celo to directly integrate tokenized debt tied to corporate bonds, offering users a stable and yield-generating asset class. By diversifying investment portfolios, this bridge creates real value for the Celo ecosystem and its users, blending financial returns with impact-driven opportunities in emerging markets.3. Moreover, the main part of our platform will be open source, improving collaboration and innovation within the Celo ecosystem. By the end of 2025, we plan to launch a utility token, tradeable across various platforms, enhancing even more the platform's usability and creating new","We completed an initial friends-and-family round of €23,000. Now we are in the final stages of a new funding round, with €50,000 already committed and soft commitments for an additional €150,000.","Looking ahead, we aim to raise around €1.5–3 million next year after funding our first two projects to demonstrate MVP traction. This funding will fuel strategic expansion into multiple countries and replicate our model in new countries.","Wether we get this grant or not the plan would still go ahead since we we are also expecting equity funding. That being said, we really want to be part of the Celo ecosystem, and having this grant would be a way to secure our use of your infrastructure while deploying into a continent you understand and where you are already implemented.","The project will be considered as complete and successful when users can seamlessly invest in tokenized debt linked to Real World Asset (RWA) projects in Togo through our platform. This milestone will demonstrate the operational readiness of the ecosystem.Additionally, being able to trade these tokens on a secondary market, fully managed on our platform, will mark another significant achievement in providing liquidity and flexibility to investors.At that stage, the focus will shift from technical development to business growth and scaling, with a focus on securing partnerships and contracts to expand the ecosystem further. This will ensure that the foundation is fully operational and scalable.","We have  identified a few protocol providing loans :LednCentrifugeGoldfinchAtlendisNevertheless the only one with a almost perfect similaire position is Credix. We have the same angle, with the only difference that Credix is specialized in LATAM region.What makes us different with the others is the ability to have legal contract with key financial players locally. Without these knowledge it's very difficult to not be expose to the credit risk. it is one of the main failure of Centrifuge.","The idea, is not unique. there are already some private debt funds that already existe. GTL Capital is one of them, and we know their core team quite well.Nevertheless, no one has done this model on-chain.Goldfinch has tried do to something similar but they lack African knowledge. We have adapted this go to market strategy to make it more accurate for the region.","Goldfinch is a very good example in this domain.They have created pools to finance development in regions like Africa, but they faced significant defaults that have reduced their growth. This is primarily due to two critical challenges:Risk Management and Collateral Oversight:Goldfinch struggled to account for the inherently high-risk nature of these regions. A scalable approach requires externalizing the management of collateral to ensure proper oversight and reduce exposure to loans defaults.Local Presence and Expertise:Successful projects in these regions demand a strong local presence. It is essential to have team members on the ground in each country to manage and monitor operations effectively. As a Franco-Togolese team, we possess a significant competitive advantage. Our deep understanding of local dynamics and direct connections to these markets give us a unique edge.In addition, a core aspect of our approach is the proactive monitoring of financed projects to ensure they remain on track to repay the loans. To further mitigate risks, we are in advanced discussions with local banks and financial institutions to hedge 100% of default risks.By combining local expertise with strategic professional partnerships, Minah intends to address the gaps observed in other protocols and to pave the way for sustainable growth in the loan vertical.","We are a Real-World Asset (RWA) solution focused on debt issuance to finance real estate and land-based projects. This innovative approach generates significant yield from tokenized debt assets, directly aligning with Celo’s mission to bridge real-world impact with blockchain technology.Our project is cohesive with the Celo ecosystem and broader Ethereum alignment strategy in several key ways:On-Chain Yield Collection:From the very first project, we plan to implement an on-chain solution for collecting rental income from financed properties, leveraging tools like Opera Minipay on the Celo blockchain. This approach ensures a seamless integration of real-world cash flows into the blockchain ecosystem, creating transparency and efficiency for all stakeholders.DeFi Integration and Yield Optimization:Once the yield is collected on-chain, we aim to collaborate with other DeFi protocols within the Celo ecosystem. These collaborations will focus on maximizing returns for investors and potentially using tokenized debt as collateral, reinforcing the utility and scalability of Celo's DeFi offerings.Alignment with Ethereum’s Broader Ecosystem:Our project adheres to Ethereum standards, enabling smooth interoperability with Ethereum-based protocols. This positions us as a natural fit for Celo’s L2 strategy, which focuses on creating synergies within the Ethereum ecosystem while driving financial inclusion through blockchain.Local Impact Meets Global Technology:By integrating blockchain solutions in emerging markets, such as rental yield collection and land financing, our project not only expands Celo’s footprint in high-potential regions but also demonstrates the practical utility of blockchain in driving sustainable development.In conclusion, our project complements Celo’s mission by introducing impactful RWA solutions that merge financial innovation, blockchain technology, and real-world impact.","Business Projection:By the end of 2025, our best case scenario envisions €2M in Total Value Locked (TVL) on the platform, representing approximately 8 projects with an average size of €250K each. In a more conservative scenario, we expect to achieve €1M in TVL, supported by the fact that 50% of this amount has already been identified and secured for the first half of 2025.Technology and Legal Framework:We aim to develop an administrative dashboard to streamline the submission process for businesses seeking access to standardized debt. This tool will include pre-defined contracts, ensuring efficiency and compliance. It will serve as a bridge between financial requirements, the technological platform, and the setup of collateral mechanisms in case of default. This will position our platform as a scalable and reliable RWA solution.DeFi Integration:By late 2025, we plan to introduce a utility token that captures the added value generated by all projects on the platform. This token will serve as an innovative financial instrument, enhancing liquidity and providing additional incentives for investors within the platform’s ecosystem.In summary, within 12 months, we envision a fully operational platform with measurable business success, robust technological infrastructure, and integration into the DeFi ecosystem, laying the foundation for sustainable growth.","
If successful, Minah.io is committed to actively engaging with the wider Celo community to ensure transparency, collaboration, and the dissemination of knowledge from this project. Our plan includes:

Our focus and involvement with Celo has primarily focused on building Washika DAO as a decentralized governance and savings protocol. We’re already in partnership discussions with various projects in the Celo community, particularly Haraka, Grassroots economies and Finna protocol, those focusing on financial inclusion and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the unbanked. We’ve also worked to integrate Celo’s stablecoin cUSD into our platform to facilitate secure, stable, and low-cost financial transactions for users who are often excluded from traditional banking systems. In Kenya, Clinton, our lead dev is an active member of the Celo community all across 2023 & 2024, dealing with a variety of solutions such as B2B Loyalty Management System, Incentivized Citizen Journalizing Platform, and cKES integrations. As we grow, we plan to continue our contributions by sharing lessons learned, providing feedback, and developing solutions that further Celo’s mission of financial inclusion. Furthermore we’ve chosen Celo because its mobile-first infrastructure and commitment to financial inclusion align perfectly with our mission to provide decentralized financial services to marginalized communities in East Africa. Additionally, we've attended workshops and community events and have been active in Celo's forums, learning from other projects and sharing insights from our experiences working with underserved communities in Tanzania, Kenya & Africa overall.","Project Goals: Washika DAO’s core goal is to provide decentralized, community-driven savings and lending solutions for marginalized groups such as Village Community Banks (VICOBAs), SACCOS, and Chamas in Tanzania and Kenya. With the Growth Pool grant, we aim to enhance the platform infrastructure and achieve key milestones that will help drive financial inclusion in these regions. Project Steps (4-month timeline): Platform Enhancements (Month 1-2): Finalize the core smart contracts for savings pools, share purchases, and decentralized governance. Modify UX according to feedback & Complete the integration of cUSD for secure, stablecoin-based transactions. User Onboarding & Education (Month 2-3): Develop user-friendly onboarding for members of community groups. Roll out educational resources and workshops specifically on educating users on the use and importance of stablecoins such as cUSD for store of value, as well as cKES for local context in exchange, savings and yield. This will drive engagement of stablecoin adoption as well as prepare them for the digital economy as well as a local stablecoin in Tanzania. Project expansion in Dar es salaam & Feedback Loop (Month 3-4): Expand reach in 2-3 communities (targeting 200+ members). Gather user feedback, improve user experience, and refine platform features based on real-world usage. Governance and Community Voting Mechanism (Month 4): Implement and test decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing users to participate in decision-making. Measurable Outcomes: Onboard at least 200 active users. Deploy core smart contracts for savings, share purchasing, and governance. Facilitate 100 community pooled saving transactions using cUSD. Expand reach in at least 3 communities within Tanzania. Gather feedback and release an updated version of the platform.","Projections: Usage Expectations: User Growth: We expect to onboard 500+ users within 6 months, scaling to over 1,000 users within a year. Share Purchase Volume: We estimate over 200 members purchasing 2-5$ shares every week in the first 6 months, (in cUSD). Savings Growth: We aim to grow savings deposits by 20% month-over-month in the first 6 months. Illustrating the store of value aspect rather than holding local fiat. Ongoing Costs: Platform development & Maintenance: These include server costs, smart contract audits, and security. Salaries as well as onboarding Community Based Teachers (CBTs) who are a part of the wider network for onboarding savings groups. Educational Outreach: Community workshops and user training programs. 	Hiring Projections (Next 6-18 months): Community Managers (Community Based Teachers, CBTs): To support local communities and onboard users. They operate as part of an extended network. Smart contract Developer: To scale platform infrastructure and integrate additional features such as insurance for savings and loans as well as DAO management functions which would act as savings groups. 	Potential Roadblocks: Adoption Barriers: Communities may be slow to adopt the technology due to limited access to smartphones or skepticism around crypto and digital finance. Mitigation: We are abstracting most of the crypto and Web3 aspects from communities. Users will be able to register with their mobile phone numbers / emails and obtain a Web3 wallet in the backend. Extensive user education and collaboration with local leaders will be key. We have also begun engagements with Kotani Pay, also in the Celo ecosystem on on & off-ramp solutions for these communities as well as how they can potentially support community members with feature phones through USSD solutions. We will also provide mobile-friendly tools and interfaces to simplify access. We are also localizing our infrastructure to serve local communities with both English and Swahili language features.","Presence in Tanzania and establishment of Celo Tanzania community, an area where Celo has not yet tapped into. We believe this will be the beginning of Celo’s mission in Tanzania where there is a vibrant growing community of Web3 builders and enthusiasts. Furthermore, we are planning on having a public dashboard where the whole community can track impact made on ground with the community such as no of people onboarded, transactions done, proposals being put up by members of the community,  savings & shares purchased in cUSD and much more. Furthermore, we believe in Open Source principles, A fully functional decentralized governance and savings platform and onestop shop for Village Community Banks, SACCOs and Chamas that directly aligns with Celo’s mission of fostering prosperity and financial inclusion. We believe these contributions will be important to the broader DeFi ecosystem, with governance and financial management tools that can be adapted for similar use cases not only in developing or marginalized communities, but globally as well.","We have not yet received formal investment for Washika DAO. However, we have secured support from various community organizations, local government and local leaders, who are enthusiastic about integrating decentralized finance into their savings and lending operations. We have also received support from The Ministry for empowering marginalized communities in Tanzania recognizing our work in digitizing savings groups. Furthermore, We have also received support from Web3 public goods funding in Gitcoin to kickstart our building operations so far.","If we receive this grant, we are looking to raise our Pre-seed round so we can fully capture the market all over Tanzania and expand to neighboring countries as well such as Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, we expect this to be sometime in Q3 2025. Furthermore, we are aligning with strategic partnerships with organizations focused on financial inclusion in Africa, such as NGOs or microfinance institutions. Additionally, we are targeting social impact investors and partnership-based funding from organizations focused on financial inclusion and decentralized finance in emerging markets. This includes banks and micro-finance institutions.","If we do not receive this grant, we will continue building Washika DAO on a more limited scale, relying on community resources and donations. However, the speed at which we can onboard users and launch key features would be slower, and we may need to scale back some of our community outreach efforts.","Our final milestone will be the deployment of a fully functional, user-friendly platform for savings, shares purchasing, and governance; A one stop shop for community groups. This will include: Smart contracts that are audited and deployed on Celo. A minimum of 200 active users using the platform. Functional governance, pooled savings and share redistribution operations with cUSD. Governance tools in place, enabling community voting. At the end of the project, we will submit reports, metrics on user adoption, and a working v2 demo of the platform to the Celo community.","Yes, there are similar projects such as GoldFinch on Ethereum and Haraka & HaloFi on Celo. These platforms offer decentralized lending and borrowing. However, our focus is specifically on community-driven savings and lending for marginalized groups in Africa on top of decentralized governance frameworks, which makes Washika DAO unique. Differentiators: Local Focus: Washika DAO is tailored for local communities, with a focus on VICOBAs and SACCOs. Savings: We emphasize community savings, not just borrowing, offering more accessible financial inclusion tools. Share purchase and allocation. As part of weekly meetups, community members normally purchase 2-5$ worth of shares per week. This is also used as collateral once applying for loans. We are looking to bring this mechanism onchain and drive transactions and store of value through stablecoin usage.","Yes. Washika DAO is unique because it brings decentralized savings (not just lending) to underserved African communities, combined with governance tools that allow community members to have a direct say in how their financial system is managed.  It is important to note these communities already do this off-chain on a physical ledger where they purchase weekly shares, vote on proposals, micro-loans within the groups and much more. The reason Web3 is important for these communities is immutability and secure store of records for history. This also enables them to have transparent records as it is only a few members or at times one that controls the treasury. Furthermore, web3 allows for the access to liquidity and alternative financing through DeFi and Web3 liquidity providers. This provides much needed liquidity for these communities onground to run their operations. This model directly addresses the challenges of financial exclusion in rural and semi-urban areas.","We’ve researched similar protocols like HaloFi and Haraka, which offer decentralized savings and lending respectively, but we focus more on community-based savings, share allocation and integrating local governance structures. Our platform is designed to complement and enhance existing community savings groups rather than compete with traditional DeFi platforms. Each of these community members meet every week and purchase shares of around $2-5 every week to ensure sustainability and we are looking to do this on Celo. Furthermore, While HaloFi, a savings platform focuses on gamified savings and financial education, Washika DAO addresses specific needs of community savings groups in Tanzania with a unique, community-driven savings and lending model. Our platform provides stablecoin-based lending and community governance features, empowering users to make financial decisions collectively. Unlike HaloFi’s individual-focused gamification, Washika DAO is built to handle group financial management, tailored for local informal savings structures, and designed to offer transparency and security through DeFi tools specifically optimized for these underserved communities.","Washika DAO is fully aligned with Celo’s mission of prosperity for all. By leveraging Celo’s mobile-first approach and stablecoins (cUSD), we ensure that our platform is accessible even to users with basic smartphones. In the long run, we will also introduce USSD services to compliment members without a smartphone. We also see opportunities to integrate with Celo’s L2 strategy, expanding the use of DeFi for local markets and utilizing bridges between Ethereum and Celo to further enhance our platform.","In 12 months, we envision Washika DAO being the go-to platform for governance community savings and lending in East Africa, with: 5,000+ active users across multiple regions. Expanded features like insurance for loans, staking mechanisms, and educational resources. Deep integration with local financial systems, helping communities grow and sustain their financial activities.","Our code is fully open-source Washika DAO’s allowing other projects within the Celo ecosystem to leverage our codebase. We believe in transparency and encourage community-driven contributions.
We also plan to run live demos and tutorials, both virtual and in-person, to showcase Washika DAO’s features and benefits. Hosting a session at Kuneco and other similar Celo events will allow us to directly engage with the community, share insights from our pilot, and gather valuable feedback.
Our team will also create a detailed blog & forum post documenting the outcomes and impact of the Washika DAO pilot, along with the technical solutions developed. This will include insights into user adoption, community impact, and lessons learned.

We will also announce collaborations with other projects in the Celo ecosystem such as Haraka, Grassroots econ & KotaniPay to maximize reach and adoption, potentially creating a shared dashboard to track and visualize ecosystem impact, fostering a cohesive community.",[object Object],Jessica Gaubert from Haraka,Article with Solar Foundation on pilot with Solar Savings circles for women: https://www.solarfoundation.xyz/post/washikadao-protocol-innovation-meets-tradition-for-real-world-community-impact-in-africa,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Washika DAO,"WashikaDAO (Washikadau),a Swahili word for ""stakeholders"" is a decentralized savings, lending and governance platform tailored for underserved communities in Africa, such as Village Community Banks (VICOBAs), SACCOS, and Chamas. Built on the Celo, Washika DAO enables community members to pool their resources, save securely, and access alternative financing in loans with transparent, community-based governance. The platform is designed to replace traditional, informal savings methods that often lack transparency and security with a modern, blockchain-powered solution that is accessible, affordable, and secure.
A unique feature of Washika DAO is its share purchase and allocation model, where members can buy shares ranging from $2 to $5 weekly. This model operates off-chain on a ledger book however we are bringing it on-chain. This model allows users to invest in the DAO at a level that is affordable and aligned with their financial capacities. The purchase of shares provides users with a stake in the platform, allowing them to participate in governance, vote on key decisions, and share in any potential growth of the DAO. These shares serve as both a financial commitment to the platform and a mechanism for community-driven decision-making, fostering transparency and trust among members. By combining community-driven savings, accessible micro-lending, and stablecoin transactions in cUSD, Washika DAO empowers members with financial tools tailored to their needs, all while contributing to the growth of decentralized finance in underserved regions. We also have an inbuilt DAO toolkit where community members can learn more on digital literacy, savings, digital assets and much more all in localized context.",https://x.com/NedaLabs,https://github.com/NEDA-LABS/WashikaDao,https://washikadao.on-fleek.app/,0x037Eb04AD9DDFf984F44Ce5941D14b8Ea3781459,"David Machuche,Victor Muhagachi",0x037eb04ad9ddff984f44ce5941d14b8ea3781459,"davidmachuche@gmail.com,v.muhagachi@gmail.com","https://x.com/machuche1,https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-muhagachi-ab4234160/"

With that said, we're substantially improving the offering of MetaLex.tech by adding an arbitration system to their Ricardian escrow contracts, which will also inherit useful capabilities from our DeFi protocol (ETH insured while in escrow; ways to compensate jurors).MetaLex deals with cybernetic law: Ricardian contracts combine the best properties of legal agreements and smart contracts to provide people better tools for doing various kinds of business, from OTC token swaps, to delivery of goods and services over extended periods. When delivery is met with challenges, may platforms fall short because arbitration is not something they can provide good market-based solutions for with respect to due process.",8 other repos in our github.com/QuidLabs/,North America,Other,Rico audited Celo's Solidity contracts while employed as a team lead at CertiK in 2020.,"We aim to successfully execute a guarded launch, growing the protocol's market cap in a linear manner by limiting how much insurance capital can be deposited; the protocol cannot extend credit, or underwrite more value beyond the dollar amount of insurance capital. This means a maximum of 66M QD minted in the first four months on L1. By February, we aim to have a complete demo for Milestone 2 (running on L2) to present live at conferences... there is detailed breakdown of milestone components here: http://hackmd.io/@quid/mint","Our primary projections are in the following excel sheet, related to usage expectations, and are baked into the implementation of our ERC20 mint function (disregard final row) https://bit.ly/3q4tShSOngoing costs are 12k annual fees; we did all the work for Milestone 1 internally, but Milestone 2 involves hiring a dedicated designer, and customer success representativeas such, the first tranche of the Prezenti grant would cover this year's annual fees, with the foundation director carrying on his roles as the backend architect, etc. concerning these please refer to the following document http://hackmd.io/@quid/mintA potential roadblock we've envisaged: price shocks like the one we've seen earlier this year due to the yen carry trade. Something like this may cause a cascade of liquidations on multiple external venues, leading to a sharp drop in ETH's price. Since our protocol mints tokens only provided that capital adequacy is still maintained by the risk budget, to mitigate possible denial of service on our end, we've developed a protocol-level ""insurer of last resort"", whose functionality depends on using staked USDe from our reserve assets, leveraged as collateral for borrowing DAI from Morpho (in an emergency only).","Сelo gets the distilled result of our 6 years' experience building in DeFi. Our legacy code-base (under a repo called ""legacy"" in our Github org) implemented an options pricing strategy that was more traditional, and cost-based. Despite its flaws, it was the 1st structured product in DeFi, and inspired Liquity. Our final solution is more value-based, including a distribution strategy which goes beyond DeFi to create real-world value for service providers in the creative fields, providing them the best marketplace possible.",$15k from ManifoldFinance.com in the last 12 months,"Uniswap, Ethena, and Taiko...likely in December. Potentially, also from Morpho Labs. If the protocol works as designed, and our fair launch goes as planned, funding will be unlocked programmatically to the team on a regular basis, providing necessary resources for further development as well as community incentivisation (e.g. rewarding quality effort in jury duty).","Regardless, we'll launch Milestone 1 on L1 mainnet; but for compliance, our annual fees must be paid well before December holidays; receiving this grant allows us to get that out of the way ASAP, guaranteeing our possibility of working for another 6 months to 2 years on quid.io including Milestone 2, and potentially more growth strategies we come up with in the process.","Updates regarding the audit of our mainnet deployment: https://x.com/purrcateth/status/1840348201666138540^any remediations that may arise must be addressed by 12/12including a re-deployment of contracts if deemed necessary:this is considered part of the deliverables of our Milestone 1.The Celo Community gets Milestone 2, which we may only buildby leveraging our progress with Milestone 1 as a pre-requisite...the reason for this is mentioned here: http://hackmd.io/@quid/mint","In regards to Milestone 1: yEarn crowdsources cross-protocol strategies from Solidity developers, and gives depositors the flexibility of choosing which strategy they like best. We provide flexibility, but in a more controlled manner, through a bespoke all-weather strategy with a small, secure codebase.In regards to Milestone 2:Escrow platforms require arbitration, and most of them out-source this to Kleros. This is problematic not only from a centralisation standpoint, but also because of the way in which Kleros implements jury selection: the solution deserves an approach which mirrors judicial standards more accurately, thereby removing dependency on a volatile ""governance token"" ","We provide the highest yields for staking stablecoins, in a one-stop shop where you can also protect your ETH from price drops, or borrow against in the safest way possible. Our Modus Operandi is incredibly simple, and this is the main reason it is effective. Pendle shares a similar trait of separating yield from principle; our protocol keeps the yield in order to capitalise the QD token. The logic is cost-effective, both in terms of gas (system design) and end-user costs. The end-to-end character also shortens the customer-acquisition pipeline, not only benefitting the conversion rate in the sense of financial friction, but also in upselling.","Liquity compounds yield on depositors' collateral, but also compounds the liabilities that depositors must absorb. We've made a considerable cost/value trade-off which both... increases the value (compounding of Uniswap LP fees), AND decreases the cost (liabilities are NOT compounded, although they accumulate over the course of a year, absorbed when QD tokens mature and  become redeemable). We also offer protection from liquidations, unlike Liquity, and perform them in more graceful manner (gradated over a month).Many protocols manage LP positions for UniV3, such as Baseline (from the creators of OHM), Arrakis Finance, Revert Finance, etc. However, none of them leverage this functionality to facilitate future cash flows for a bond-like ERC20 token, similar to the one we've developed.","In any marketplace, you have to accommodate the supply side before you can satisfy demand: before underwriting assets, you have to incentivise insurance capital. This is the motivation for our ""1 cent per day"" minting mechanism, which creates cohesion between the 4 top DeFi stablecoins: DAI, USDe, USDC, and FRAX. We also depend considerably on our integrations with Uniswap and Morpho on L1 from an economic standpoint. Inspired by our work, Kyber / Bprotocol are working on an Ethereum Magicians standard called ""ERC 777"" ","Milestone 1 will be remarked as the only other special 4pool on Ethereum besides Curve's. We see ourselves building on the output of our Milestone 2, evolving as a competitor to freelancehunt.com the number 1 talent platform in Ukraine. It will be possible to enter into co-founder agreements similarly to the way this is done on-chain through foundance.org The discounted token minting mechanism is re-set every 43 days, featuring a simple lottery mechanism to incentivise governance. We will announce the winners of this on a recurring X space, inviting guest speakers as we grow our customer community and content showcase.","As part of Milestone 2, escrow contracts must be deployed through a factory contract by service providers (e.g. freelancers of various kinds). A majority of these deployments will happen on Celo, and a significant portion of related communication (regarding customer success, etc.) will involve Celo community members as end-users, and us as facilitators.",[object Object],Galia Benartzi,"All relevant information about our milestones is outlined here: http://hackmd.io/@quid/mint For a very brief, and useful technical summary see our project README: http://github.com/QuidLabs/IMO",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,QU!D,"There are two milestones, one which is already built, and one which is half-built. The first one builds the pre-requisite foundation with two smart contracts: the ERC20 references the second contract as MO(Moulinette), a name paying homage to DAI's mom.sol as the contract that mounts everything else. We try to redeem Vitalik's meme: 85% green (solvent) tea (bill) and 15% wine (Y in...x * y = k); we based our tokenomics on this, like Tupac said, ""I'm trying to make a $ out of 15 cents."" Another core meme is the structure of the discounted token offering: 1 cent per day, exchanging % in a basket of stablecoins for future % gain in $, calculated through the minting discount.

Sarafu is also running on Celo. Integrated with Valora and its own USSD wallet that also works offline.","Goals and Objectives: The primary goal of this project is to establish a decentralised mutual credit system at Lukenya University, leveraging Celo’s cKES stablecoin to enhance educational access and financial resilience. The system will provide targeted credit for tuition, exam fees, and daily essentials, fostering a circular economy within the university. The project also aims to create a scalable, replicable model for other educational institutions.Key Objectives:Facilitate Credit Access: Enable low-income students to manage tuition and exam fees while supporting merchants for campus essentials. Promote Financial Resilience: Build a self-sustaining, revolving credit ecosystem backed by cKES. Develop a Scalable Framework: Create a model that can be replicated at other universities to enhance financial inclusion. Phase 1: Setup & Partnership Alignment (Weeks 1–2)Setup and allocate cKES to the mutual credit pool. Conduct baseline assessments to establish initial conditions for monitoring impact. Onboard merchants and students, providing training on Sarafu’s, Wallets and Sargo’s exchange platform. Deploy and test the technology stack to ensure seamless transaction processing. Phase 2: System Rollout & Credit Cycle Management (Weeks 2–12)Launch the mutual credit system, facilitating initial transactions for tuition, exam fees, and campus purchases. Monitor credit usage and adjust limits based on repayment performance to ensure sustainability. Publish blogs and develop University report (v1).Phase 3: Evaluation & Reporting (Weeks 13–14)Compile and analyse transaction data, repayment rates, and user feedback. Publish a detailed report and host a webinar to disseminate findings and scalability recommendations. Measurable Outcomes (Within 4 Months): Transaction Volume: Achieve at least 5,000 cKES and/or voucher transactions, demonstrating active engagement within the credit system by the end of the grant cycle (4 months). Community Engagement: Onboard 500 students and 20 merchants to the credit platform, fostering a thriving mutual credit ecosystem. Educational Impact: Enable students to access credit for tuition and exam fees, with a targeted repayment rate of 70% or higher. Blockchain Activity: Boost Celo network activity by recording all transactions on the blockchain, validating the use of cKES as a financial inclusion tool. Learning and Scalability: Document key learnings in 3 blog posts on Sargo and a research report authored by Lukenya University. Host a webinar to share insights with the Celo community and explore scaling opportunities.","Projections for the Idea Within the 4-month grant period, we project: 5,000 cKES-backed transactions 500 active student participants 20 engaged merchants Over the next 12 months, we expect the user base to grow by at least 50%, with potential for replication at other universities. The University has committed to managing the mutual credit system once the grant ends. Usage Expectations Transaction Volume: 5,000 transactions during the grant period, increasing to 10,000+  annually as the system scales beyond the grant. Community Engagement: Consistent usage by 500+ students and 30+ merchants within 12 months, fostering a robust credit ecosystem. Repayment Rates: Targeted repayment rate of 70-100%, ensuring fund sustainability and growth. Ongoing Costs There are no ongoing costs as the project will establish a revolving fund for continued mutual credit access. The fund will be replenished through participant repayments, creating a self-sustaining system. And the University has committed to managing the pool / program once the grants ends. This model also serves as a blueprint for other donors to contribute, expanding the credit pool and amplifying the project’s long-term impact. Staffing All staffing and operational support for the project will be provided by Lukenya University staff and students, who will oversee program delivery, monitoring, and reporting. This ensures that the project benefits from local expertise while minimising additional overhead costs. Potential Roadblocks and Mitigation Strategies Low Repayment Rates: Risk: Reduced repayment rates could limit the fund’s growth. Mitigation: Provide financial literacy training and incentivise timely repayments through benefits such as increased credit limits or discounts.  Provide merchants with the ability to de-risk by empowering them to choose recipients and loan size recipients. User Adoption Challenges: Risk: Slower adoption by students and merchants. Mitigation: We have already locked in support from students, merchants and the university. In addition we will launch targeted outreach campaigns, offer initial credit bonuses, and provide hands-on support through workshops and training sessions.Technological Issues: Risk: Potential downtime or integration challenges with Sarafu and Sargo platforms. Mitigation: Establish a dedicated technical support team and real-time system monitoring to quickly resolve any issues. Regulatory Changes: Risk: Changes in financial or blockchain regulations could affect operations. Mitigation: Maintain close communication with Bill Okyo (Kenyan Lawyer specialised in Web3) and adapt processes to ensure compliance. We have budgeted a small for this as part of this proposal. Additional Considerations Scalability: This project will serve as a model for other universities and educational institutions, demonstrating how mutual credit systems can promote financial inclusion. Donor Contributions: The revolving fund structure provides a sustainable model for other donors to expand the impact, increasing access to mutual credit and supporting broader educational goals. Data Insights: Transaction data will provide actionable insights, informing scalability and contributing to the growth of Celo’s ecosystem.","Deliverables and Benefits to the Celo Community At the end of the project, the Celo community will receive the following: Deployed Functional Credit System: A fully operational mutual credit system at Lukenya University, backed by cKES. The system will support 5,000 recorded transactions for educational and merchant services. And will continue to operate once the grant ends.  Final Report: A detailed report produced by the University documenting usage patterns, repayment rates (targeted 70% or higher), liquidity utilisation, and insights into the scalability of the system. This report will include actionable data for replicating and scaling similar systems in other educational or community settings. Testing and Demonstration of Micro-Swaps via Sargo: Demonstration of Sargo’s capability to handle micro-swaps as small as $0.50, enabling efficient and low-cost on/off-ramping. This feature supports Sarafu’s broader network by enhancing liquidity and expanding financial access, unlocking its full potential in underbanked areas. As such, once integrated, Sargo can benefit the other 60,000 Sarafu users. Increased Blockchain Activity: 5,000 transactions on the Celo blockchain, boosting adoption and showcasing cKES as a reliable liquidity tool in underserved areas. This number will grow to an estimated 10,000 transactions per year as the mutual credit program operates and grows. Blueprint for Celo-Based Mutual Credit Systems: A replicable, open-source framework for implementing university-centric mutual credit systems, which can be extended to other communities. Knowledge Sharing and Community Engagement: Three blog posts documenting key learnings, project milestones, and outcomes. A detailed end of project report by the University of Lukenya on impact, learning and next steps. A webinar and case study presentation to share the project’s success and engage the broader Celo and DeFi communities. Long-Term Benefits Strengthening the Celo Ecosystem: Increased stablecoin adoption and financial activity in real-world use cases, promoting trust in blockchain-based financial solutions. The fund will continue past the grant cycle, fuelling on-going transactions on the Celo network. Scalable Financial Inclusion Model: A proven, sustainable credit model for educational and community contexts, which can attract further contributions and expand impact across the Celo network. Unlocking Sarafu’s Full Potential: By leveraging Sargo’s micro-swap capabilities, the project maximises Sarafu’s efficiency, creating a robust financial system that benefits even the smallest-scale users.",No external investment. Previous support has come from grants for Sargo and validator income for Sarafu.,"No additional funding will be required after this grant due to the sustainable design of the Sarafu mutual credit system. Sarafu operates as a revolving credit model where the initial cKES funding is continually replenished by participant repayments as well as transaction fees. This self-sustaining structure allows each credit cycle—issued to students and merchants—to be paid back into the pool, enabling ongoing credit issuance without the need for further grants or external funding. However, additional donors are welcome to contribute to the pool in the future, which would enable more students to access University Vouchers and further enhance educational outcomes. The pool will be managed by a multi-sig managed by the University.","Without this grant, the program cannot launch, preventing crucial testing of a model designed to lower education and finance barriers via blockchain. The cKES-backed credit pool cannot be initiated, hindering credit access for university students and community merchants, and preventing validation of Sargo’s on/off-ramping capabilities for scale. Moreover, Sargo may not be able to support Sarafu in enabling low-cost micro-swaps, which are needed to fully unlock the power of the Sarafu Network. This lost opportunity would also mean missing key insights for replicable, decentralised credit in other educational settings.","Project Completion and Milestone Achievement To demonstrate the project’s progress and secure the release of the second $12,500 payment, we will provide the following deliverables as part of the First Tranche Deliverables. These deliverables will confirm that key milestones and initial KPIs have been met.

Continued expansion of voucher and cKES-based transactions on the Celo blockchain, driven by the ongoing operation and growth of the credit facility.","Yes, several blockchain-based projects offer mutual credit systems, decentralized finance (DeFi), and community credit solutions similar to ours. However, our project stands out due to its education-centric approach, specifically tailored for university ecosystems. Below is an analysis of comparable projects and the key differentiators that set our project apart.Comparable ProjectsGoodDollar and Circles UBI Similarities: Both GoodDollar and Circles UBI distribute universal basic income (UBI) via blockchain to promote financial inclusion.Key Differentiators:University-Focused Mutual Credit: Unlike Universal Basic Income (UBI), which relies on continuous external funding to provide regular payouts, the Sarafu mutual credit system is self-replenishing. It operates by recycling credit through loan repayments, ensuring a sustainable flow of funds without ongoing external support. Over time, community contributions and increased participation further expand the credit pool, fostering a resilient, self-sustaining financial ecosystem.Targeted Credit Allocation: Credit is allocated for specific needs such as tuition fees, exam costs, and campus supplies, ensuring efficient use of funds within the educational ecosystem. Sustainable Funding with cKES Stablecoin: By utilising Celo’s cKES stablecoin, the credit pool is replenished through repayments, reducing reliance on external funding sources and promoting sustainability. Trustlines Network Similarities: Trustlines offers peer-to-peer mutual credit systems, emphasising decentralisation and community resilience.Key Differentiators:Stable and Collateralised Credit Pool: Our system leverages the cKES stablecoin to minimise volatility, providing more predictable liquidity compared to Trustlines' non-collateralised approach. Ecosystem Integration: Embedded within universities like Lukenya, our credit system directly addresses local financial challenges, fostering resilience and building a localised, trusted economy within the educational sector. Micro-Transaction Support via Sargo: Sargo’s micro-swap functionality allows cash-outs as low as $0.50, making loan collateral accessible to merchants—a critical feature in educational settings where micro-transactions are common.Holochain Mutual Credit Similarities: Holochain supports mutual credit applications aimed at decentralised financial inclusion.Key Differentiators:Stablecoin Collateralisation: Unlike Holochain’s tokenless credit systems, our model uses the cKES stablecoin for predictable liquidity, which is crucial for meeting consistent financial obligations in education. University-Specific Use Case: While Holochain’s model is generic, our system is specifically tailored to universities, offering a scalable, education-focused credit framework. Micro-Transaction Support via Sargo: Sargo’s micro-swap functionality allows cash-outs as low as $0.50, making loan collateral accessible to merchants—a critical feature in educational settings where micro-transactions are common.Conclusion While projects like GoodDollar, Circles UBI, Trustlines, and Holochain offer decentralised credit solutions, our project uniquely combines stablecoin-backed revolving credit pools, a university-centric design, and micro-swap capabilities. This positions us as a sustainable and replicable model for fostering financial resilience in educational communities. By leveraging Sargo and Sarafu within the Celo ecosystem, we aim to create a transformative impact in the education sector, directly addressing the specific financial challenges faced by students, staff, and merchants in universities.","Yes, this proposal is unique in its dedicated focus on sustainable educational finance, building on the success of Sarafu, Africa’s leading blockchain-based mutual credit network with over $60 million in trade across underserved communities. This project leverages Sarafu’s expertise to create a robust, university-centred credit system tailored to the needs of students, university services, and local merchants. University-Centric Credit Network: Specifically designed for the educational sector, this model provides targeted credit for expenses such as tuition and campus essentials. Unlike UBI programs that offer unconditional grants, this system delivers needs-based, transactional credit aligned with the university community’s requirements. Celo Stablecoin-Backed Revolving Credit Pool: The cKES stablecoin on the Celo blockchain powers a revolving credit pool replenished through participant repayments, making it self-sustaining. This approach contrasts with UBI models that rely on continuous funding, ensuring stability and continuity without external support.Transactional Liquidity: This system creates a self-contained credit ecosystem within the university, enabling transactions specifically for educational expenses. This structure, with its emphasis on stable, internal liquidity, sets it apart from UBI models, which are not designed to operate as a revolving credit fund. Data-Driven Financial Insights: By collecting and analysing transaction volumes, repayment rates, and usage patterns, this project generates actionable insights that support future scalability and financial resilience within the educational sector. Replicable, Scalable Model for Educational Institutions: This project will establish a blueprint to be adapted and scaled across additional Universities.","Most listed competitors have minimal or non-specific reach in Africa: GoodDollar: Has some users in Africa, but lacks a focus on education or regional adaptation. Circles UBI: Limited presence in Africa, with no tailored applications for educational credit. Trustlines: No documented large-scale deployment in Africa, particularly within educational contexts. Holochain: Lacks established mutual credit networks within Africa. Sarafu’s Operations: Sarafu is the most established blockchain-based mutual credit system in Africa, with over $60 million in trade volume across underserved communities, particularly in Kenya. Recognised for partnerships with humanitarian organisations like the Red Cross and the World Food Programme, Sarafu brings extensive, region-specific experience in mutual credit that directly addresses local financial needs, including targeted educational credit.","Our project integrates cohesively with Celo’s ecosystem and aligns with Ethereum’s broader framework through:cKES-Backed Credit Network: Leveraging cKES, our project supports Celo’s financial inclusion goals, providing stable, accessible credit for community-driven needs, including educational expenses. This expands cKES utility, aligns with Celo’s L2 strategy, and promotes DeFi adoption.Blockchain Transparency for Trust: Using Celo’s blockchain to record issuance, transactions and repayments ensures transparency and trust. As Celo transitions to an L2 solution, we gain access to Ethereum’s tools, liquidity, and DeFi applications, enhancing interoperability and scalability.Enhanced Security and Low-Cost Transactions: Celo’s shift to an Ethereum L2 through the Optimism OP Stack anchors our credit data on Ethereum, enhancing security while keeping gas costs low through EigenDA off-chain data availability. This cost-efficient structure ensures our services remain accessible and affordable.Income: Sargo’s P2P exchange shares fees equally with merchants facilitating swaps, providing the Celo community with more active users for swaps and additional fee-earning opportunities.Data Insights for Ecosystem Growth: Our data on transaction volumes and credit usage offers valuable insights, supporting Celo’s data-driven financial empowerment and growth initiatives. Credit Collective: Sargo is already part of Credit Collective and will work with this community to amplify the impact and learning from this revolving credit program.","12 months, we expect our credit network to function independently, with repayments and transaction fees fully sustaining the pool, managed by a University multi-sig and team. We aim for an active user base of 500+ students and merchants, a reliable data collection framework, full Celo-L2 integration, and a replicable model poised for scaling.","To ensure active community engagement and transparency, we have a detailed plan to share progress, insights, and results with the Celo community and the broader DeFi ecosystem:

1) Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: We will engage with Celo Credit Collective and wider community by sharing blogs on Sargo and the Celo Forum and communication channels, fostering collaborative improvements and real-time input from the ecosystem.

2) Open-Source Code and Documentation: All non-proprietary code will be open-sourced with comprehensive documentation to support replicability. This allows other developers to access, review, and contribute to the project and helps communities implement similar models.

3) Community Events and Demonstrations: We will host a learning sessions at Kuneco or directly, providing a firsthand look at the platform’s functionality and impact. This will showcase the system's features, highlight participant benefits, and offer insights on setting up decentralised credit models in community contexts.

4) Final Report and Case Study: At the end of the launch, a detailed report / case study will be published through Celo’s channels, providing data on transaction volumes, repayment rates, and user feedback. This will highlight key learnings, challenges, and next steps for the mutual credit network established through this grant. The report will be produced by the University. 

5) Content Creation and Awareness: Three blog posts with visual content, and participant stories will share updates, key milestones, and outcomes, amplifying project visibility and inspiring similar initiatives will be made available on the Sargo and/or Sarafu.network websites.

This community-focused approach maximises transparency while providing valuable, replicable knowledge to the Celo ecosystem.

","Sarafu: A Proven Mutual Credit SystemSarafu is a well-established mutual credit system with a strong track record, including extensive implementations across Kenya and beyond. Highlighted in a Nature publication, Sarafu has facilitated over $60 million in trade volume and serves more than 60,000 users across Kenya.With funding from Prezenti, we aim to seed a sustainable mechanism that empowers communities to enhance educational access by establishing their own mutual credit networks. This approach enables families to afford educational resources and services through a community-supported credit system, fostering long-term economic resilience and self-sufficiency. The system is further strengthened by cKES stablecoin reserves, providing additional financial backing when necessary.Through Sargo, we reduce costs by facilitating the buying and selling of cKES held in the pool reserve, ensuring the mutual credit network remains accessible and sustainable. By implementing this solution in a university setting, we aim to create a replicable model that other communities can adopt, improving educational access in a sustainable and scalable way.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Enhancing Access to Education through University-Based Mutual Credit,"This project leverages Sarafu’s mutual credit system and Sargo’s decentralised exchange to establish a sustainable, blockchain-based credit model at Lukenya University, Kenya.

CELO's focus on mobile DEFI applications and stablecoin payments and BlackFrog's focus on emerging markets and sustainability, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, make the ecosystem a perfect fit. We believe that the transition to L2 and the necessary stablecoins are exactly the right time for us to enter the market on CELO. Our Team was on several in person CELO events and is networking within the ecosystem for years. We hope with CELO as a strong partner we can tokenize mineral commodities which are important for the energy tranistion such as cobalt and built innovative products on top like suistainable stablecoins backed by critical minerals.","BlackFrog usees the Grant to develop a RWA platform on CELO to leverage the tokenization of loans, bonds and mineral raw materials as Real World Assets (RWA). The platform aims to democratize access to finance and markets for small-scale miners while bringing the brand-new asset class of tokenized critical mineral raw materials on chain under applicable law.

If so, what roles?With the emergence of supply chain laws and CO2 taxes within the EU, companies in industrialized and developing countries are under great pressure to adapt.Problem Industrialized countries need access to critical raw materials such as cobalt, tin, tantalum and tungsten, which are mined in a responsible and environmentally friendly way to implement the energy transition in a responsible way.Problem Many of these critical raw materials for the energy transition are not mined in industrial mines but under poor conditions in small-scale mining. However, there is still no financing strategy for the market that will secure production and improve mining conditions in order to procure the raw materials that are so important for the energy transition.Problem Retail currently has no access to the asset class of critical raw materials. Tokenized commodities enable the retail sector to participate in this promising sector.BlackFrog enables financing in these assets and in the regions to improve conditions. This in turn leads to the secure and responsible procurement of critical raw materials. Tokenization would fundamentally democratize this market and enable retail to easily participate in the raw materials of the future.A final goal will be to launch critical raw material certificates similar to CO2 certificates on CELO, which simplifies the tracking overhead for industry and, on the other hand, supports the sector in emerging markets. We are talking to regulators in sub-Saharan Africa, including the UN, the ICGLR and other states, about critical mineral certificates and mineral tokenization.What are your usage expectations The current Small-Scale_mining market is $100bln a year, $14bln in sub-Saharan Africa. BlackFrog is operating within the countries with the highest production. We expect to tokenize several $100Mio up to 1$bln in critical minerals in the first year.Can you estimate your ongoing costsCan you estimate your ongoing costs Recurring costs include platform fees for licenses to enable STOs and a percentage of the volume of tokenized assets. With personnel and material costs included, the monthly costs amount to $50,000.Do you expect to hire in the next 6-18 months? If so, what roles?The future position will be mainly concerned with marketing and sales staff in order to generate enough deal flow through the site.What potential roadblocks do you envisage and how do you plan to mitigate against these?The tokenization of critical raw materials is clearly regulated so far and does not pose any risks in this respect.There are various types of risk associated with the pre-financing of critical raw materials, which are mainly due to weak state structures in the countries of origin, which means that contracts cannot always be enforced due to a weak judiciary. Accordingly, we plan to use a default fund to cover exceptional risks. In addition, we work with international experts in the auditing of pre-financing to guarantee a high quality of our deal flow. These include European authorities, industry associations and NGOs.","Critical raw materials are the focus for the energy transition. However, procurement and access are difficult to manage. BlackFrog has been working in sub-Saharan Africa for 4 years and has built a broad network of producers, traders and regulators to map the supply chain. With the tokenization of the assets, BlackFrog is not only creating the first decentralized commodity exchange but also giving users access to the coveted asset class by creating a new market. In addition, there is enormous potential for projects that want to build on this foundation. These include yield-bearing stablecoins based on critical raw materials that otherwise yield no interest, and the trade in CO2 and linked commodity certificates, which promise immense potential. The CELO network, which is very committed to sustainability, would gain an incredible USP in its ecosystem, which could also be used for marketing purposes, since the topic is and will become more and more important and is currently not on the radar.A significant part of the GDP of many African countries is the export of raw materials. The implementation of CELO wallets at the beginning of the value chain would shift the value creation directly to the CELO network and, above all, on-board CELO through the African society, which quickly adapts to mobile payments. This can accelerate CELO's existing plan in the mobile payment area for growth and penetration in the mobile payment area.","1 million has been raised so far€165,000 from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy€200,000 from the state development bank€600,000 from a business angelfurther grants and funding",We work closely with VCs and family offices which have great interest in critical mineral commodities.We are currently planning a raise in Q1 2025 in the amount of $2 million.,"A rejection of the grant would not jeopardize our project, but a grant would prove to us the commitment of the ecosystem to work together in the long term and on further development projects.","(see above @project plan milestone 4) With the completion of the project, users will be able to use CELO to buy regulatory-licensed and tokenized critical raw materials with stablecoins, as well as to participate in STOs for pre-financing.","The tokenization of commodities is carried out by various DApps. However, this is limited to the tokenization itself and not to the supply chain. 4 key points of BlackFrog USP: BlackFrog has access to the production of critical raw materials and can therefore offer higher varieties of critical raw materials. This direct access means that our procurement costs are lower than those of our competitors, making BlackFrog more competitive. BlackFrog operates in regulatory compliance from the EU, which creates trust with users.BlackFrog works with state regulators in the producing countries to implement comprehensive systems at the national level, including the digital collection of taxes (lock in).High level of expertise in the small-scale mining and critical minerals market","Innovative dapps make markets more efficient. truly unique startups create new markets. small-scale mining was an unregulated and very decentralized market and therefore a non-existent market. through new regulations, especially in African countries that have legalized small-scale mining because they see the potential for economic growth. On the other hand, industrialized and emerging nations are increasingly dependent on critical raw materials. This potential is being unlocked by our DAPP and creating new markets that have remained untouched to date. The significance in terms of politics, the economy and society is enormous and can become a foundation for the all-important energy transition.","Many start-ups are working on mapping supply chains using DLT. BlackFrog also started out as a tracking system. However, the realities on the ground have shown that tracking systems cannot be designed economically. Instead, the conditions at the sites should be improved. This can only be implemented by ESG and impact investors. In this way, a tracking system can be implemented for free , which ensures compliance with regulations but also creates trust for investments. Such a tracking system, which can be provided free of charge, will then scale the fastest. Currently, there are no solutions that solve the problem in this way, so we have pivoted to financing and tokenizing critical raw materials.","The EVM has proven itself over the years as a resilient infrastructure and has established itself at the institutional level. EVM is accepted by regulators, companies and banks which have licensed/regulated interfaces to the EVM for coming RWA or are developing them. Other L1s will not achieve this market penetration in the short term, giving ETH a clear first-mover advantage for reaching tradfi.CELO's focus on mobile-first DEFI infrastructure is a perfect match for our target group in developing countries, who do their banking on mobile and quickly adopt innovations. Furthermore, CELO's sustainable focus is important to us. Disruptive innovation should have a better world as its goal, and we at BlackFrog share the same view with our projects and personally. BlackFrog can not only use CELO's stablecoin infrastructure, but also bring forth new innovations in this area that benefit the entire ecosystem.","After a year, we want to be the largest mineral commodity tokenizer within DEFI and compare ourselves not with dapps but with established commodity exchanges.","Our Project did several pitches at conferences, meet ups and hackathons. We are able and willing to communicate openly, also in order to create our own community around our approach and brand. This also includes educating people about this market. We have published several blog posts and we are open to publishing further material on these topics.",[object Object],NDA,none,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,BlackFrog,"RWA launchpad for tokenized mineral raw materials needed for the energy transition such as cobalt, tin, tungsten and copper.

The initiated energy transition can only be achieved through a corresponding resource transition. The material intensity of renewable energies is 200-300% higher than that of energies from gas and coal. The increased demand cannot be met in the short term by industrial mining. Exploration, exploration and development of industrial mines can take up to 15 years. In addition, deglobalising economic and political factors make access to raw commodities more difficult. Global artisanal small-scale mining provides 15-20% of all extracted raw commodities each year, especially those identified as critical minerals for the energy transition. The number of people employed in artisanal small-scale mining has tripled since 1990 to 45 million. This figure represents 90 % of the total employment in the mining sector. Another 150 million are indirectly dependent on the sector. The sector turns over more than $100 billion a year and can offset excess demand in the short term through near-surface deposits. Artisanal small-scale mining is mostly informal and subject to international regulations that make it difficult for communities to market the raw commodities on world markets. BlackFrog enables compliance with international regulations and their marketing through a digital tracking system and also enables ESG and impact investments in the sector. This enables diversification of commodity sourcing and promotes a responsible energy transition.

In the following, we introduce BlackFrog and explain how we intend to deploy on CELO to achieve a responsible resource and energy transition while creating value for the economy and society by raising the potential of responsible small-scale mining.",https://x.com/BlackFrog_xyz,https://github.com/IotaOrigin,https://blackfrog.xyz/,0xeF1F0DD58a6B8A3287BA737269572090D1685611,"Julian Wikalinski (CEO),M.Sc.

With the grant, we can deliver a mature, well-supported launchpad that will directly contribute to Celo’s growth, adding long-term value as an accessible, public-good-style resource for all users","Our vision for PopCoin is to become the go-to launchpad for memecoins on Celo, fostering a vibrant community of creators and investors. With Celo’s commitment to accessible, inclusive finance, we anticipate PopCoin will attract diverse projects and a significant user base, especially as the popularity of community-driven tokens continues to rise.Usage Expectations:In the first year, we aim to support:100+ memecoin projects launched on PopCoin, leveraging the ease and low cost of launching on Celo.10,000+ users exploring, trading, and supporting memecoins within the PopCoin ecosystem, driven by our content marketing and community-building efforts.Community growth and engagement on platforms like Medium, Substack, and Celo’s own channels, as we publish educational content, tutorials, and regular updates.Estimated Ongoing Costs:With the current MVP as a starting point, we anticipate ongoing expenses in three primary areas:Platform Maintenance & Development – Approximately $1,000–$3,000 per month for continued feature enhancement, bug fixes, and contract upgrades.Community Engagement & Content – Estimated at $1,000–$2,500 per month for producing high-quality educational content, community support, and outreach.Security & Audits – $10,000  for third-party security audits to uphold user safety and trust in PopCoin’s smart contracts.Hiring Projections (Next 6–18 Months):To support PopCoin’s growth, we anticipate hiring:Frontend Developer – To expand the platform’s features and improve UX.Community Manager – To oversee engagement, manage user queries, and grow our community across social platforms.Content Creator – To regularly produce educational and promotional materials that help drive adoption.Potential Roadblocks and Mitigation Strategies:User Trust and Security – Maintaining trust is essential for a launchpad, so we will prioritize comprehensive audits and open-source transparency to reduce security risks. Regular updates and clear documentation will help mitigate any concerns.Market Volatility and Adoption – Given that crypto markets can be unpredictable, we’ll remain adaptable, continuously improving PopCoin’s offerings to align with user demand and market trends.Community Growth – Building an engaged community can be challenging in a competitive landscape. To address this, we’ll invest in educational content and interactive events, leveraging Celo’s existing community networks to reach more users.Regulatory Landscape – As regulation in the crypto space evolves, we will stay informed on compliance requirements and adjust our platform to align with any relevant laws or guidelines.","At the completion of PopCoin’s development and launch on mainnet, the Celo community gains a fully open-source, user-friendly launchpad dedicated to memecoin projects. This resource will not only empower creators to launch community-driven tokens on Celo with ease, but it will also provide a new avenue for user engagement, promoting decentralized finance and expanding Celo’s reach in the crypto space.Key Benefits and Features: An Accessible Memecoin Launchpad – PopCoin will simplify the process of launching memecoins, making it accessible to creators of all levels. This will bring a new wave of projects to Celo, reinforcing it as a home for innovative, community-centered initiatives.Open-Source Codebase – By making PopCoin open-source, we are giving back to the Celo ecosystem a resource that developers can learn from, contribute to, and repurpose, strengthening the collaborative spirit of Celo’s community.Enhanced Ecosystem Activity and User Engagement – PopCoin will drive engagement by drawing in creators, traders, and new users interested in supporting or exploring memecoins. This increased activity will bolster Celo’s transaction volume, liquidity, and overall network effect.Educational and Onboarding Resources – PopCoin will produce a wealth of educational content aimed at onboarding newcomers to Celo and DeFi, supporting community growth and helping users navigate the world of decentralized finance on Celo.Secure and Community-Driven Platform – With regular audits and transparent documentationIn Summary , What PopCoin Will Do: Enable Anyone to Launch and Manage Memecoins – any user will be able to mint, list, and manage their memecoins directly on Celo. Support Liquidity and Growth for New Tokens – We will provide tools for creators to drive liquidity and grow their projects within the Celo ecosystem. Foster Community Interaction and Awareness – PopCoin will actively engage the Celo community with updates, guides, and user-driven feedback channels, making it a hub for collaboration and discovery.","No, No investment","Community Grants and Partnerships – We plan to apply for further community-focused grants or partnerships, potentially from other aligned organizations within the DeFi and blockchain space, to help sustain and grow PopCoin.Revenue from Platform Fees – We charge a trading fee on every transaction and we aim to grow trades on the platform such that income from the trading fees are a significant souce.","Well, Our commitment to building PopCoin as an accessible launchpad for community-driven tokens on Celo remains strong, regardless of any outcome. While receiving the grant would be great and would go a long way in accelerating our timeline and enable us to launch with additional features and security measures, we have a contingency plan to continue development through alternative avenues. We will considerScaled-Down MVP Launch Alternative Funding SourcesOpen-Source Community ContributionsUltimately, while the grant would help us launch a more robust version of PopCoin sooner, we’re dedicated to finding a path forward to deliver PopCoin as a resource for the community.",An Open source published work deployed on the Celo Chain,"Yes, pump.fun inspired this idea, but pump.fun and launchpads on other chains often impose high fees or complex onboarding, limiting accessibility for smaller creators, and are also mostly focused on larger ecosystems. Our Unique Value on Celo:Affordable and Accessible – Built on Celo, PopCoin offers low-cost entry, making it accessible to creators with limited resources, unlike many other launchpads. We plan to charge minimal fees , to align with the low fees culture on CELOAligned with Celo’s Financial Inclusion Mission – PopCoin supports financially inclusive, community-oriented projects, making it a unique fit for the Celo ecosystem.","While PopCoin is not entirely unique in the broader blockchain landscape, it will be the first memecoin launchpad on the Celo ecosystem. This distinction allows us to fill a significant gap within Celo, providing a dedicated platform for creators looking to launch memecoins.","Yes, there are several protocols and services in the memecoin and launchpad space, primarily on other blockchains such as Ethereum , Solana (e.g., Pump.fun) and Binance Smart Chain. These platforms allow users to create and launch memecoins but often come with higher fees and complex processes that can deter smaller creators.We have thoroughly researched existing platforms and we believe that PopCoin’s first-mover advantage on Celo,  and our focus on affordability and community supportcan  create a tangible difference in how we approach the memecoin launchpad concept.","PopCoin is designed to be a cohesive and synergistic addition to the Celo ecosystem, aligning closely with Celo's mission of promoting financial inclusion and accessibility while also integrating with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.PopCoin already has built in support for multiple DEXes , and can easily integrate with different DEXes on Celo.We will also explore cross-chain collaborations, enabling memecoin projects launched on Celo to engage with the wider DeFi and NFT ecosystems on Ethereum, thus broadening their reach.Additionally, we are also hoping to get integrated with minipay attracting memecoin enthusaists to the minipay ecosystem and vice versa","in 12 months, we hope PopCoin will have been recognized as a key player in the Celo ecosystem, contributing to Celo's  growth and attracting several new users to the ecosystem. Our efforts will help promote financial inclusion, encouraging participation from different communities and enhancing the overall ecosystem.We anticipate a vibrant community of creators and tradrs engaging with the platform, having successfully launched multiple memecoin projects. This user base will contribute to an active marketplace where new and established memecoins thrive.Lastly, we hope PopCoin will have established partnerships with other projects and protocols within the Celo and broader Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating cross-chain functionalities and enabling memecoins launched on PopCoin to access new markets and audience","We will prioritize engaging the Celo community to share our progress, insights, and innovations from the PopCoin project. Our plan includes:

Demonstration Sessions: We plan to host virtual demonstration sessions to showcase PopCoin's features and user success stories. These sessions will be open to all community members and will provide an interactive platform for Comments, feedback and suggestions.

Participation in Celo Events: We aim to actively participate in Celo-related events, such as Kuneco and other conferences. We are considering organizing presentations(virtual and maybe physical) and workshops to demonstrate PopCoin’s functionalities, gather community input, and strengthen our network.

Blogs and Articles: We will also create blog posts and technical articles detailing our development process, user experiences, and key lessons learned.  This will be published on platforms like Medium and Substack.

BitGifty is a crypto gifting product for daily lifestyle. BitGifty is creating an ecosystem where Africans can interact with web2 products using simplified web3 payment system. BitGifty is simply enabling crypto for real world applications.,"In the past, we have built our crypto gifting infrastructure which allows users to send and receive crypto as gift cards.We also built a 'spend' product that allows crypto users to spend their crypto on payments and bills in their daily lives. Payments and bills like airtime, electricity, grocery shopping, cable TV, sports betting top-up, airtime, and data.We have also integrated BitGifty on Minipay and have gone live in five countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.See -bitgifty.comBitGifty on MinipayEnterprise BitGifty",Africa,"Celo Camp,Africa DAO,Other,Celo Public Goods,Minipay","BitGifty was the winner of the Celo camp s8. Not only did BitGifty win the Celo camp, we also got the opportunity to integrate on Minipay.Since getting into the Celo ecosystem and making great strides with BitGifty, I have contributed as a mentor in the CeloIncuba and Celo Africa DAO incubator/accelerator program.BitGigfty also ranks top 10 in the Celo public goods.","Goals for the Prezenti Growth Pool GrantAs requested by BitGifty users, We aim to enhance interoperability between web3 and web2 gift cards by offering a marketplace for the sale of web2 gift cards on Minipay. The web2 gift card industry in Africa is a billion-dollar market. We aim to not only provide interoperability with local SMEs' web2 gift cards but also global gift cards like iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, and many others making this a global product.Create a Gamehub (BGT points system) to increase retention and engagement with the Minipay BitGifty platform. This is aimed at engaging Minipay users who do not yet have funds to interact or those who are not too familiar (or scared) with crypto. The points system will have these users accumulate BGT points by participating in activities and then earning points which they can use to buy airtime/data making these users potential spenders.  Go live in five other countries to enable bill payment - Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.Steps to Achieve Goals1.1 Complete conversations with the chosen partner, and sign the agreement (we already found an appropriate partner to work with) 1.2 Create wireframe for Gift Card Marketplace UI.1.3 Deposit into the wallet, Start building.1.4 Test in Staging 1.4 Go live on MinipayTimeline = 3 weeks2.1 Create wireframe for points system and game hub UI.2.2 Build the infrastructure2.3 Test in Staging2.4 Go live on Minipay2.5 Track and receive feedback from usersTimeline = 4 weeks3.1 Partners with local providers in these target countries to partner with (conversations already ongoing). 3.2 Build and interact with local providers API.3.3 Test in Staging3.8 Go live on MinipayTimeline = 4 weeks","As BitGifty currently does around 50,000 transactions MoM from 5 active countries, we estimate at least a 200% (2x) increase in transaction quantity.This might seem far fetched but here's why we think so - Considering that this growth build was based on the request of many of our users, we project that the web2 gift card products would be available to Minipay users globally. This opens up BitGifty beyond the shores of Africa.Our launch in 5 new countries also opens BitGifty to more Minipay users in these countries.The BGT points would gain a lot of traction as users who don't have funds in their Minipay wallet can play games and participate in quests to earn points which they can eventually use to pay bills. This might not immediately result in more paying users but would increase the engagement on Minipay. Our ongoing costs still remains about 2300 USD per month.We recently hired an additional frontend developer and will be hiring an additional blockchain developer and backend developer within the next few months.Our potential roadblock is finding good providers to launch several bill payments in these countries. Due to this, for the completion of the grant, we will launch at least Airtime and Data in these 5 countries while seeking continuous partnerships with other web2 companies (product used on daily basis) beyond just bill payments.","At the end of the development, the Celo ecosystem and Minipay users will be able to buy local and global web2 gift cards on their Minipay. This will enhance the interoperability between the Celo ecosystem and the billion-dollar web2 gift card industry. Our bill payment product would also be made available to Minipay users in five more African countries giving them a way to spend their crypto.The BGT game hub and points system will help onboard  lots of Africans into the Celo ecosystem making them potential users.",No,We are still speaking with Verda Ventures and we have a chance of getting funded soon.,"We hope to get the grant as this will help us build faster however, if we do not get it, we will continue with the integrations but might take longer.","Deployment of a live marketplace for web2 gift cards on Minipay.Deployment of a live bill payment feature (at least Airtime and Data) for the Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe markets on Minipay. The code will be Open source.Deployment of a Gamehub and BGT point system on Minipay.","Bitrefill.com would be considered a competitor. However, Bitrefill only offers the sale of web2 gift cards and payment with crypto. On the other hand, BitGifty not only aims to offer web2 gift cards but will be directly integrating with these web2 products to offer their products/services directly on BitGifty.","Yes.We built a crypto gifting infrastructure to reduce the barrier of entry into the crypto space especially in Africa where crypto education is low and people are familiar with web2 gift cards.And then after getting the crypto seamlessly, we have the spend platform where crypto users can easily spend their crypto. While other platforms focus on offramp, we feel that defeats the purpose of crypto, and crypto should be spent in place of fiat. We hope to reduce offramp and keep the liquidity circulation in crypto.",No,BitGifty being a Celo public good project with a good portion of its code open source aligns well with the Ethereum Values pillar.The BitGifty token which will be launched within the next 12 months would also adopt the ERC-20 token standard.,"In 12 months time, we believe we would have launched BitGifty gifting token, the first gifting token within the Celo ecosystem. BitGifty will be actively bridging web2 utilities and businesses with seamless web3 payment. BitGifty will be live beyond the shores of Africa, especially in LATAM.","We'd run a demo at any Celo event we are privileged to attend

Through the chamas users save together and also are able to lend each other money in the chamas. This has been a very great instrument to understand how our target market (low income earners with little knowledge of crypto) onboard, interact and utilize a web3 product. So far through the MVP Clixpesa has onboarded over 53 chamas with over 400 active users, disbursed 296 loans to members in the chamas. This has been a good measure of how our product is utilized and improvements needed.",Africa,"Celo Camp,Africa DAO,Celo Foundation,Minipay","Clixpesa through its Co-founders Derrick and Samuel has been involved actively in the Celo ecosystem since its inception in the Build with Celo hackathon of 2022. We have actively participated in Kenya's Celo code jams, interacting with fellow builders and upcoming devs seeking to build on Celo. We have participated as judges in some code jams and Derrick has also mentored various teams in the 2024 series of Build with Celo hackathons. At Celo camp, after being and alumni of 3 cohorts, Derrick has also mentored teams in Celo camp and a good success has been Pretium (https://pretium.africa) which has seen rapid adoption on Minipay.","Clixpesa has had a good run on its MVP this year while developing some good foundation on the actual use and impact of our offering. For this round we plan to use the 4 months to have  ROSCAs (Clixpesa Spaces) product improvements, introduce an overdraft facility for individual users and capacity building for our chamas. Deliverable ListAssuming this phase begins on 16th Dec 2024ROSCAs / Clixpesa Spaces Smart contract Improvement. Clixpesa spaces is Clixpesa's saving products for both groups and individuals. The groups can be both informal groups and ROSCAs. In our MVP these groups exist as individual multi-sig contracts deployed on Celo whenever a user creates a space. While this gave users ultimate control on their spaces, it has been a nightmare to manage especially whenever we need to upgrade their functionality. For this reason we seek to change this to a single contract with different roles assigned to group managers, members and creators of such spaces. Success Criteria: Users can create spaces as before and receive different roles to manage these spaces. Clixpesa can demonstrate upgradability of this contract and successful migration with all space information intact for users. Timeline: Will take about 2 weeks to be completed. Will start working on this from the beginning of the project. 1 week after 15th and the continue after the holidays. Budget: $5,800EDC: 10th January 20252. Overdraft Facility / Clixpesa Jazisha Clixpesa has managed to test out its peer to peer lending product within the chamas. The average loan amounts to every individual are about Ksh. 9000 ($70). These loans are mostly used directly to pay for goods and services by these users. Users repay these loans in a very short time and again request to continue with another purchase. This forms a very good basis to have a product in our wallet that can allow users to overdraw their wallet for amounts up to $100. Users can be charged a lower interest for this than a normal loan and therefore increase the volume of spend among our users. Once the user tops up their wallet, they can repay this and have their $100 limit replenished for another transaction. An example for this scenario is say one wants to spend 8500 cKES but they only have 5000 cKES, their wallet will be topped up with 3500 cKES and have them successfully complete the transaction. This way, the user can skip a formal loan request once they are subscribed to this product. Success Criteria: App demo with a payment direct to an Mpesa merchant account or another wallet with less balance and have a successful payment. Timeline:  Will take 10 days (about 1 and a half weeks) to be completed. Will start working after 1st milestoneBudget: $5,500EDC: 22nd January 20253. Mobile app integration with the new smart contractsThe improved Spaces contracts and the new Jazisha contracts will be integrated into Clixpesa's UI. Currently Clixpesa is already improving its mobile UI factoring in most of the user feedback we have gathered from our users this year. Success Criteria: App demo with smart contracts transactions as proof of work. Also demonstrate to select users and gather feedback on the Jazisha product. Timeline: Will take 10 days (about 1 and a half weeks) to be completed. Will start working after 20th January.Budget: $2,700EDC: 31st January 20254. Clixpesa smart contracts and partner protocols indexingAt Clixpesa we have been utilizing firebase as a backend service and with this, we have quickly learned that it has great limitations as our user base grows and may hinder our scalability. Most of the data is spread between contracts and backend services on firebase which are not properly indexed. We therefore seek to upgrade our stack to a dedicated VPS and have the backend fully integrated to properly index our smart contracts and those of our partners in the ecosystem. A proper indexing setup will ensure one source of truth across our products and those that we share with our partners. Success Criteria: Demonstrate data as being indexed directly from the smart contracts that we consume and with only very limited information being added from the frontend or UI. Timeline: This will take 3 weeks as it might collide with our phase III of ROSCA engagement and loan collections. Work will start 3rd FebruaryBudget: $4,500EDC: 25th February 20255. Integration review and security auditWith this substantial improvements and changes made to the stack, there is need to ensure that all is well tested and audited for any security risks. We shall conduct  full end to end audit with the help of our audit partner. Success Criteria: Integration review and security audit of mobile app in relation to smart contract interactionsTimeline: Will take 2 weeks. Work starts after Milestone 4 completion. Budget: $3,500EDC: 14th March 20256. Audit Reconciliation, deployment and releaseReaction to any audit issues both on the app and smart contracts. After corrections app deployment to app store for users to update.Success Criteria: Finalized app demo and deployment with update alerts and invitation links. In order to drive adoption and discovery of our Jazisha overdraft facility we shall reserve $500 in cKES rewards for our users.Timeline: Will take 5 days to be completed. Work starts after completion of milestone 5.Budget: $3,000EDC: 22nd March 2025","ProjectionsOur MVP is currently restricted in select areas in Nairobi, however from February 2025 we plan to role out fully in Kenya. With this we expect to onboard 300 to 500 chamas with a user base of at least 5,000 users. With the Jazisha product we aim to move loan requirements of less than $100 to the overdraft facility and have chamas be evaluated for loans above $100 per member. This gives as a potential to disburse up to $500,000 in loans.Usage expectationsWith the current target user Clixpesa has attracted thus far, we expect traders with inventory needs of less than $100 a day will use the overdraft facility. This consist of about 70% of our users so far. With no application process need to get the account overdrawn this users can quickly purchase inventory or supplement their kiosks whenever needed. For larger loans, user will utilize their chamas for needs like business capital or substantial renovations. This will be easier to process given the social reputation in the chamas and chamas can as well use part of their savings as collateral. Estimated on going costsInfrastructure costOn infrastructure, we subscribe to firebase functions, auth and firestore which bring about a monthly recurring bill of <$10. To KYC our users we pay Ksh25 ($0.2) per user. After onboarding in order to create the base score of the user, we evaluate their Mobile money transactions at $3 per user, this helps us get the right amount for the user to borrow in order to reduce the risk of default. For our on and offramp services on Kenya's mobile money networks, users are charged 1% for off ramping and 0.5% for on ramping. We subsidize the onramp fees so the user can have their full amount in the wallet whenever they onramp.  2. Onboarding costsDuring the MVP most of the onboarding as been done on premise where we visit the chamas during their meetings and help the user onboard. Most of this uses barely have any data, so we provide data and also reward each user with 25 cKES for successfully onboarding and joining their Chama in the app. Estimated cost  for logistics is $50 a day. In our next phase we plan to stop face to face onboarding as most of the issues that required our presence have been handled either in app or through offering remote support. 3. Running costsThese include renting office space, internet and utilities are estimated at $1000 monthly. HiringYes, we expect to expand our team in the coming months. We will be expanding our backend, frontend, and operations team and also looking for a product designer.Potential RoadblocksAdapting the new smart contract might change the way our users are already used to using the Chama feature and navigating around it. This means we will have to have another round of outreach to educate our users on the new changes. We also plan to prepare demo videos and share in their social groups as well. Anything elseOur recent success with running the MVP with other ecosystem partners has showcased our ability to deliver for our community. Clixpesa is taking shape albeit in at slow pace as we are figuring out the most efficient way of distribution and onboarding. Clixpesa is also considering to evaluate HaloFi's model and explore what potential their approach had in our community when it comes to savings. We are confident that our experience will enable shape our product in the best form that our current market will adopt easily and deliver substantial value to the ecosystem.","The Celo community gets an easy to use protocol for ROSCAs management. Devs on Celo can build on top of our contracts and have ROSCA platforms as well. Clixpesa was the 1st product to adopt the Celo Kenyan shilling, and will continue to push the utilization of cKES in our product through its partnerships with Mento. Our wallet through the Jazisha offering will enable users to complete transactions on Celo without worrying about their available balance.",No. Clixpesa has come thus far through grants from the Celo foundation and Prezenti.,We are in the process of consolidating requirements to have a successful pre-seed round in Q1 of 2025.,"We will keep building and since Clixpesa is a very lean team, we will shoot for more revenue through our partners and continue to survive on revenue share as we are currently setup until our pre-seed round.",A demo of our updated application will be share from one of chama members to demonstrate the new functionalities. Our final milestone would disbursement of loans to at least 2 ROSCAs through the new contracts after deployment (since the chamas already have ongoing loans) and proof of overdraft utilization from contract transactions. Our work has always been open sourced and this a release of the app will shared on our repo as well.,"We are yet to see any successful implementations of our spaces model and P2P uncollateralized loans. Our partner, who would been a good competitor for groups focuses more on financing the loans and building a reputation for these groups. We however view them as a peer lender like will be other institutions we will onboard to provide liquidity to our P2P lending products.","We believe we are the 1st to bring the utility of ROSCAs to web3. however this idea does exist off-chain as chama management platforms and digital lending platforms. Our product compliments the current landscape by connecting highly liquid institutions, ROSCAs and individuals to users who need loans.","There exist multiple web2 solutions in Kenya and the rest of Africa trying to offer chama management solutions, however these are plagued with lack of transparency that a blockchain implementation offers. furthermore as we are leveraging the blockchain, transactions fees within Clixpesa are near zero hence giving the users a piece of mind utilizing the product without a worry of any hidden fees.","Clixpesa has from the very beginning built its foundation on the philosophy of the Celo mission to build for prosperity. Clixpesa contributes to financial inclusion by onboarding those who have been sidelined and solely rely on ROSCA setups to stay financially resilient. With Celo moving to the broader Ethereum ecosystem, we intend to leverage other protocols such as Uniswap and yield farming protocols in the wider ecosystem to generate yield for user who save on our platform.","Clixpesa is growing but steadily. We expect to have rapid growth from Q2 of 2025 by adding more partners to provide liquidity for P2P loans and overdraft facilities, on and off ramp partners to help us expand to other markets in East and Central Africa and finally having a broad distribution of our product to IOS users and a universal app for web only users. We also anticipate integration of our protocols in other dapps. Clixpesa is also shooting for 50,000 users by the end of 2025 through our upcoming campaigns ""Sababisha na Clixpesa"" and ""#ZeroFeeClix"" ","While Clixpesa has been working a lot in stealth, this has been to ensure that we have most of our core features right. However, with our upcoming campaigns, Clixpesa will have extensive socializing and communication to the Celo community and our target users as well. So far Clixpesa is known to appear in many Kenya ecosystem events and setups and has been active in the community.
We are also planning to collaborate more with Mento in the cKES campaigns as we help drive adoption of the local stable token.

We are currently building a tree planting integration with MiniPay.Silvi is deeply embedded in Celo’s regenerative finance ecosystem, actively advancing Celo’s mission of carbon neutrality and environmental impact. Our tree-planting and impact-tracking platform contributes directly to Celo’s public goods objectives by using blockchain to create measurable, verifiable environmental outcomes. In addition to our achievements through programs like Gitcoin Climate and MaEarth rounds and recognition at Celo Camp, our foundational infrastructure operates on Celo: all of Silvi’s smart contracts are deployed on Celo, and our plant-to-earn campaigns have exclusively run in cUSD. This strategic alignment enhances accessibility and impact within the Celo network, reinforcing our commitment to Celo’s regenerative finance goals.","Goals: We aim to expand Celo’s carbon offsetting initiatives into nature by dedicating 20% of the Carbon Offset Fund (housed inside UltraGreen Money initiative) specifically to tree planting efforts. The Prezenti grant could help us build the necessary tools and integrations to be able expand UltraGreen Money's fund accordingly.  More about Celo's UltraGreen Money can be found here:https://www.ultragreen.money/https://blog.celo.org/ultragreen-money-c677e7508abbhttps://forum.celo.org/t/updates-on-ultragreen-money-celo-carbon-offset-fund/7422/2Celo has seen substantial month-over-month expansion in transaction volume. Based on the past three months' transaction data and an average transaction fee of $0.000913 per transaction: Total Transaction Fees (Past 3 Months): Approximately $51,000 20% of Total Transaction Fees towards carbon fund: Around $10,200 (Proposed) 20% of Carbon Fund Fees towards trees: $2,040 (current rate)This amount could be allocated from the UltraGreen Fund towards Silvi's tree-planting initiatives, enabling Silvi to plant thousands of trees per year. Further, Celo's UltraGreen Money has achieved over 20x offset (compared to it's footprint, while accumulating 20,000 of unused CELO in the fund as per https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqKs_iCc-6ZHMmEKHkmjFFr5PjcqAds278h8syO6NY/edit?gid=1313863579#gid=1313863579). This means that the fund offers an untapped opportunity to expand UltraGreen Money's impact into other green assets, particularly in Nature. By aligning our efforts with Celo’s regenerative vision, we intend to develop an interconnected system that both plants trees and provides verifiable impact data, enhancing the biodiversity of Celo’s nature investments all while subsidizing user acquisition. Integrating tree planting with Silvi offers Celo the opportunity to fund regeneration natively, with a dApp built in the Celo ecosystem rather than carbon credits originated externally.Our project plan includes: -Creating a Tree-Planting Pool: Configuring a designated pool funded by Celo’s UltraGreen Fund, in order to propose allocating 20% of the the accumulated and recurring Carbon Offset Fund allocated to Silvi’s MRV powered tree planting initiatives. -API and Heatmap Integration: Developing a robust API and collaborating with the team behind UltraGreen Money’s website to integrate Silvi’s tree data into the existing impact heat map, allowing users to view Celo-funded tree planting efforts on a global scale. Launch of a Dashboard Widget: Creating an interactive dashboard widget for Celo’s UltraGreen Money landing page, where users can access detailed information about Silvi’s methodologies, goals, and ongoing progress in real-time, alongside Celo’s existing offset data. Project steps: Here’s a breakdown of integrating Silvi’s tree-planting feature within the Celo ecosystem as a native regeneration solution:Designing the Silvi Tree-Planting Protocol for Celo -Protocol Specifications: Outline the technical parameters for the tree-planting protocol, including dMRV requirements, smart contract interactions, and expected user interactions. -Environmental Impact Metrics: Define the metrics to be tracked, such as number of trees planted, survival rates, carbon sequestration estimates, biodiversity impact, and geographical spread. 2.Developing the Core dApp Infrastructure -Smart Contract Development: Build and deploy smart contracts to allocate funds, track spending, and record impact data for reforestation efforts. -API and Data Integration: Design APIs to integrate external data sources and track tree-planting activities, with real-time updates to Celo’s UltraGreen Money interface.3.User Interface Design and Implementation -Dashboard Creation: Develop an intuitive dashboard within the dApp for users to visualize reforestation impact, transaction history, and live updates on planted trees. -Heatmap and Interactive Map: Implement a map that shows the geographic distribution of planted trees, using real-time data from the Silvi platform.4.Data Verification and Environmental Reporting -dMRV Integration: Embed dMRV functionality within the dApp, ensuring each tree planting effort is verified and reported transparently. -On-Chain Data Tracking: Log and update all relevant metrics (e.g., growth, carbon offset potential) on-chain to provide immutable impact records. -Real-Time Reporting on UltraGreen Money: Integrate the reporting feed with Celo’s UltraGreen Money landing page, providing continuous updates on reforestation progress.5.Pilot Launch and Iteration -Pilot Program Implementation: Allocate a small amount to run a pilot to track results and data interoperability. User Testing and Feedback: Gather feedback from initial users and adjust features, user flow, and reporting metrics as needed. Scaling the Program: Based on pilot success, expand the tree-planting efforts and introduce new features to improve impact and user engagement.Expected Outcomes by Q2 2025:-Fully Operational Tree-Planting Module: An on-chain module that manages and allocates tree-planting funds from Celo’s UltraGreen Fund, utilizing Silvi’s MRV for transparency and verification. -Accessible Impact Visualization: Public access to real-time, transparent data on tree planting efforts via an integrated heatmap and dashboard, allowing the Celo community to engage with and track funded impact projects. -Initial Global Deployment of Trees: Successful deployment of tree-planting projects across multiple global sites, supported by detailed impact reports that outline growth, biodiversity metrics, and environmental outcomes.","Projections:We expect to plant and track 10,000 trees globally, within the first year of using funds from Celo’s UltraGreen Money. While this grant specifically will not deploy a lot of funding towards tree planting, in parallel to the Prezenti grant, we will be posting a forum proposal to assign 20% from the carbon fund and have already received support from cLabs team. This grant will allow us to build out the integrations that would make that possible, and as a result, to achieve the impact stated above within the first year.Usage expectations:The UltraGreen Trees integration will drive Celo user adoption by subsidizing user acquisition through tree planting, as well as market Celo’s mission to create a sustainable financial ecosystem. By showcasing the potential of smart contracts on Celo for real-time environmental impact, it will set a new standard in transparent, on-chain offsetting and biodiversity reporting. This project will also serve as a powerful signal to other organizations, demonstrating how blockchain can advance climate and nature goals through ReFi with accountability and transparency. Ongoing costs:If this initial phase is successful, we see the opportunity to expand the program, which would pursue development and require ongoing funding, primarily covered by future grants and partnerships. We plan to kickstart this project with this grant, but we will put a proposal on the forum as well to further develop the UltraGreen Trees platform into higher fidelity data reporting. We expect some of the data reporting, methodologies used and impact assessment to improve over time without any direct additional cost to CELO as this is something Silvi is continuously improving independently of CELO. However, we have longer term visions for UltraGreenTrees that might require more sophisticated collateralization efforts into nature-based assets, which we see as an evolution of this first step. Examples of that might include certifying carbon sequestration or biodiversity credits which would not be a focus in this first step.Hiring expectations:Yes, we plan to allocate design, engineering and consulting time from the Silvi team and from external members towards this as well as work closely with the Celo team to integrate directly in the UltraGreenMoney website over the course of the  next 4-6 months to support the project’s growth. Potential roadblocks:There are inherent challenges in scaling tree planting efforts, ensuring survivability and accurate data reporting. However, we are well positioned to address these issue and have built an entire MRV system that mitigates these risks. Further, we have a track record of reforestation organizations and partners doing impressive work that","The Celo community will gain a robust, transparent, and verifiable on-chain system that funds and tracks global reforestation efforts in real time. By integrating the UltraGreen Trees module, Celo’s UltraGreen Fund will go beyond carbon offsetting to actively support tree planting, which users can monitor through an accessible dashboard and global heatmap. This will empower the Celo community to see the direct environmental impact of their transactions as they help restore ecosystems worldwide. Through the module’s integration on Celo’s UltraGreen Money landing page, users can access detailed data on reforestation progress, methodologies, and impact metrics, making environmental restoration a visible, trackable outcome of their participation in the Celo network. Ultimately, the UltraGreen Trees module will transform Celo’s sustainability efforts into an actionable, measurable contribution to nature, positioning Celo as a blockchain leading ecological restoration and inspiring broader community engagement in environmental initiatives.","We have received 14 grants to date to build Silvi to where it is. We have been entirely grant funded without any equity investments. We have received grants such as from Gitcoin Climate and Ma Earth Grants, Climate Collective and Filecoin Green. Many of our MRV tools for this project have been built out. However, we have not received funding directly to build out the integrations needed for the Ultragreen Trees","We constantly perform well on Gitcoin Grants and still have a runway of Filecoin grants. Further, we have started to collect revenue from CLients doing regeneration. We expect to continue trending upwards, which has allowed us to grow our team to its current size of 11. The prezenti grant would be exclusively used to build out this integration and wouldn't require additional funding. That is not to say that if it goes well, we won't continue to build out the integration. Further, we intend to finally launch a token around mid 2025",We will continue on our product development roadmap which is well defined for the next 4-6 months,"Our final milestone is to show the complete data integration via APIs into the dashboard widget and UltraGreen Tree's graph showing the number of trees planted by CELO. Further, this data will have nested links for full transparency",Not that we are familiar with.,"This is very unique to the mission of Celo and Silvi.When Celo launched The Climate Collective, it mentioned wanted to tokenize trees and add it to the Celo reserve, so that stable coins be backed by nature-based RWAs (https://blog.celo.org/introducing-the-celo-climate-collective-6f056f190a04)Silvi's mission is to help plant and steward 1 trillion trees and help restore the natural planet.While trees as an asset class is still not mainstream, the Ultragreens Money carbon fund serves as the perfect opportunity to push this dream closer to reality. Currently, the Ultragreen Money Carbon Fund has made Celo carbon neutral many times over, and Silvi is proposing using a portion of the excess funds to pave the path to nature-based impact that is not only more vertically integrated into Celo use cases with positive user, smart contract and transaction activity. We really believe this proposal could pave the path to more substantial use cases with the Celo Reserve.","The two closest protocols we can think of in similar spaces are Gain Forest and Open Forest Protocol. We are close with them and value their work. Gain forest appears to be focusing more on protecting existing ecosystems. Open Forest Protocol is more focused on the carbon credit origination. Both of those projects could be collaborators of this effort by either certifying carbon credits from these trees or cross verifying their existence. However, they don't have tree planting methodologies that would engage stewards at the planting stage.","Ultragreen Money is a direct play on Ultrasound money which is original to Ethereum. We wholeheartedly believe in this. Further, we believe Celo is in the strongest position of any other protocol to lead nature-blockchain value creation. We want to make that a reality by helping to back money with nature.","We are betting on Celo continuing to grow and asserting market and mission dominance after the L2 migration. We hope to exhibit a complex, vertically integrated on-chain -> RWA use case of Celo that is paramount to its mission. Further, we're determined to turn Celo's growth into real-world impact in natural capital. We hope this is a signal for the broader nature and climate markets, policy and compliance. We hope this attracts more nature activity on Celo continue to grow ReFi's presence on Celo","We have experienced presenting our work in the Celo ecosystem and have even been invited to present at Celo dev calls. We will be doing all of the above. With the help of Celo, we would like to make a visually appealing, video assisted case study from On-chain transaction through tree planting to show the possibilities of blockchain",[object Object],"Marek Olszewski, cLabs

It is designed to provide consistent support to builders who focus on projects that benefit the common good—whether social, digital, or environmental. The protocol’s Commons Token acts as both a source of sustainable income for builders and a shared exposure for holders in a diverse ecosystem of impactful initiatives.

Through the Commons Protocol, builders access recurring funding and agree to pair their own future potential project tokens with the Commons Token, aligning their success with the broader community. This creates a circular economic model: as projects grow and succeed, so does the value of the Commons Token, benefiting all participants. This structure incentivizes both community collaboration and long-term stewardship, ensuring public goods are maintained and enhanced over time.

Inspired by the Rochdale Principles, the Commons Protocol promotes democratic governance, economic participation, and shared ownership. Token holders have a voice in key decisions, directing resources to promising projects and collectively shaping the future of public goods funding. By aligning incentives with positive social impact, the protocol brings value to both communities and investors, providing diversified exposure to a portfolio of high-impact projects.

Mission: The mission of the Commons Protocol is to build a regenerative economy where public goods are sustainably funded, builders are supported, and communities are empowered to shape a future where shared resources thrive.

Why It Matters: As traditional funding models fail to provide sustainable support for public goods, the Commons Protocol fills a crucial gap by enabling a network of projects that are mutually reinforcing and economically resilient. This decentralized approach ensures that public goods are not only valued but become a focal point of community-driven, regenerative growth.",CommonsOnchain,https://github.com/Commons-Protocol,https://commonsprotocol.xyz,commonsprotocol.eth,"Marco Barbosa,Sharfy Adamantine,Shuhei Tanaka,David Dao,Abhimanyu,Scott Morris,Ken",,"thwayf@gmail.com,sharfy.adamantine@gmail.com,0xstevetanaka@gmail.com,david@gainforest.net,abhimanyushekhawat17.as@gmail.com,Thetokenjedi@gmail.com,code@bitbeckers.com",

By implementing IQF with its impact-weighted formula $$M_{impact} = \left(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (c_i \cdot I(x))}\right)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n c_i$$, Celo community can position itself as the ""Impact L2"" - the go-to chain for verified impact projects that need both scalability and standardized impact evaluation. This creates powerful network effects: as more projects verify impact on Celo, it becomes the de facto standard for impact credentials, enabling new primitives like impact-weighted loans, verified carbon credits, and biodiversity bonds. Just as some L2s specialize in gaming or DeFi, Celo will own the impact verification space - combining Ethereum's security with specialized impact evaluation infrastructure, mobile-first tools, and standardized verification protocols that make it the natural home for the emerging impact economy.","No direct investment has been secured yet, but we have gained significant strategic support. Kevin Owocki, the founder of Gitcoin and pioneer of quadratic funding, has responded positively to our IQF innovation during initial discussions and invited us to submit a formal Gitcoin Community Proposal, which he has committed to support. Additionally, Rene Reinsberg from the Celo Foundation has expressed interest in co-financing a matching round for IQF, demonstrating institutional confidence in our approach to solving the impact evaluation problem. These early endorsements from key figures in both the quadratic funding and ReFi spaces validate our direction while maintaining our independence to develop IQF as a public good.","Following this grant, we anticipate three immediate funding streams in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025:Gitcoin Community Proposal ($30K) - Building on Kevin Owocki's support to implement IQF as a public good on GitcoinCelo Foundation Matching Pool ($25K) - Co-financing the first IQF round based on expressed interest from Rene and the Climate Collective, demonstrating the mechanism at scaleProtocol Sustainability ($15K/month) - Revenue from: Platform fees (2.5% of matched funds) Impact verification services Data marketplace revenue share Celo Ultragreen Money","Without this grant, we would still proceed with IQF development but on a significantly extended timeline and potentially on a different L2.

By introducing impact verification into the core QF matching formula, IQF ensures matching funds are allocated based on actual conservation outcomes rather than marketing spend.

Building on GainForest's successful Conservation Data Income pilots and Metrics Garden's contribution measurement tools, IQF introduces a novel matching formula:

$$
M_{impact} = \left(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (c_i \cdot I(x))}\right)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n c_i
$$

where $I(x)$ represents verified impact scores from our three-layer verification system:
1. Capacity building in transparent data collection (verified through GainForest Data Upload)
2. Proof of legal land stewardship (verified through ZKMail)
3. Forest growth monitoring (verified through satellite imagery and GainForest Trace API)

The system is built natively on Celo, leveraging the network's mobile-first architecture and carbon-negative infrastructure. All impact verification data, funding flows, and matching calculations are recorded on-chain, creating a transparent and auditable funding mechanism for conservation efforts.

Our technical stack includes:
- Impact passport system for standardized project evaluation
- Integration with GainForest's MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) framework
- Real-time satellite monitoring via GainForest Trace API
- Hypercerts integration for impact claims
- Allo integration for automated matching fund distribution

The platform will launch with 10 vetted conservation projects across Asia, Africa, and South America, focusing on indigenous communities and local organizations engaged in biodiversity protection. By solving the incentive misalignment in traditional QF while providing verifiable impact measurements, IQF creates a sustainable funding mechanism that rewards true conservation outcomes rather than marketing efforts.

Our goal is to make IQF the standard for conservation funding on Celo, demonstrating how blockchain technology can transform environmental protection into economically viable activities for local communities while ensuring transparent and verifiable outcomes.",https://x.com/gainforestnow,https://github.com/GainForest,https://gainforest.earth,0x40713Ca5223eFb79E861E282495092D2563c1eCE,"David Dao,Sharfy Adamantine",ninagirl.eth,"david@gainforest.net,sharfy@gainforest.net",https://x.com/dwddao

As we currently are a non-profit open source collective we are not actively looking for investors. You can find an overview of our funding history and treasury here:https://citizenwallet.xyz/funding,"We are working on a token launch in partnership with the q/acc program (https://qacc.giveth.io/) supported by Giveth and Polygon in order to launch a community token called CTZN that can help fund the project in the long run. For the coming year, we are also supported with a grant of 100 000 euros by the region of Brussels/ Belgium in order to launch a regional payment solution called Brussels Pay (https://www.pay.brussels/)By the end of 2025 we aim to generate sufficient revenues to sustain the project. For this we are working on the following revenue streams:Setup fees to deploy community tokenMonthly subscription fees for communities that don’t want to self-hostImplementation fees to use our NFC wallet solution for event transactions.",This would slow down the development of a public library of plugins as we would have to focus on our existing revenue-generating activities and projects.,A community administrator should be able to enable a plugin published through the plugin gallery and interact with it using their community currency on Citizen Wallet.,"While there are a lot of wallets on the markets in the crypto space we strongly believe that there are not yet good solutions to support community currencies and real-world payments.Existing crypto wallets assume that you are either a technical person or a trader. However, most citizens are not interested in active trading.To receive the tokens of your community (aka DAO), citizens need a simple wallet that is already configured for the chain and token address that you use.  A mobile wallet that doesn’t require users to know about gas fees and seed phrases. A wallet that moves the complexity from the end user to the community that they trust. A wallet that also supports the requirements for businesses to accept payments in these community currencies.","With Citizen Wallet, we aim to develop the best platform to deploy and operate local and community currencies.Web3 technologyOpen sourcePlugins for your specific needsDeploy your currency in minutes",We are not aware of other wallets specifically targeting the support of community currencies and offering a library of plugins for the specific needs of a community.,"Our project does align closely with Celo and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This is reflected in our use of Celo's infrastructure to enable community currencies and our dependence on Ethereum's smart contract capabilities for all our core functionalities (like account abstraction). The development of an open-source plugin ecosystem also supports the ethos of collaboration and public goods common in both the Celo and Ethereum communities. Additionally, our plans to further integrate with ecosystem services and modules like Safe, to power our solution further strengthen this cohesion.",We want to give citizens the tools they need to build resilient and regenerative communities. For that we aim to become the Wordpress of community tokens.  We want to become the go to solutions for any community that wants to run its own currency. Currently the main competitor in the space is Cyclos. https://www.cyclos.org/ . Which is an outdated and complex solution for community currencies. Within 3 years we target to onboard 1000 communities  onto Citizen Wallet (cyclos currenty has more than 1800). To support 1000 communities it will be crucial to have a wide range of plugins that can support the different use cases of these communities. This plugin project therefor is a crucial component to reach our targets.,"All our work is open source. As already demonstrated during Celo Gather Berlin, we love to collaborate with the Celo ecosystem to keep testing our solution during events like the Celo Gathering in Berlin.

Inability to understand $EARTH holistically - Our tokenomics and mechanics are fairly ingenious and the lack of an existing mental model to explain $EARTH proves to be a challenging task, we need people to be able to understand the design from a first principles point of view and for that we are working on creating the necessary educational material, conduct more spaces and community calls, incentivize community members to write their own interpretations for people to understand this from different povs, do more podcasts explaining $EARTH as a new unit of value etc 3. Failure to hold attention in the ever changing CT landscape - When the industry is busy chasing the next hot meta buildling something that is addressing real pain points in society often gets overlooked. Its a slow game if you want to be organic and authentic so we will need to come up with innovative solutions to keep the community enagaged and willing to allocate bandwith to $EARTH amongst the many distractions.","A Regenerative Finance Tool: Celo users will have access to $EARTH as a unique currency that directly funds and supports climate positive projects. Every transaction in $EARTH contributes to a treasury backing real-world climate solutions, empowering users to participate in regenerative finance and create tangible environmental benefits through their daily transactions.Expanded NODE Network for Climate Action: Celo’s ecosystem will benefit from the addition of $EARTH Nodes, a community-driven governance structure where users can actively participate in decision-making, project funding, and onboarding. This network fosters a collaborative, impactful community that drives decentralized climate action.New Opportunities for Celo-Aligned Projects: With $EARTH’s treasury dedicated to regenerative projects, projects that are aligned with out thesis of building net zero infrastructure will have access to sustainable funding, fostering a pipeline of climate-focused ventures within the Celo ecosystem.Project that is actively helping Celo achieve its mission of Prosperity for all. Every $ that is purged to mint  $EARTH directly ensures more finance getting allocated to projects that are building the necessary infrastructure for a net zero future which is a deep necessity for creating a world where conditions for prosperity can be created for all beings on this planet.

Our advantage here would be that $EARTH is backed by assets that have real utility for humanity rather than being a shiny metal or scarcity that is artificially induced.  $EARTH would compete with $DAI, $ETH as a potential medium of exchange across blockchains. Our advantage here would be that $EARTH has the potential to appreciate over time while all its assets earn yield in the real world.$EARTH competes with carbon and eco credits to offset negative impact by individuals and organizations ( Toucan, Klima). Advantage here would be that while buying carbon/eco credits it is a charitable transaction, the buyer gets a credit which they retire to claim impact where as in our case it becomes a productive transaction where they get an asset that appreciates while earning them real yield.$EARTH competes with capital looking to invest in RWAs for stable yield. (Helios, Ethic Hub). Our advantage here is that with the kind of tokenomics we have designed we combine real + crypto yields to provide potential investors with returns more than what vanilla RWA investments can provide.","$EARTH is unique in the sense that it is building a digital currency that is purely backed by real world assets that are regenerative in nature, address humanities core needs and earn real yield. It is designed as a new unit of value that embedds the value of ecology/nature in the token and programs solarpunk values into money. With $EARTH we aim to provide Celo Users with a medium of exchange that is perpetually regenerating the real world while earning them real yield. Closest competitor on Celo would be cUSD which is partially backed by eco/carbon credits. $EARTH differs here because we are fully backed only by RWAs that are regeenrating the real world so we optimize for enabling more climate action and regenerations vs ensuring stability if the currency.",None that are an exact replica. Like i mentioned above - cUSD comes across as a protocol that has some potential overlap but we are not a stable coin and are purely backed by Regenerative RWAs. Glo Dollar probably but then again they are backed by real $$ and use the treasury yield to fund public goods where as we are backed by yield bearing regenerative RWAs.,"$EARTH aligns closely with Celo’s mission and Ethereum compatibility by serving as a decentralized, community-driven currency dedicated to funding climate solutions and making regeneration a reality. Built for EVM-compatible infrastructure, $EARTH seamlessly integrates into the broader Ethereum ecosystem, allowing cross-chain accessibility, liquidity, and DeFi functionality. This makes $EARTH readily usable across Celo and Ethereum while remaining accessible to a global, diverse user base.Key Points of Alignment:Inclusivity & Decentralization: $EARTH empowers a community-led network of Nodes to govern and grow a treasury that funds regenerative projects, promoting inclusivity in both financial access and ecological impact​.Regeneration Focus: As a digital currency backed by real-world climate projects, $EARTH directly addresses Celo’s climate action priorities by funneling capital to ecosystem solutions like renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, and ecosystem conservation.Unique Market Positioning: Unlike other blockchain protocols that may focus purely on financial gains, $EARTH is a climate finance token that adds ecological and societal value directly through every transaction. This purpose-driven model fills a gap both within the Celo ecosystem and across the broader blockchain space, as it uses Ethereum-aligned DeFi principles to create real-world ecological benefits.Long-Term Ecosystem Value: By fostering partnerships and deploying capital to regenerative projects, $EARTH can drive future development of eco-focused public goods, infrastructure, and services on both Celo and Ethereum. This cross-chain compatibility amplifies $EARTH’s reach and aligns it with the future direction of both ecosystems, positioning it as a long-term asset with substantial ecosystem impact​​.","In 12 months time these are the nos we are hoping to hit, this is across chains Unique Holders - 10,000Treasury size - $15-20 MillionProjects funded - Above 200 NODES - 400-500Market Cap - $40-50 Million Get $EARTH plugin integrated into over 150 websites/apps","$EARTH is fairly active on X and we post 2-3 tweets daily updating our community on all the on goings. 

Everything that we do will most definetly shared on X, Linkedin and our Telegram community. 

Besides this we also conduct weekly spaces where we will share and update on everything we are building as a consequence of getting this grant. 

Our github repo is open source for anyone to peek and fork.

Will be more than happy to run Demos on $EARTH at Kuneco or at a Celo event in person or virtual. 

Will publish blog posts on each of the Goals we have mentioned and combine that into a one long form blog post to conclude our results at the end of 4 months. ",[object Object],"Monty Merlin - Refi Dao, Celo PG","I think $EARTH is super aligned with Celo and its community. Our mission is to make anthropogenic climate change history and vision to seed the solarpunk paradigm. Celo has been consistently building a value aligned community making it an ideal environment for an idea like ours to blossom. We are already LIVE on Celo, just connecting the contracts to our frontend and if we do get considered for this grant it will ready provide us with the much needed support to GROW $EARTH on CELO. Would recommend having a look at our website once to connect the dots better on what $EARTH is - https://www.solarpunkdao.earth/",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,$EARTH,"$EARTH leverages the power of crypto economics + blockchain to act as a borderless, capital efficient funnel to incentivize, mobilize & allocate capital towards projects directly addressing the climate/environmental crisis and catering to humanities core needs. 

Treasury is dedicated to funding projects in the following sectors - 
 
1. Clean Energy
2. Regenerative Agriculture
3. Clean Transport
4. Ecosystem Conservation
5. Solarpunk Spaces/Eco Villages

As we fund projects in the above mentioned sectors they start serving as assets backing $EARTH. 

$EARTH as a unit of value is designed to create price discovery around the neoliberal value of assets in the treasury + the value of the ecosystem services created by these assets + solarpunk vaues programmed into it. 

 Our goal is to create a monetary system that is powered by real world regenerative assets to seed the solarpunk paradigm.
