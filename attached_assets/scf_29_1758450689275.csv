By integrating Stellar blockchain technology and the Beans Merchant SDK ,which connects to NGNC issued by Link, Cartwey enables customers to pay securely and efficiently using cryptocurrencies like XLM, USDC, and NGNC and other currencies supported on beans, directly from their mobile devices—no checkout queues, no cash handling. Beans handles all swaps and conversions, ensuring seamless settlement for merchants in local currency.","CARTWEY ECOSYSTEM

Customer Mobile App (iOS & Android):  
Enables users to scan product barcodes, view prices, and check out using crypto (via Beans Wallet) or local fiat payment options. Designed for speed and simplicity.  
iOS: Download here  
Android: Download here

Merchant Dashboard:  
Allows store owners to manage products, view real-time transactions, and monitor sales performance. Includes support for dynamic pricing and inventory sync.

Stellar USDC Integration via Beans SDK:  
Supports crypto payments in USDC and other currencies available through Beans. Regardless of the asset used at checkout, Beans handles the on-chain conversion to NGNC and sends the equivalent to Cartwey for merchant settlement. This ensures merchants always receive payouts in NGN while giving customers global currency flexibility.

Multi-Payment Options (via Paystack):  
Accepts bank transfers, card payments, and USSD in addition to crypto — giving customers flexibility while reducing cart abandonment.

Receipt & Notification System:  
Customers get instant e-receipts after checkout. Merchants get notified of sales and inventory changes in real time.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cadQRI-HEu0VMSCS-cQ4qZYpTacSkA8N/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs,"#### Success Criteria

Retail-Specific Usability

-   Cartwey must enable small to large retail merchants (e.g., supermarkets, gadget stores, corner shops) to accept stablecoin payments effortlessly.
    
-   Beans Wallet should support all essential retail transactions, including product scan-to-pay, instant merchant settlements, and cashback/loyalty integration.
    
-   Beans Wallet should also power top-up options for customers preferring to pre-load their wallet for faster checkout.
    

Seamless Transactions & Real-Time Settlement

-   Payments must be processed in real-time, with immediate confirmation shown to both customer and merchant.
    
-   Webhooks must handle event-based updates like transaction success, refund triggers, and balance updates.
    
-   Offline QR fallback (optional) ensures basic checkout even when internet access is poor.
    

Merchant & Shopper Experience

-   The checkout process must be fast, intuitive, and mobile-first, allowing users to scan items and pay within seconds.
    
-   Merchants must receive automated receipts, transaction breakdowns, and daily summaries.
    
-   The dashboard should simplify configuration of tokens, refund preferences, and reporting access.
    

 Scalability & Future Integration

-   Beans Wallet should be deeply integrated into Cartwey's store dashboard and mobile app, ensuring that crypto payments feel native—not an addon.
    
-   The backend infrastructure must support multi-merchant onboarding, allowing hundreds of stores to operate simultaneously.
    
-   Financial reporting must clearly show crypto inflow, token conversions, and stablecoin balances for easier bookkeeping and regulatory clarity.
    

By successfully implementing this roadmap, Cartwey will become one of the first African retail payment platforms to offer smooth, decentralized self-checkout with crypto. This will:

-   Normalize USDC/NGNC as modern retail currencies.
    
-   Attract forward-thinking merchants and crypto-native consumers.
    
-   Position Cartwey as a leading gateway for real-world stablecoin adoption.",https://cartwey.com,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icZ_4FLuh-GqOq6uLzm-FP3VMER7Va4Arz1X-sYuHSM/edit?tab=t.0,https://youtu.be/yJpGKXTYQto,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Cartwey is developing a retail shopping solution that enables customers to scan and pay for products directly through their mobile devices.

Sollpay: Keyless ZK Wallet + Stellar,SCF #38,"Keyless Stellar Wallet-Buy, Send, Invest",,Applications,,Information Collection,,,$118000.00,$0.00,0.00,,Build,"Builds a Stellar-integrated, keyless AA wallet using ZK-based identity to let users send crypto, access DeFi & xStock via phone/email.   Develops a Stellar-integrated keyless wallet system that leverages abstract accounts and zero-knowledge authentication to enable phone/email-based crypto transfers, on-chain stock investments, and cross-chain DeFi access, removing seed phrase risks while expanding the reach of Stellar to mobile-native users.","Sollpay will integrate Stellar into its keyless wallet infrastructure through three major upgrades that enable seamless crypto payments, programmable identity, and cross-chain investing:

1) Stellar Payment Rail Integration

We will implement native Stellar USDC support within Sollpay’s abstract account wallet. Using Stellar’s low-fee, high-speed infrastructure, users will be able to send and receive crypto assets using phone numbers or email addresses, without seed phrases or public keys. This lowers the barrier for onboarding non-crypto-native users, especially in mobile-first regions.

2) Cross-Chain Swap Access Between Stellar And Solana

Sollpay will provide opportunities to Solana’s 32M+ wallet users and 4.8M+ daily actives into the Stellar network by enabling them to seamlessly access Stellar-based assets and payment rails using a single keyless wallet. Through embedded swap bridges, Solana users will convert tokens like SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC directly within the app, enabling real-world spending, remittances, and investment on Stellar. This flow positions Stellar as a destination layer for global users coming from high-velocity DeFi environments, while abstracting away key management and wallet friction through Sollpay’s infrastructure.

3)ZK-Based Identity Abstraction with Stellar Accounts

We will extend our zero-knowledge authentication layer to support Stellar accounts, enabling users to generate secure, non-custodial wallets without manual key management. Stellar accounts will be instantiated and linked through AA+ZK logic, allowing compliant and secure identity abstraction while maintaining user privacy and custody. This bridges the gap between usability and security in the Stellar ecosystem.

By embedding Stellar deeply into Sollpay’s technical stack, we’re not just adding a chain — we’re extending Stellar’s reach into a mobile-first, identity-native, and cross-chain financial layer, unlocking new use cases like contact-based payments, Web3 investing, and frictionless staking for users around the world.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i34nv0N0h7tkohonl7yG33f4tBXi6mvrH60zCzfV_M4/edit?usp=sharing,"Quantitative Success

- User Growth: Onboard 20,000+ new users into the Stellar ecosystem through Sollpay within 12 months of mainnet launch

- Swap Volume: 1,000 users transacting with Stellar assets within six months post-launch.

- xStock Participation: Drive 1,000+ Stellar wallets engaging with synthetic stock assets issued and settled on-chain

- Seedless Onboarding: Ensure 100% of users access their wallets through keyless AA login, without seed phrases or key management

Ecosystem Impact

- User Onboarding into Stellar: Serve as a high-conversion on-ramp, bringing mobile-native and Solana DeFi users into the Stellar network

- Real-World Financial Use: Promote Stellar USDC as a tool for everyday transactions, cross-border transfers, and asset holding

- Developer & Protocol Engagement: Expand usage of Stellar-issued tokens and support anchor liquidity by simplifying access

- Wallet Layer Innovation: Establish a mobile-first, keyless wallet layer that aligns with Stellar’s vision of open, global financial access

- Interchain Positioning: Strengthen Stellar’s role in cross-chain finance by connecting liquidity and user flows from high-activity networks

Vision of Success

Sollpay aims to make Stellar a preferred destination for real-world crypto usage—powered by a frictionless, seedless wallet experience. By enabling easy access to stablecoins, investing, and transfers via phone or email login, we will unlock Stellar for a new generation of Web2 and cross-chain users.",https://www.sollpay.com/,https://github.com/Mercury-Labs-Dev/SollPay-Protocol,https://youtu.be/ve06XUd90_I?si=OSu3ph5ysWJ_nA3P,Yes,"After completing the Stellar integration, Sollpay will launch a targeted, multi-phase go-to-market strategy focused on cross-chain user acquisition, ecosystem collaboration, and mobile-native adoption:

Solana User Migration → Stellar

We will activate our existing Solana user base—spanning over 32 million wallets and 2 million daily active users—by enabling seamless access to Stellar assets such as USDC through contact-based swap flows. With Sollpay’s keyless wallet, users can convert SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC in a single tap, making Stellar a destination layer for real-world spending, stablecoin usage, and digital payments.

Cross-Chain Ecosystem Partnerships

Through integrations with leading Solana protocols (e.g. Jito for staking, Jupiter for swaps), Sollpay will offer high-value Stellar onramps to a DeFi-native audience. These features will be delivered within our user-centric wallet interface, abstracting away seed phrases and complex bridging, and accelerating Stellar exposure across cross-chain communities.

Community Activation & Brand Visibility

As a member of Solana Superteam and a portfolio company of both the Binance France Web3 Accelerator and the HEC Incubator at Station F, Sollpay will leverage its strong presence in the European Web3 ecosystem to run demo campaigns, education workshops, and user onboarding events focused on GenZ and mobile-first users entering the Stellar ecosystem.

Product-Led Growth Strategy

By combining contact-based transfers, seedless account creation, and xStock investing into a single mobile-native interface, Sollpay lowers the entry barrier to on-chain finance. This positions Stellar as a gateway to real-world payments and investing, while enabling a Web2-friendly, secure, and scalable experience from day one.","Ecosystem Partnerships & Recognition

-   Regulators access real-time dashboards that flag anomalies, ensuring higher food safety standards at lower oversight cost.
    
-   Importers gain verifiable transparency on 200+ shipments, strengthening trust in Nigerian produce.
    

4. Financial Inclusion & Ecosystem Impact

-   First-time access to digital wallets for thousands of rural farmers, with Beans-App providing seamless NGNC↔Naira conversion for non-crypto users.
    
-   Micro-loans and trade finance unlocked via Stellar smart contracts, enabling farmers and processors to fund larger shipments.
    
-   A trusted infrastructure for cross-border trade will be created, positioning Stellar as the backbone of Africa’s agri-fintech ecosystem.",https://agtrail.agrolinking.com,https://github.com/JosephFashola/agtrail-eco-trace,https://youtu.be/3XlmUlGRc_Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Our go-to-market strategy is designed to ensure both grassroots adoption by farmers and market trust from exporters and buyers, using a decentralized but coordinated rollout model.

1. Cooperative & Local Agent Onboarding  
We will deploy a network of trained local agents, modeled after our Tadamon mobilizer approach, embedded within 100+ existing farmer cooperatives and NGO programs. These agents will act as first-line support helping farmers set up Stellar wallets, capture IoT/QR-based production and harvest data, and understand NGNC payments. Local agents reduce barriers to adoption by offering hands-on technical assistance in rural areas where digital literacy and connectivity remain low.

2. Pilot-to-Scale Pipeline  
The first cohort of 50+ farmers and 5 processors will transition from pilot use into production use on mainnet. Local agents will replicate this process across Kaduna, Kano, and Oyo, expanding to 500+ farmers within 6 months post-launch. Each cooperative cluster will become a mini-hub of traceable exports, ensuring scale while keeping onboarding costs low.

3. Exporter Compliance Integration  
Exporters and processors will be integrated directly into AgTrail’s Stellar-powered traceability and certification modules. This ensures that every shipment automatically produces regulator-verified QR codes, compliant with NAFDAC, EU, and FDA FSMA standards. Exporters will also be early users of pay-per-trace flows and verification fee modules, anchoring them as paying customers from day one.

4. Regulator & Buyer Trust Building  
We will partner with NAFDAC’s digital sandbox and European agrifood consultants to validate certification token logic and cross-border workflows. Verified pilot shipments (e.g., sesame and ginger) will serve as case studies, providing confidence to buyers and regulators. These documented proofs-of-compliance will be used to secure Letters of Intent (LOIs) from importers, unlocking premium pricing opportunities for farmers.

5. Financial Access & Liquidity  
Through the Beans-App fiat bridge and partner banks, farmers will be able to instantly cash out NGNC payments to Naira, removing dependency on crypto literacy. Exporters and processors will gain access to invoice factoring and trade finance modules, ensuring liquidity for larger shipments. This financial backbone makes AgTrail not just a traceability tool, but a market-enabling infrastructure.

6. Expansion Strategy  
Once export compliance and payments are proven in Nigeria, the model will replicate regionally across West Africa through cross-border cooperatives. Local agents will remain central to scaling, ensuring adoption is community-driven, regulator-approved, and buyer-verified.","AgTrail is currently in the early growth stage, with a functional MVP deployed and active pilot programs running with mid-level farmers and processors in Nigeria.

Post-launch, a marketing initiative will be activated.",Ilia,8aba2843 (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1758463200000/qrSHfRdfk7CTZjK0N-Yxdg/HaMnxwf84hPUuO4N2MkpZsNO2X4n03d2V1n14UhO2Lyu-6KFXPOnKEUHB1ioYfAa4If5xPeISxQGkSa0VtSn_269dkyd535TtThkefPbW9do6bAtZhLsoT0wDKLBiAkZdfs8JMnecnbPq3lHRRHHvg/nTQcNEbHgKsep2zFdxVORkTe3dmojspTZYrJoCdWO_M),,https://x.com/CryptoRubic,,

Remittances & Payments (Already built & testnet-integrated — not part of SCF 38 funding)

Problem: Traditional remittance services in Africa cost 7–12% and take hours or days to settle, leaving refugees and unbanked without timely access to funds.  
Solution: Instant USDC transfers to Lul wallets, with options to keep funds in USDC or withdraw via cash-out agents, couriers, or mobile money. Wallet-free payouts deliver cash directly to recipients without smartphones.  
How Stellar Helps: Near-instant, low-fee settlement and transparent proof of delivery on an open ledger.  
Impact: Affordable, inclusive remittance access even for the most digitally excluded.

Note: Included for completeness — not part of SCF 38 funding request.

2. Crowdfunding

Problem: Global platforms like GoFundMe exclude many Africans, especially refugees, due to banking and policy barriers.  
Solution: Built-in Stellar-powered platform where users can launch campaigns, receive USDC globally, and withdraw in local currency. Soroban smart contracts hold funds in escrow until goals/timelines are met.  
How Stellar Helps: Enables low-cost cross-border contributions and escrow logic for secure disbursements.  
Impact: Unlocks global fundraising for excluded communities with transparency and trust.

3. Agent & Courier App

Problem: Digital wallets are less useful if users can’t easily top up or withdraw nearby without high fees.  
Solution: Lightweight app for agents/couriers to provide local cash-in/cash-out, including wallet-free deliveries, avoiding bank and mobile money margins.  
How Stellar Helps: Instant settlement between agent and user wallets with verifiable transaction records.  
Impact: Increases access and convenience, especially in refugee camps and underserved areas.

4. Virtual Cards (Planned – Integration with Rain.xyz)

Problem: Many unbanked and refugee users can’t make online purchases or pay for digital services.  
Solution: USD-denominated virtual cards linked to Lul wallets for online payments directly from USDC balances. API access to Rain is already secured.  
How Stellar Helps: Instant, low-cost top-ups from Stellar-based USDC.  
Impact: Expands digital commerce access without requiring bank accounts.

5. Multilingual Support

Problem: Large portions of our user base do not speak English, creating adoption barriers.  
Solution: Add Swahili, Luganda, Amharic, Arabic, Somali, and French to the app with a language switcher.  
How Stellar Helps: Makes the Stellar-powered platform usable across diverse remittance/refugee corridors.  
Impact: Broadens reach and trust by making the platform accessible to non-English speakers.

6. External Service Integrations

Problem: Users need familiar, local cash-in/cash-out and cross-border transfer options.  
Solution: Integrate mobile money APIs (MTN, Airtel) for local transactions and Yellow Card for USDC–fiat transfers to 20 African countries.  
How Stellar Helps: All transactions settle on Stellar for speed, low cost, and transparent tracking.  
Impact: Expands reach and adoption by connecting to trusted payment rails across Africa.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v5zhRfs_7ob1DwYOcCYRsY4OHGM1jpKi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117888080581823504664&rtpof=true&sd=true,"For our team, success will be defined by our ability to deliver high-quality, accessible financial services to people who are currently excluded from the global financial system—particularly refugees and unbanked individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa.

These communities are often unable to save, send, or receive money in secure way, let alone participate in e-commerce or access basic digital tools for economic empowerment. For us, success means removing those barriers—empowering people who have been overlooked to securely transact, save, and grow financially.

This is not just a technical mission—it’s deeply personal. All of us on the team have experienced this exclusion firsthand, and one of us still lives as a refugee. We know what it means to be locked out of financial opportunity, and our ultimate measure of success is to ensure that as many people as possible never have to face those same limitations again.",https://www.lulpay.com/,https://github.com/Zerie5,https://vimeo.com/1108903029,Yes,"Go-To-Market Plan

IRL.energy is building a global cultural rewards ecosystem where users earn points by attending events, engaging with venues, participating in games, and completing challenges. These points unlock rewards, event experiences, and digital assets. IRL bridges digital and physical worlds, making blockchain engagement seamless for non-crypto natives while offering advanced tokenized features for Web3 participants.

**Stellar Events Smart Wallet & Rewards Platform  
**To extend this system and accelerate adoption, we will integrate a Stellar-powered event-focused smart wallet and rewards platform. This platform transforms Stellar’s IRL and virtual event presence into sustained onchain engagement — driving community retention, monthly active addresses, and TVL growth, while showcasing Stellar’s smart contract capabilities.

Core Capabilities

-   Event Discovery & Access: Real-time feed of Stellar and partner events, exclusive NFT/merch drops, and participation-based rewards.
    
-   Engagement Mechanics: Onchain games, scavenger hunts, achievement badges, leaderboards, and raffles/lotteries.
    
-   Integrated Rewards: Event-specific perks, NFT/merch issuance, and USDC/$IRL redemption via Stellar rails.
    
-   Future Payments Integration: Tap-to-pay NFC merchandise and in-event USDC/$IRL transactions.
    

Front-End & Feature Development (MVP & Global Map)

-   User Dashboard & Profile with Stellar wallet integration (passkey-based onboarding).
    
-   Global Venue Map with in-person check-ins and point issuance.
    
-   Reward Center for perk redemptions and future $IRL/USDC spend mechanics.
    
-   IRL Four Square Game (online & in-person check-in challenges).
    
-   Leaderboard and achievement tracking.
    
-   Partner Dashboard for venue/creator reward issuance and payout tracking.
    
-   NFT Cultural Identity Module (opt-in) for unique event-based collectibles.
    
-   Basic Analytics Layer to track engagement, retention, and transaction flow.
    

#### Products & Services

IRL will integrate Stellar in three major product layers:

-   Points-to-Token Rewards: Users earn IRL Points via event check-ins and quests. These are redeemable for USDC or $IRL tokens issued on Stellar, enabling fast, low-cost incentives across borders.
    
-   Partner Dashboard & Wallet Tools: Venues and cultural institutions access a dashboard to distribute, track, and fund perks and rewards in Stellar-based assets.
    
-   Global Payment Rails: IRL enables ticket payments, creator payouts, and sponsor funding in Stellar-native assets, enhancing global financial access.
    

Impact: These integrations lower the cost of loyalty rewards, remove geographic limitations, and prove out a real-world consumer use case for onchain value exchange — onboarding thousands of users into the Stellar ecosystem.

Technical Infrastructure

-   Wallet: Stellar-based smart wallet architecture using MeridianPay Base Wallet and passkey authentication.
    
-   Soroban Smart Contracts: Reward logic, onchain games, raffles, and point conversions.
    
-   Low-Cost Transactions: Using Stellar’s fast settlement and built-in DEX for liquidity and swaps.

-   Sustainable Token Economy: By creating a closed-loop system of IRL Points and Stellar assets, we build a viable circular economy around cultural participation",https://www.irl.energy,https://github.com/hurley87/refraction,https://youtu.be/idQWBBxYXkk,Yes,"Go-To-Market Plan
---------------------

IRL’s go-to-market strategy leverages a proven cultural network and an expanding global footprint of events and venues. Our approach is built around real-world adoption and user testing, with Stellar-powered rewards embedded directly into cultural experiences.

-   Beta Launch in Key Cities: We will activate campaigns in New York, Toronto, Amsterdam, Berlin, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Mexico City and beyond through events, venue partners, and local creators. Attendees earn IRL Points and redeem Stellar-based rewards on-site.
    
-   Partner Onboarding: Cultural institutions, clubs, and festivals will be onboarded via direct relationships built by the Refraction network. Each partner gains access to the IRL dashboard to issue perks and manage campaigns.
    
-   Creator and Artist Incentives: Artists and performers earn token-based perks for participation and promotion, creating incentive loops for adoption. Early collaborators receive exclusive perks and NFT drops tied to IRL experiences.
    
-   Event Activations + Stellar Payments: Payment rails for artist payouts and venue redemptions will be introduced via Stellar USDC in live settings. IRL will document and promote case studies on how culture and crypto interact in practice.
    
-   IRL.energy Growth Engine: Our website and dApp (irl.energy) will promote quests, track check-ins, and highlight partners using Stellar. We will build integrations with wallets and ecosystem partners to surface IRL across cultural media.
    

All IRL activations during the build period in development are funded through our ongoing Refraction and IRL activation partnerships - no funding from the grant will be used for these purposes. 

Please note that all Footage and documentation in video are from Refraction and IRL events globally, and will continue with testing and ongoing GTM activations as per the above within the Refraction and IRL partner ecosystem, including events with the Stellar team.

After the successful build program we will then apply for the Growth program, which we are confident can scale IRL into the millions with regard to users and wallets. 

Please see activations and work to date:

https://www.refractionfestival.com/","IRL / Refraction has one of the highest traction ratings of any web3 / web2 org and upon completion have already been asked to start providing rails toward Stellar activations globally.  IRL will have potential to be the onchain culture product of the entire stellar ecosystem, both in Web3 and more importantly web2 growth, vis a vis Stellar’s aims.

Kasi Money,SCF #38,Fiat→USDC→MoneyGram cash-out in Africa,Kasi Money,Applications,,Information Collection,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$150000.00,$50000.00,129645.25,9/17/2025,Build,Migrant workers send fiat from bank account and family gets cash cheaper + faster via USDC on Stellar.No crypto complexity,"Kasi Money is a digital banking platform built for gig workers, freelancers, and the two out of three South African workers who earn irregular income. We are the official banking partner for Bolt, South Africa’s largest ride-hailing platform, and already serve over 50 000 customers. Our users receive a fully featured bank account and debit card to receive income, spend, and save. We also offer short term lending and automatic investing into a money market fund, giving customers both liquidity and yield.

  
Over 40% of our customer base are migrant workers from other African countries. For this group, the most requested feature is an affordable, fast way to send money home. Currently, they must withdraw funds from their Kasi Money account, visit a separate remittance provider, and pay 5 to 10 percent in fees, with some providers taking up to two days for settlement.

This project will add instant, low-cost remittances directly from the bank account they already receive their income in.  
  
Customers will send fiat (ZAR) from their account, which is converted to USDC using a licensed South African crypto exchange. The USDC is then sent over Stellar and delivered via MoneyGram’s payout network for instant cash out in the recipient’s local currency. By integrating on-ramp, blockchain settlement, and off-ramp in one seamless flow, we eliminate multiple intermediaries, reduce costs to a fraction of current rates, and settle in minutes without exposing users to crypto complexity.  

How the new service will work:

1.  Customer selects “Global Pay” from their Kasi Money account.
    
1.  Enters recipient details and payout country.
    
1.  ZAR is converted to USDC via a licensed South African exchange.
    
1.  USDC is transferred over Stellar to a Crossmint wallet linked to the sender.
    
1.  Recipient details together with USDC are transferred to MoneyGram dedicated wallet
    
1.  MoneyGram’s Stellar-based payout network instantly makes cash available in the recipient’s local currency.
    
1.  Recipient receives an SMS with pickup instructions for their nearest MoneyGram location.  
    

In the initial phase, our Stellar integration will leverage native protocol features including:

-   Payments for fast and low-cost USDC transfers
    
-   Trustlines to manage asset custody within Crossmint wallets
    
-   Multisig and pre-authorized transactions to maintain compliance and control over wallet movements
    
-   Memo fields to embed KYC-linked transaction references  
    

These capabilities allow us to execute the full flow from ZAR → USDC → local-currency cash-out instantly, while meeting compliance requirements.  

Looking ahead (not in this project scope), we will integrate Soroban smart contracts to:

-   Implement programmable escrow logic for staged payouts or regulatory holds
    
-   Enable dynamic liquidity routing to optimize FX rates and provider selection by corridor
    

This phased approach delivers immediate value to our customers and partners using Stellar’s proven core protocol, while building toward a programmable, scalable remittance infrastructure that can expand across Africa.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQDMIRbyA0B7hf1_MGZvQ-iZ9Mi7Hqz26vI2O58kb10/edit?usp=sharing,"Success Metrics

1.  Official Stellar Partnership: as the exclusive provider of official Stellar merchandise, our platform will immediately benefit from Stellar’s global visibility, credibility, and established audience. At in-person events, we will fully integrate into Stellar’s existing merch operations, replacing the current fragmented process with a unified, blockchain-enabled system.
    
1.  Online Store Launch: the Shopify-based global store will serve as the official online destination for Stellar-branded products. The platform’s “Official Merch Provider” positioning ensures instant trust and adoption.
    
1.  Exclusive Collaborations & Limited Drops: we will work with renowned artists and designers to create unique, collectible pieces. These will generate hype, attract new audiences beyond the core Stellar community, and drive recurring engagement.
    
1.  Ecosystem Integration: we will partner with Stellar-funded projects to design, produce, and distribute their own merch lines. This creates a powerful B2B growth loop, as each project brings its own audience to the platform while benefiting from our infrastructure.
    
1.  Community Engagement: through the DAO layer, social media activations, and co-creation contests, the community will actively participate in shaping future drops and collaborations, fostering loyalty and repeat interactions.
    

In terms of monetisation, we will discuss with SDF and the community. We could take a commission on (re)sales and for specific actions being performed on the platform. Another option would be to enlist this project as a Public Good project.","While the platform is in its pre-launch phase, there is significant validation from within the Stellar ecosystem:  

-   We have been in discussion with SDF and they would support our initiative. SDF already has a supply chain setup and we would build a platform on top of it. In the end, SDF will be one project on the platform (keeping a central position of course.)
    
-   Event Demand: hundreds of merch items are distributed at every Stellar-hosted event, with attendees consistently expressing strong interest in accessing products outside of these occasions.
    
-   Ecosystem Demand: each SCF round funds a dozen of projects, many of which seek to launch branded merch but lack the resources or expertise. Our platform directly addresses this gap.
    
-   Community Feedback: informal discussions with Stellar community members and project founders reveal strong enthusiasm for a unified, NFT-enabled merch platform.
    
-   Market Gap: there is currently no centralized, scalable, or blockchain-integrated merch solution within the Stellar ecosystem, making the transition to our platform a natural next step for the community and the SDF.","1.  Shopify based store;

Create Stellar Wallets with KMS: Businesses can CREATE Stellar wallets directly in Arrel. Private keys are secured via our internal KMS, ensuring full control stays with the client. [Already deployed on mainnet after SCF#37 (Check Notion workspace - link )].
    
1.  Unified Asset & Updated Wallet Aggregation Dashboard: Businesses can connect both newly created and existing Stellar wallets, and track balances, tokenized assets, and transactions from a unified dashboard. Fully coded → To be deployed under SCF38.
    
1.  Payment Links: Merchants, PSPs, NGOs, or fintechs can create one-time or recurring payment links to receive Stellar assets like USDC or XLM. Links can be embedded in websites or apps, or shared as standalone URLs
    
1.  Compliance Monitoring (KYT)= Each transaction is KYT-eligible. Through our Chainalysis integration, users can automatically generate compliance reports. Examples available in our shared Notion workspace ( link )
    
1.  Custody Options and User Controls: Businesses can choose between using self-managed wallets or integrating a custodian via API with our partner Fireblocks. In both cases, they can enforce rules such as transaction approval workflows, limits, and time-based controls.
    

What this unlocks for our clients:

→ Create a Stellar treasury wallet instantly

→ Accept stablecoin payments or donations in USDC, EURC, while staying compliant.

→ Enforce compliance (KYT) at transaction level

→ Rebalance funds automatically in Arrel, or auto-transfer funds to 15+ CEXs

→ Slash off-ramping costs from 1–5% to a flat amount in local currency (e.g. 1 EUR per SEPA withdrawal for any amount, no extra integrations or KYC from service providers)

→ Keep treasury in stablecoins, BENJI, or FX-hedged assets

→ Automate asset swaps, rebalancing, or tactical trading — no devs required

Ecosystem Impact:

→ Brings real-world businesses, payment providers, NGOs, and fintechs into Stellar

→ Increases on-chain stablecoin flows and anchored fiat volume",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nso4pxYsiwoJdukUkukfqClqEdIXQaGjwxpgb1yQZ8/,"→ All core features implemented as described in the Products & Services section

→ Successful tests on mainnet, KYT reports, off-ramp and integrations.

→ ≥50 active businesses wallets (self-custody or Fireblocks-linked) by mid 2026

→ ≥ $20m of payments processed by mid 2026",https://www.arreltech.com/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SIM4684uAjwq2zBfqegS8XFQlxR9L92i_zlXu16ffKQ/edit?usp=sharing,https://youtu.be/q-IRxBjHn5Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Arrel operates out of Mauritius and South Africa, our home base and core market, with hundreds of billions of dollars in annual payment and remittance flows across neighboring countries.

This region anchors our outbound sales and business development efforts, targeting four key segments: merchants, NGOs, payment providers, and fintech platforms.

To capture this market and expand beyond it, we have defined three additional focused go-to-market streams.

Stellar Ecosystem

-   Our first users for the payment flow will naturally come from within the Stellar community →
    
-   Maintain a strong presence in Discord, SCF calls, and ecosystem events
    
-   Run live product demos during major moments like Meridian to showcase real-time payment-to-fiat flows
    
-   Approach ecosystem players with revenue-share offers → they integrate Arrel, we split fees on processed volume
    
-   Position Arrel as the go-to payment and compliance layer for any Stellar-native wallet, NGO, or fintech looking to go live instantly
    

Events & Side-Events (Web2 + Web3) for PSPs, Remittance Providers & financial institutions.

-   Actively participate in top fintech events across EMEA → sponsor, exhibit, or send BD reps to engage directly with decision-makers
    
-   Focus on high-impact events like Money20/20 (EU + US), Seamless Middle East, Africa Fintech Summit, and Abu Dhabi Finance Week
    
-   In parallel, maintain strong presence across Web3 circuits → sponsor side-events and deploy BD teams to build channel partnerships
    
-   Prioritize community-driven conferences we already attend annually: Paris Blockchain Week, EthCC, Token2049 (Dubai/Singapore) → leverage these to expand reach and drive qualified leads from crypto-native networks
    

Digital Marketing Channel

-   With product-ready onboarding and a frictionless flow, digital becomes core to our GTM → we shift toward an inbound strategy
    
-   Target online/offline merchants and e-commerce sellers directly where they already live and promote their brands and products
    

By mid 2026, our target is:

-   Land 50 additional web2/web3 businesses via current GTM
    
-   Cumulative $20M monthly processed","Arrel currently operates a B2B2B/2C model, currently serving:

– FIVE (5) hedge funds with asset managers supporting institutional flows and HNWIs

– FIVE (5) payment providers offering compliant crypto payment rails to businesses and individual clients

→ We have TEN paying clients located in South Africa, Mauritius, Hong Kong and Canada

→ We are growing our revenue 10% MoM

→ We process, on average, USD 15 MILLION in monthly volume

All flows are already fully processed in production on other blockchains, not just monitored as in the current Stellar integration. A portion of these can migrate to Stellar once the required features are delivered.

-   While SCF#26 gave our clients the ability to ADD and MONITOR Stellar wallets, it did not yet enable the critical transaction features (wallet creation, KYT integration, payment links, off-ramp execution) required for live flows.
    
-   Based on client demands, we designed SCF#38 submission to remove that bottleneck: once these features are live, a portion of our existing $15M monthly volume can migrate to Stellar immediately (especially USDT to USDC).
    

Pilot Projects

-   Payment provider preparing to migrate USDT on TRON flows to USDC on Stellar; past single transactions reached 2.4M USDT through our infra & KYT engine, representing multi-million monthly volume potential. (check KYT reports here: link ).
    
-   In partnership with VAULT FX and HumanInsights AFRICA, we launched Phase 1 of a BRICS-aligned cross-border crypto settlement system focused on agricultural and healthcare trade across key African corridors. Stellar is the proposed primary chain for treasury and settlement once the necessary infrastructure is in place ( check MOU here: link ).
    

By mid-2026, we commit to achieving:

-   Onboard 50 additional web2/web3 businesses
    
-   Process $20M monthly, including 15-20% running on Stellar as initial phase target.","Estimated Completion: October 15, 2025

By integrating with Stellar, DD will power a trust layer across the ecosystem, allowing developers to query wallet and token safety scores and display warnings or take action before transactions are executed. This infrastructure will make Stellar network safer and more resilient for new users, institutions, and for on-chain finance.

We have a number of services, but here are some of the highlights:

-   Fund Flow analysis: screen wallets, transactions, and protocols for malicious or risky fund flows, helping platforms stay compliant, fight malicious behavior, and keep users safe
    
-   Wallet and Token scoring: DD any address on chain, giving users and builders insights into financial, behavioral, and code-based risks to make better decisions
    
-   Transaction Simulation: industry-best tx simulation to catch issues before they're executed on-chain

Agnostic,SCF #38,Bringing Real-Time Analytics to Stellar,Agnostic,Infrastructure & Services,,Test Transaction,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$121000.00,$40333.33,104580.49,9/17/2025,Build,Offers a real-time analytics platform to help Stellar developers access and explore on-chain data easily with SQL-powered tools,"What Agnostic Is

Agnostic is a real-time analytics platform purpose-built for blockchain data. It allows developers, analysts, and enterprises to query, visualize, and share insights on-chain—without building custom data pipelines or managing low-level infrastructure.

Agnostic is now going all-in on Stellar. We are building a dedicated indexing and analytics stack for the Stellar blockchain, providing a unified interface for accessing both core ledger data and emerging smart contract activity via Soroban.

Our mission is to make Stellar data programmable, observable, and shareable, using the full power of ClickHouse, SQL, and AI-assisted interfaces. Agnostic abstracts the raw complexity of blockchain data into intuitive analytics layers—enabling everything from simple balance lookups to cross-asset liquidity analytics or compliance dashboards

The Problem

Stellar is one of the most efficient and mature blockchain infrastructures, particularly suited for payments and stablecoins. However, visibility into Stellar’s on-chain activity remains fragmented and underutilized: - No common query language (Horizon is REST only) - No native SQL or BI integrations - Difficult to track smart contracts (Soroban) - Limited support for reproducible research

For developers and analysts accustomed to tools like Dune or Flipside on EVM, Stellar’s data tooling remains underdeveloped.

The Solution

Agnostic builds a complete data analytics stack for Stellar:

-   ch-stellar: A set of high-performance user-defined functions that enrich ClickHouse with Stellar-specific capabilities.
    
-   Open analytics tables: A set of analytics table in Apache Iceberg format produced by our ClickHouse-based ETL engine (AGT)
    
-   AGX: A data exploration UI leveraging ClickHouse that allows users to explore and query Stellar tables with SQL. AGX also empower users with an AI-powered query generation companion.
    
-   DGN: A collaborative platform for users to share and collaborate on Stellar data
    

Agnostic reduces development time and unlocks visibility for developers, liquidity providers, researchers, and institutions building on Stellar.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJcAY5WPEWMSjeq1jm9rfTRfVzvAZCTY_ogpHhZbaM/edit?tab=t.0,"Metric: Target (6 months)

My approach is to put WebSoroban directly in the hands of developers at the exact moment they feel friction with existing tools.

1. Address the Pain Point Directly

We’re targeting ex-Okashi dev users and active Soroban developers who are stuck dealing with complex CLI/SDK setups. We’ll position WebSoroban as the “open your browser and start building” alternative - removing setup entirely.

2. Meet Developers Where They Build

We plan to launch at Stellar hackathons, DevRel events and within open-source communities. We’ll work with Stellar global ambassador network to host “Code in the Browser” workshops that get developers building in under 15 minutes.

3. Build in Public

We’ll share progress updates, demos and new AI features on X, Discord and GitHub. By letting developers test features early, We’ll create feedback loops that turn early adopters into vocal advocates.

4. Showcase Success Stories

Every project built with WebSoroban will become a proof point. We’ll spotlight developers who go from idea to mainnet deployment in a single weekend, showing exactly how fast and effective the tool is.

5. Drive Network Effects

We’ll grow a library of community-built, Stellar-compliant contract templates, making it easier for the next wave of builders to get started. Every new deployed contract boosts Stellar’s network activity, transaction volume and overall mindshare.

Core Principle: We’re not chasing hype - We’re removing friction. If WebSoroban saves hours for developers, they’ll tell others. As the word spreads, both adoption and the Stellar ecosystem will grow.","-   Early Market Interest: WebSoroban has generated substantial demand ahead of launch, securing a waitlist of 450+ developers. This audience includes both established Stellar builders and cross-chain developers exploring Soroban for the first time.

Minah.io is an investment platform transforming the investment landscape for Real World Assets (RWA) in West Africa, solving the pain point of funding capital in the region thanks to blockchain efficiency.   With this submission, we want to seamleassly integrate DeFi opportunities for the general public (staking, bond's interest reinvestment, etc).","Minah.io – On-Chain Investment Platform for Africa
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Minah.io is launching a fully on-chain investment platform enabling global investors – particularly Afro optimist investors – to support Real-World Asset (RWA) projects in West Africa through secure, transparent, and tokenized investment flows.  
A first investment strategy has already been deployed and is available as a working demo.

The platform leverages the fast, low-cost, and compliance-friendly Stellar blockchain, along with its extensive coverage across Africa, to deliver an end-to-end investment experience.

Key Features to Be Developed or Enhanced
--------------------------------------------

1. Regulated Tokenized Investment Vehicles

We will issue a fully compliant security token representing a €500,000 loan pool, incorporating built-in logic to manage subscriptions, redemptions, and coupon payments.  
This token will be registered and distributed in accordance with applicable French and OHADA financial regulations.

2. Investor Access & Onboarding

Using Stellar-compatible wallets (e.g., Freighter), investors in Europe and North America will be able to connect, complete KYC via Sumsub, and invest directly in vetted projects in Togo and Ghana.

For individuals indirectly impacted by our funding—such as tenants in financed buildings or suppliers in supported agribusinesses—we will onboard them to manage their cash flow on-chain.

This will involve integrating user-friendly wallets like Vibrant or Lobstr, enabling seamless conversion between local fiat currencies and on-chain assets.

For each loan pool, we anticipate a transaction volume approximately three times the invested capital; for example, a €500,000 pool is expected to generate around €1.5M in on-chain transactions.

3. DeFi Integration for Yield Optimization

We plan to integrate staking, automated reinvestment of bond interest, and potential liquidity solutions—allowing users to maximize returns through DeFi-native strategies.

4. On-Chain Monitoring & Transparency

All key events—including loan repayments, collateral updates, and social impact indicators—will be recorded immutably on-chain.  
Investors will have access to a transparent dashboard displaying real-time KPIs and financial flows.

4 bis. On-Chain Local Integration with the Real Economy

For investments tied to OHADA economic participants, key financial transactions will also be executed on-chain.

For example, rent from the primary tenant in the first financed building will be paid directly on-chain, ensuring complete transparency from mobile money to wallet.

This model will onboard new Web3 users and generate recurring transaction volumes, as the entire payment infrastructure (e.g., rent collection systems) will be blockchain-based.

  
5. High-Impact Use of Funds

Funds will be allocated to carefully selected infrastructure, renewable energy, and agricultural value chain projects.

These sectors were chosen for their strong multiplier effect on employment, supply chain resilience, and sustainable development.

We have also identified sustainability KPIs to monitor and ensure long-term impact.",https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fuwfrzuupf16obqiwksbq/Minah-Technical-Architecture.docx?rlkey=ogkzibewxp6vtge6opk6i34xx&st=df9814io&dl=0,"By the End of Q4 2025

The system serves two primary stakeholder classes — Liquidity Providers (LPs) on the supply side and Traders/Borrowers on the demand side via an account-abstraction driven margin infrastructure directly connected to multiple derivatives and lending protocols.

A) Liquidity Providers (Supply Side)

-   Isolated Lending Pools: LPs supply assets (XLM, USDC, EURC) into protocol-isolated pools, eliminating cross-asset contagion and impermanent loss risks typical of AMM LPing.
    
-   Superior Yield Mechanics:
    
    a.  High Utilization Rates from leveraged borrowing demand (up to 10x capital amplification per trader), driving sustained borrow APRs above baseline market rates.
        
    a.  Liquidation Penalty Distribution, where penalties from leveraged position liquidations are shared directly with LPs in addition to interest income.
        
-   Capital Protection: Borrower funds remain in Vanna’s smart accounts, which operate under predefined protocol rules that control every action. All borrower interactions are processed through the risk engine, ensuring lenders’ capital is protected and lending risk remains fully contained within each isolated pool.
    

B) Traders / Borrowers (Demand Side)

-   Account Abstraction Margin Accounts: Traders open Soroban-native smart accounts capable of managing multi-venue leveraged positions.
    
-   Undercollateralized Borrowing: Deposit initial margin and borrow up to 10x additional capital. Combined margin and debt can be programmatically allocated across supported markets:
    
    -   Leveraged LP Yields: Soroswap & Aquarius AMM LP positions with borrowed capital.
        
    -   Leveraged Spot Trading: Direct execution on Soroswap and Aquarius spot markets.
        
    -   Leveraged Lending Strategies: Yield generation via Blend lending pools.
        
-   Risk Optimization Layer: Professional-grade monitoring and hedging through an integrated dashboard, allowing you to track all active positions with payoff graphs and risk parameters, while enabling delta-neutral, leverage farming, looping leverage, and custom hedging strategies.
    
-   CEX-Grade UX On-Chain: Mimics traditional proprietary trading desks’ leverage workflows, fully ported on-chain through Soroban smart accounts.
    

Protocol Architecture (Soroban)
-----------------------------------

The protocol architecture is built as a multi-layered execution and risk infrastructure with strict modular separation to optimize for security, composability, and protocol-integrated strategy automation.

1. Core Infrastructure Layer

-   Lending Pools Module: Supports XLM, USDC, EURC with isolated reserve logic and utilization-based dynamic interest rate curves.
    
-   Account Manager Module: Central transaction arbiter validating every margin operation, ensuring pre-execution health factor compliance.
    
-   Margin Account Module: Permission-gated, per-user contract instances supporting only protocol-approved leverage functions; enforces margin integrity.
    
-   Risk Engine Module: Real-time solvency computation for both overcollateralized and undercollateralized positions, integrated with liquidation automation triggers.
    
-   Interest Rate Model Module: Dynamic non-linear borrow/lend rate calculations (inspired by Sentiment Protocol), adapting to utilization changes.
    
-   Protocol Registry Module: On-chain mapping of all live controllers, adaptors, and integrated markets for deterministic protocol-level calls.
    

2. Leverage Execution Layer

-   Controllers & Adaptors: Dedicated per-protocol controllers for Soroswap, Blend, Aquarius; abstract venue-specific logic while enforcing risk & leverage constraints.
    
-   Oracle Integration: Primary integration with Stellar Oracle SEP to source standardized, time-weighted price data for supported assets. Includes contingency for custom or third-party oracle providers if SEP coverage, latency, or reliability thresholds are not met, ensuring accurate pricing and robust failover in volatile markets.
    
-   Cross-Protocol Position Management: Enables simultaneous leverage allocation across LP, spot, and lending venues within a single health factor envelope.
    

3. User Interaction & Risk Visualization Layer

-   Lending-Side Interface: Deposit, withdraw, and real-time pool utilization monitoring.
    
-   Margin-Side Interface: Create margin account, deposit collateral, borrow, repay, withdraw and dynamically reallocate leverage.
    
-   Trading-Side Interface: Customised, one-click execution for leveraged LP, leveraged spot, and leveraged lending positions.
    
-   Risk Management Dashboard: Continuous monitoring of live leveraged positions with health factor metrics, payoff curves and strategy simulation tools, all directly integrated with smart account operations
    

Engineering Scope & Execution Requirements

The Soroban deployment of Vanna demands a ground-up engineering approach due to the absence of pre-built EVM-equivalent standards and tooling. The build requires:

-   Custom Lending Pools: Isolated accounting logic with utilization-based dynamic rates for XLM, USDC, EURC.
    
-   Account Abstraction Layer: Soroban-native margin accounts with protocol-enforced leverage permissions.
    
-   Cross-Venue Leverage Modules: Controller and adaptor contracts for Soroswap, Blend, and Aquarius with integrated risk constraints.
    
-   Multi-Source Oracles: Aggregated price feeds with failover handling for on-chain solvency checks.
    
-   GraphQL-Powered Indexing: Off-chain infrastructure to feed real-time position, health factor, and Greeks analytics to the risk dashboard.
    

The execution plan includes full-cycle development — contract authoring, venue integrations, indexer and frontend implementation, stress testing under high-LTV scenarios, and multi-layer economic risk modelling — ensuring that the protocol meets the operational and economic security standards required for production deployment on Stellar.",https://best-glue-0c8.notion.site/Technical-Architecture-249846d6f559806292b8e57691c00920?source=copy_link,"The success of Vanna’s Soroban deployment will be measured through on-chain verifiable metrics directly correlated with protocol functionality, liquidity depth, and trader adoption. Each metric is tied to specific smart contract modules and will be tracked via internal analytics, public Stellar blockchain data, and real-time Dune dashboards.

Smilepay Global,SCF #37,"Send stablecoins like a text, globally!",Smilepay Global,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$50000.00,$16666.67,42405.48,8/20/2025,Build,"Smilepay is an app and API that enables users to send (off-ramp) stablecoins (USDC, EURC, PYUSD) from the U.S. and Europe directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa.","Problem  
Sending money across borders in Sub-Saharan Africa costs an average of 7.9%, compared to the global average of 6.4%, making it the most expensive remittance corridor in the world. To avoid high fees, millions are turning to stablecoins like USDC. However, converting these digital assets into local currencies remains costly, opaque, and largely informal, creating risks and inefficiencies. In many African countries, including Ethiopia, there is no formal way to off-ramp stablecoins into bank accounts and mobile money networks. Users must rely on black-market channels that are expensive, slow, and prone to fraud - further discouraging adoption and trust.  

Solution  
Smilepay is an app and API that enables users to send (off-ramp) stablecoins (USDC, EURC, PYUSD) from the U.S. and Europe directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa. We integrate with regulated local banks and mobile money networks in Africa - and soon in Latin America and Asia, to provide seamless, low-cost, and fully compliant stablecoin off-ramps, making cross-border payments as easy and affordable as sending a WhatsApp message.  

Product 1 (App):  
Example, a user can send $100 worth of PYUSD (PayPal’s stablecoin) from Venmo to the Smilepay app. From there, the user has two options: they can either instantly transfer that PYUSD peer-to-peer to another Smilepay user in Ethiopia who will receive the stablecoin directly in their wallet or they can send it to any of the 29 banks we’ve integrated in Ethiopia. In the latter case, the recipient will receive the equivalent amount in Ethiopian birr (ETB), directly deposited into their bank account.  

Our partner bank receives the PYUSD and can convert it into fiat currency at their discretion. This flow is straightforward to implement, as our partner banks are motivated to earn foreign exchange. Integrating PYUSD is seamless due to its upcoming support on the Stellar network (check link below 👇🏻), which Smilepay is also built on. This model is simple and straightforward to expand and will soon be extended to other African and Asian countries.  

https://stellar.org/press/paypal-pyusd  

Product 2 (API):  
Our API allows any regulated financial app, whether fintech, mobile banking, or crypto wallet - to offer cross border payments to Africa, Asia, and Latin America using stablecoins.  

Our API customers fall into two categories:

a. Web3 native platforms (e.g., Venmo, Cash App, crypto wallets): If a Web3-native platform like Venmo integrates our API, users won’t need to download the Smilepay app. They can directly send PYUSD to any of the 29 integrated banks in Ethiopia and eventually to banks across all supported countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. And with just one integration with Venmo, we can serve more than +90 million people.  

b. Web2 fiat based platforms (e.g., Bank of America, Zelle, ING): Our API isn’t limited to crypto-native apps. Traditional fiat-based banking apps can also integrate Smilepay API to offer international transfers through stablecoins without needing to become Web3-native themselves or disrupting the user experience. There are two key flows:  

• Fiat-to-fiat: A user sends local fiat (e.g., USD or EUR) from their bank app to a recipient in Africa or Asia. Behind the scenes, Smilepay API converts it into stablecoins (e.g., USDC or PYUSD), routes it efficiently through blockchain rails, and then off-ramps it into fiat in the recipient’s country, dramatically lowering costs and settlement times.  

• Fiat-to-stablecoin: Alternatively, the sender can choose to have the recipient receive the funds directly in stablecoins like USDC, EURC, or PYUSD, giving them access to dollarized savings and on-chain financial tools.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBk2POsUOW3zqBzoKWYg-9Fe7QGffxCe5lYcX6cKrOA/edit?usp=sharing,"##### 1.

We plan to collaborate closely with Stellar’s existing ambassador network in Ethiopia. These ambassadors are already engaged in blockchain education and advocacy, and can play a key role in driving adoption of our stablecoin off-ramp solution. By onboarding them as local champions of Smilepay, we’ll tap into their trust networks to accelerate user sign-ups and provide direct product onboarding support, especially for freelancers, crypto users, and tech-savvy youth in Addis Ababa and other major cities.  

2. Community Engagement Through Local Blockchain Events  
We’ll organize and co-sponsor meetups, workshops, and panel discussions with Ethiopia’s growing blockchain community. These events will demonstrate how Smilepay bridges global stablecoins and local fiat, giving attendees hands-on experience with the app. We’ll also host hackathons to invite developers to build with Smilepay and Stellar, deepening local ecosystem engagement and attracting integration partners.  

3. Strategic Social Media Marketing & Influencer Outreach  
Our campaign will focus on visibility through respected tech personalities in Ethiopia and the diaspora. We’ll engage Ethiopian tech influencers, fintech founders, and African crypto thought leaders to post about Smilepay—highlighting our real-time bank transfers and stablecoin use cases. This will give Smilepay credibility and boost user interest organically.  

4. Cross-Marketing With Partner Bank  
We’ll run joint campaigns with our partner bank, including shared social media announcements, radio ads, and educational posts about how Smilepay helps attract forex through stablecoins. Since the bank benefits directly from these flows, they are incentivized to promote us across their channels, branches, and user base. This partnership gives Smilepay immediate institutional legitimacy and reach within Ethiopia’s regulated financial system.","1.  We have integrated with 29 Ethiopian Banks
    
1.  We launched five weeks ago and are currently live on both Android and iOS in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, UAE, and Ethiopia. Users in these countries with a USD debit or credit card can send money directly to any of the 29 Ethiopian banks we’ve integrated. So far, we’ve processed over $9,600 in transaction volume while focusing on fixing bugs, improving the user experience, and optimizing onboarding. This initial traction has been achieved with zero paid marketing—driven purely by word of mouth and a few organic social media posts.
    
1.  Every new user is automatically issued a Stellar blockchain wallet on the backend—laying the foundation for our upcoming stablecoin off-ramping feature. Soon, users in the U.S. and Ethiopia will be able to off-ramp stablecoins like USDC and PYUSD directly into local bank accounts. Currently, as you can see on the explorer link below, the accounts created on-chain are issued our own branded stablecoin, but we are transitioning to USDC to ensure broader compatibility, trust, and liquidity.  
    https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/STUSD-GBGOD4GCZ4DZY5UQD26LU2OGANHPTYTVO4XSEAP5ITNI6FUMSAG3QTB7-2
    
1.  We’ve already completed a successful 2-month stablecoin off-ramp pilot with one of our Ethiopian partner banks, which demonstrated strong institutional demand. Banks are excited to participate because stablecoin and remittance flows often bypass their systems. Smilepay gives them a direct channel to capture these foreign exchange inflows—critical in high-forex-demand markets.
    
1.  Our main goal for SCF 37 is to expand this stablecoin off-ramping capability beyond the pilot to all 29 banks we’ve integrated with in Ethiopia.

Tipper,SCF #37,Tipper mainnet (Post kickstarter),Tipper,Applications,,Awarded,33,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$70875.00,$47250.00,120737.77,9/10/2025,Build,Tipper is the platform for LaAm content creators who want to monetize their audience & receive USDC on Stellar,"Tipper is the best platform for Latin American influencers, artists, and communities who want to monetize their audience, receive support from fans around the world, and automatically convert tips and earnings into Digital Dollars by receiving USDC on Stellar. Creators love to finally be able to receive and withdraw their funds in Dollars anytime, from anywhere—especially those who do not have a U.S. dollar bank account, and even those who do not even have a bank account.

Tipper enables content creators to receive small payments from their fans around the world and converts those payments into Digital Dollars (USDC on Stellar); this feature enables content creators to unleash revenue streams, creates new product opportunities, and allows them to be more independent and free.

**After completing and being awarded a validation prize during the kickstarter program, we're have been adding those insights and suggestions into our roadmap: we are ready to hit mainnet fast, and focus on growth and scale.

Tipper is composed of three different modules; we'll build the first two for our initial launch

-   Content creator’s hub: This is where creators can share their personal story, their passion and links to their social media and best work. This hub will allow creators to channel their following to read and learn from them,  and share love from their fans, as well as it being the epicenter for them to sell their artwork or subscriptions.
    
-   Monetizing network: Once the fan agrees to support their favorite creator’s , they are then moved to the monetizing hub, where fans select in which way they want to pay for the support they are giving. Initially card payments , as well as USDC on Stellar are enabled. In the future this will also have other less common payment methods, as well as other crypto.
    
-   Tipper APP: IN A FUTURE SUBMISSION we will build a non-custodial app that receives funds and withdraws to one whitelisted address to begin with, and will improve the app for our future versions, in order to improve the tipper experience. WE’ll do this as a result of our interviews and first interactions with content creators, after delivering our proof-of-concept MVP in order to validate our initial kickstart findings.
    

Through seamless integration of all its components, Tipper offers a platform that empowers content creators to monetize their passion and audience in an easy and affordable way, while automatically receiving payments via the Stellar network—helping to drive greater adoption of Stellar, increasing demand and awareness for Stellar as the driving force on the space and a real-world tool of crypto adoption.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB06IfbNqtfYWXmpnDVdZ_uEqgX0_OKv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110653500898179745003&rtpof=true&sd=true,"We will focus our user acquisition for our early adopters on those jurisdictions, as we focus on solving one main problem: Social media content creators in these regions cannot monetize their content in an automatic way.

-   Run our MVP with around 50 test users by launch; grow to 100 testers in first months; surpass 500 registrations before end of 2025, and achieve at least 5000 registered users in H1 2026.
    
-   Transact the first 1,000 USDC on Stellar in the first month, then get to 5,000 ARR in Q1 2026
    
-   Get to high 3 figures of TX count in 2025, then surpass mid 4 figs in 2026
    
-   Grow our social media presence to a community of over 5,000 in H1-2026",https://tipper.lat/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB06IfbNqtfYWXmpnDVdZ_uEqgX0_OKv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110653500898179745003&rtpof=true&sd=true,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F67H3Y3avss&feature=youtu.be,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","#### Our growth strategy for the MVP phase focuses on three key actions:

-   Drive usage among beta testers and design partners.  
    We aim to generate at least $1000/month in transactions from our initial dozen beta testers and design partners. We’ll refine and improve the product based on their feedback and encourage them to recommend Tipper to their network. Our goal is to grow this a closed group of 50 early adopters in a private community.
    
-   Kickstart adoption in three underserved niches.  
    We’ll target cosplayers, musicians, and donation-driven animal shelters — groups that are now overlooked but rely heavily on small, loyal networks. Growth in these niches will be driven by word of mouth and an invitation-only sign-up process, helping us reach our first 500 users by the end of Q4.
    
-   Focus on three underserved regions.  
    We’ll concentrate on Bolivia, Paraguay, and Venezuela — markets not served today by incumbent companies. Initially, access will remain invitation-only, then expand via access codes. This approach will allow us to build a strong foundation, enabling our goal of reaching at least 5,000 subscriptions by 2026.
    

To execute this, we’ll partner with mid-sized social media creators who already have engaged audiences in regions with complex financial systems — starting with Venezuela and Paraguay, and exploring Bolivia, Caribbean islands, and similar markets.

We are working with the following users as initial design partners:

-   Fax1703 (IG 2540 Follows) 
    
-   albanycoiman (IG 6042 Follows)
    
-   carlospenalozao (IG 42.6k Follows)
    
-   CheoChop_Oficial (IG 92k Follows) 
    
-   ReveronRichie (IG 102k Follows)
    
-   @cxrrly (Twitter/X 173.2k Follows)
    
-   6 others (Combined following of around 100k, including Ezio Rojas, and more)
    

We will focus user acquisition for our early adopters on those jurisdictions, as can solve a big issue they have: Content creators in these regions cannot monetize their content.

#### Offer/Message:

-   For Creators: ""Now you can finally get direct support from your fans. With Tipper you can earn more, and build stronger relationships with your fanbase.""
    
-   For Fans: ""Support your favorite local creators instantly. Small tips, big impact.""
    

#### Distribution and specific plan:

﻿Work and fine-tune our product by working closely with our first 50 content creators:

-   Closed invitation only beta product for the first 50 creators leveraging our personal networks (Personal, plus X and Linkedin invitations from founding team); heavy social media marketing actions.
    
-   Establish direct relationship with influencers (partner with relevant creators to promote Tipper; offering zero fee for a year, which has no cost to us)
    
-   For sign ups after the 50 first creators, we will create FOMO with a waitlist
    
-   Organize influencer marketing meetup or/and webinar
    

The other component of our launch plan includes working on Fan Acquisition:

-   Social media marketing (target fans of specific creators)
    
-   Social media promotions: Meet & greet days
    
-   Creator promotion (creators encourage their fans to use Tipper)
    

#### With this plan we will grow, by organically onboarding our first 50 users, then growing to 100, then 1000, and then 5000 in the first 3 Qs.","In a nutshell, we have:

-   Grown 451% followers on main social media (Instagram) by sharing we will soon be available. IG grew from 100 followers to almost 600 in just one month. [[Visit Tipper's IG]](https://www.instagram.com/tippercreator/?hl=en)
    
-   We grew 5,320% visits to our website, after sharing we'll soon be available. Today, our only traffic source is IG. We'll triple once we add more channels.
    
-   Through website visits we have a whitelist of +200 possible beta testers, who organically registered to our website.
    
-   Group of 20 design partners who use social media for income, and want to increase their performance.
    
-   Combined reach of 550,000 followers from our first dozen beta testers/design partners.
    

Since we began validating the idea and interviewed content creators as design partners, we secured a loyal group of two dozen launch partners who have more than 500,000 followers in aggregate.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fCGUg0Vq4ROs2KciVq0L4Ev_Nrh3XPZlwtMtN00epro/edit?usp=sharing

A key insight we want to share is that every one of the initial group of influencers has invited someone else on their network as a Tipper user for our closed beta; this happens because Tipper solves a real pain point they are frustrated with: LatAm influencers are currently limited on how to monetize their audience.

We initially set to speak to only ten influencers and through their own interest, we crossed over 24 interviews.

In our closed-door demo, during bitcoin pizza day in Venezuela, 100% of surveyed attendees liked the concept, 93% of them signed up to join  the waitlist, and almost ½ of them requested more features, such as shared revenue from promoted sales, and adding specific tipping amounts for crowdfunding, which are As a result of this, we conclude our product concept has strong market demand.

Even though we have not gone live with our platform, the demand we are seeing on social media, leads us to expect hundreds of new accounts signups per month during all of launch in Q4 2025, as our posts get dozens of comments of people wanting to try it out.","Brief description: Build the base and working functionalities for the Content creator’s hub.

DomiPago,SCF #37,DomiPago: Chat-Based Stellar Remittances,DomiPago,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$110000.00,$36666.67,91988.28,8/5/2025,Build,"Send money to the Dominican Republic through a simple WhatsApp chat—powered by Stellar USDC, with zero crypto experience needed.","DomiPago turns a simple WhatsApp chat or web session into a full‑featured remittance hub.

#### What senders can do

-   Quote & lock FX instantly – type “Rate” in WhatsApp or click “Check rate” on the web/app to see a live Stellar‑USDC quote in <1 s.
    
-   Fund in one tap – approve a bank, card, or SEPA/Interac pull; we mint USDC on Stellar and move it across‑border in seconds.
    
-   Smart address book – save beneficiaries and pre‑set amounts (“Send 100 USD to mamá” auto‑fills the flow).
    
-   Real‑time receipts & history – every on‑chain transaction ID and status update appears in chat and in the app’s timeline.
    
-   Conversational support – the same chat thread handles FAQs, rate alerts, and payment confirmations—no new app to learn.
    

#### What receivers can do

-   Request funds with context – choose “Groceries”, “School fees”, etc.; a payment link is pushed to the sender’s chat in seconds.
    
-   Choose how to get paid – bank deposit, wallet top‑up, or soon QR cash‑out—all selected inside WhatsApp or the web portal.
    
-   Instant in‑chat notifications – “Funds delivered” messages arrive the moment Stellar USDC is off‑ramped.
    
-   Personal ledger – view incoming amounts, purposes, and senders in a clean, mobile‑first history.
    

#### What makes DomiPago different

1.  Chat‑first UX – no separate app download is required; the entire flow lives in a WhatsApp conversation most users already trust and use daily.
    
1.  Stellar‑native settlement – every transfer rides USDC on Stellar, delivering sub‑second speeds and near‑zero fees that traditional rails can’t match.
    
1.  Two‑way dynamic – receivers aren’t passive; they trigger requests, set purposes, and steer payout preferences, turning remittances into a dialogue.
    
1.  Multi‑surface access – identical functionality is mirrored in a responsive web/app for users who prefer a traditional interface.
    
1.  Consumer‑grade simplicity, crypto‑grade transparency – senders and receivers experience a 60‑second flow, while every hop is verifiable on‑chain.
    

DomiPago hides the complexity behind crypto, wraps it in everyday chat, and delivers value where it’s felt immediately: family support that arrives faster, cheaper, and with zero guesswork.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nNtzQGWsxsQoD7sEkv_ftOBXfF1uD8X_/edit,"Success for DomiPago is measurable in three data‑driven dimensions—adoption, usage, and ecosystem impact—within 12 months of mainnet launch:

1.  Adoption   
    • ≥ 15 000 total users onboarded, of which 40 % are monthly actives (≥ 6 000 MAU).  
    • At least 5 banking partners in the DR embed the “Request via DomiPago” flow, giving us sustained receiver acquisition at <$5 paid CAC.
    
1.  Usage   
    • Cumulative remittance volume ≥ USD 1.5 million, processed across ≥ 6 000 transfers.  
    • Average active user sends ≥ 3 transfers per month; month‑over‑month retention ≥ 50 %.  
    • Average door‑to‑door settlement time ≤ 40 seconds; average fee savings vs. legacy rails ≥ 50 %.
    
1.  Ecosystem impact on Stellar   
    • ≥ 75 % of total volume settles as USDC on Stellar rails, evidenced by on‑chain transaction hashes.  
    • 1 000+ Soroban escrow contracts executed in production, securing ≥ USD 250 K.  
    • Publish open‑source docs and SDK snippets; target ≥ 3 external developers or wallets integrating our escrow status endpoint.
    

Hitting these metrics means tens of thousands of dollars saved in fees for Dominican families, thousands of new users interacting with Stellar for the first time, and a live Soroban use case that demonstrates real‑world programmable money at scale.",https://domipago.com/,https://github.com/melomar10/stellar_integration,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cge3vBITA6M,Yes,"1. Anchor the receiver side through Dominican banks (Month 0).  
We are finalizing integrations with two Tier‑1 banks that collectively hold >60 % of retail deposit accounts. Each bank will add a “Solicitar dinero con DomiPago” button inside its mobile app and WhatsApp broadcast lists. When a customer taps it, our bot pre‑fills a payment request linked to the user’s IBAN—no app download, no new KYC. The bank wins higher deposit inflow and an innovation headline; we instantly gain thousands of verified receivers with near‑zero CAC.

2. Pull in senders with co‑branded corridors (Months 0-3).  
Once requests are flowing, we flip on diaspora‑side acquisition through:

-   Visa “Back‑to‑School” and “Navidad” co‑promos (landing pages + interchange rebates) targeting U.S./CA cardholders who already send money home.
    
-   Diaspora NGOs & hometown associations that can share referral codes in group chats; each first remittance earns the receiver a fee waiver and the NGO a small donation paid out of spread.
    
-   Influencer live demos on TikTok/Instagram showing “Watch me send $50 in 40 seconds.”
    

3. Reinforce virality with product‑led loops (Months 3‑6).  
Every successful payout pushes a “Share your link” nudge to both sides. Because the entire flow lives in WhatsApp, a single tap forwards that request into family group chats, multiplying exposure at marginal cost ≈ $0.

4. Expand corridors once liquidity flywheel spins (Months 3‑12).  
With DR receivers activated and U.S. volume ramping, we replicate the same playbook for EU SEPA and Canada Interac senders, using local bank newsletters and ethnic‑media radio to seed the first wave.","Since launch, DomiPago has proven that WhatsApp-based remittances are not just possible—they’re preferred. By removing the need for apps or crypto knowledge, we’ve built a product that fits seamlessly into users’ daily lives while delivering real-time financial value. Our traction reflects not just early adoption, but strong signals of product-market fit, retention, and readiness to scale with Stellar rails.

-   $676 K in remittance volume moved to date—all generated organically, with zero paid advertising.
    
-   +3 000 users onboarded, with  25 % monthly actives—driven primarily by WhatsApp referrals and diaspora community word‑of‑mouth.
    
-   High engagement: each active sender completes 3.7 transfers on average, at an $233 average ticket, covering both micro‑ and mid‑sized remittances.
    
-   Retention that signals stickiness: 50 % month‑over‑month retention—half of first‑time senders return the very next month, outperforming most retail‑remittance benchmarks.
    
-   Operational proof‑points: end‑to‑end settlement ≤ 40 s; customer‑support median response < 5 min through the same chat thread.
    
-   Market validation: recently launched joint campaigns with Visa and multiple Dominican banks, promoting DomiPago inside their user bases to request funds via our WhatsApp flow—setting the stage for a substantial growth surge over the coming quarters.","Deliverable 1 – EU SEPA on‑ramp via Bridge

LumenShade: privacy pools,SCF #37,LumenShade: Privacy for Stellar,LumenShade: privacy pools,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$135000.00,$45000.00,112894.70,8/5/2025,Build,"LumenShade gives Stellar users a powerful new option for financial privacy, paving the way for fully compliant private DeFi on Stellar.","At LumenShade, we're bringing financial discretion to Stellar.

We were inspired by projects like Tornado Cash, 0xbow’s Privacy Pools and Railgun.

Our mission is simple: empower users with financial privacy, while building the foundation for fully compliant, private DeFi on Stellar.

Motivation

Stellar is an incredible platform for fast, low-cost global payments, especially across emerging markets.

But today’s users don’t have strong privacy options.

We believe that privacy is a necessity, not a luxury, and it’s time for Stellar to start offering real options.

Right now, payments on Stellar are fully public.

We strongly believe that mainstream blockchain adoption will come when privacy is integrated by default.

Think about NGOs working in sensitive regions, businesses wanting to protect their payment flows, or just regular individuals who simply don’t want their entire transaction history displayed to the world…

LumenShade can help make this possible.

Our modular components will be reusable for other projects in the ecosystem, fueling further innovation in privacy across the Stellar developer community.

Description

In simple terms, LumenShade lets users deposit Stellar assets (like XLM and USDC) into a shared pool, and withdraw them later without anyone being able to trace the link between the deposit and the withdrawal.

Here's how it works:

-   When a user deposits funds into the pool, he receives a unique note (a secret) that proves ownership of that deposit
    
-   Later, when the user wants to withdraw, he generates a zero-knowledge proof showing they own one of the previous deposits, by proving knowledge of the previous “note”
    
-   The smart contract verifies the proof and, if correct, releases the funds to a specified address. There’s now no way to link that withdrawal with any deposit
    
-   The more deposits, the bigger the anonymity set, the more private each user is
    

Here are some of the key features we're excited to deliver:

-   Privacy-preserving deposits and withdrawals, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs
    
-   Intuitive frontend and CLI tools, for a seamless user experience
    
-   An innovative compliance layer featuring:
    
    -   selective disclosure: users can prove the origin of funds when needed
        
    -   admin control on deposits: blacklisting if required
        
-   Modular, reusable smart contracts and circuits, enabling future ZK projects on Stellar
    

We also take inspiration from Railgun, which has set a high bar for compliant privacy pools with features like “private proof of innocence”. LumenShade is built to move Stellar in that same direction.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVhnmMx6q_nvB-kN6veLVP9DS-sDI19ehNMtaTL7aVw,"-   Technical Success:

1.  An Android mobile app, named Ben Wallet.
    
1.  A WebApp, to provide account information and details view on account transactions and account stats, named MyBen hosted on https://myben.xyz.
    
1.  An RPC server that handles blockchain interaction as well as Launchtube interactions, named BEN RPC.
    
1.  A monitoring and reporting server to provide timeseries information on the platform's status, as well as consolidated stats, named Ben OpenStats.
    
1.  An offload-compute server, for part of the farming cycle, so devices can offload compute-intensive tasks, named Remote Grow.
    
1.  A Kotlin SDK for Android mobile apps, to support building Stellar-based apps on mobile devices.
    

It is important to highlight that once Protocol 23 is deployed, higher limits will require higher network usage to re-test; the mobile app has the potential to bring additional “test” users (where load comes from real-life interactions).

Complete information on the platform can be found on our live docs: https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/ben-wallet",https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/ben-wallet/sdlc/development/architecture/context,"'-   At least 15% conversion rate from Web-based farmer to Ben Wallet, after mainnet launch
    
-   3% MAU increase after mainnet launch
    
-   Branding-wise: Ben wallet becomes a well known player in the ecosystem.
    
-   Kotlin SDK adoption and other mobile apps are made by third parties (or by us) with our SDK.
    
-   Our Gitbook serves as a guide for other SCF candidates; meaning, they use our docs structure as a template for their submissions (we think we are on the right track structure and information wise). Standardization would go a long way to help reduce burden of SCF reviewers while conducting reviews.",https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/,https://github.com/Ben-Platform,https://youtube.com/na,Yes,"We don't intend to wait until mainnet to start promoting Ben Wallet, as the advantage of sideloading means early users can try out the app (and platform) even while we are on alpha and beta releases.

Our releases will be published on our github as .apk, and an Installation guide will be provided not only on Github but also on our live docs at: https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/ben-wallet/help/user-guide

Once we have stabilized at least our mobile application, we would like to promote via socials (mentions on @buildonstellar would be appreciated!) as well as with the team at LumenLoop. We will also reach out to Ambassador groups for amplification, as well as the Stellar Global Discord.","We're basing our initial traction on the one brought so far by KALE, and high-usage of the network by its operations.","Our MVP will focus on the Tractor (harvest) function since it requires the most basic setup for transactions to be made.

Our core innovation lies in integrating Stellar-native compliant stablecoins (USDC and eventually PYUSD) to revolutionize how users earn, transfer, and interact globally.

Here's a breakdown of how Stellar fits into our key features:

1. 1-Click Stablecoin Onboarding (USDC & PYUSD)

-   What’s being added? Streamlined Stellar Account Creation via Circle Programmable Wallets and social logins (Google, email) for instant access to Stellar-native stablecoins like USDC (and later PYUSD).
    
-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's account model and Circle integration abstract away crypto complexities (keys, wallet setups), lowering the barrier for non-crypto users.
    
-   What’s the impact? Directly solves ""Onboarding Complexity."" Ensures our 30,000+ users and thousands of new monthly users can effortlessly use Stellar payments, driving mass adoption for global digital economy participation.
    

2. Gasless Microtransactions

-   What’s being added? Enabling Stellar-native USDC (and soon PYUSD) deposits/withdrawals with ROSEN covering all network fees (XLM) via Fee Abstraction.
    
-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's near-zero fees ($0.00001 XLM) and native fee-sponsoring make absorbing costs viable, ensuring micro-transactions are economically sound and user-friendly.
    
-   What’s the impact? Directly addresses ""Global Payment Friction"" for ""Digital natives in emerging markets."" Users transact cents without gas worries, fostering a highly active and liquid digital labor market.
    

3. Cross-Border Social Economy (In-Chat Stablecoin Payments)

-   What’s being added? Integration of in-chat stablecoin payments (USDC/PYUSD on Stellar) with AI translation for features like Instant Tipping and Micro-Task Rewards.
    
-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's sub-5-second settlements and design for high-frequency, low-value payments enable truly instant, affordable, borderless value transfer within social interactions. Compliant stablecoins ensure trust.
    
-   What’s the impact? Directly tackles ""Limited Economic Opportunities"" and ""Global Payment Friction."" Creates a liquid digital labor market, strengthens communities, and provides instant, global monetization for skills.
    

4. Global Decentralized Recruitment (Talent Matching & Community Incentives)

-   What’s being added? Businesses can post jobs and pay incentives/salaries in USDC (and later PYUSD) on Stellar. We also use Stellar-native stablecoins for in-community voting and contribution rewards.
    
-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's speed, low cost, and transparency are ideal for P2P and community payments. Compliant stablecoins provide a reliable medium of exchange, aligning with our decentralized vision.

A logistics pilot with a Houston-based medical-supply NGO is tracking roughly $1.2 million of equipment bound for Ukraine and Kenya. Every pallet scan fires a smartphone-triggered smart contract that stamps GPS and device metadata onto Stellar, giving the shipper an immutable chain-of-custody without any new hardware or connectivity burdens. This corridor is our first real-world stress-test of the logistics module and sets the groundwork for an Afghan lane now being scoped.

Using the exact same code-base, we spun up a remote-vetting application for at-risk Afghans pursuing Special Immigrant Visas. Participants submit time-stamped, geotagged “pattern-of-life” check-ins through the mobile interface, creating an auditable proof-of-presence ledger that immigration advocates can reference during the application process. The pivot demonstrates how the platform shifts effortlessly from freight assurance to human-movement verification without touching the underlying architecture.

Next in the queue is a Humanitarian Mine Action module being in partnership with Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. The project will apply reBlue’s verification stack across all five HMA pillars (clearance, risk education, victim assistance, advocacy and stockpile destruction) through a mixed-methods research program scheduled to launch in 2025. While pre-deployment, the partnership signals a clear path into a third vertical and shows how the same trust layer can be ported into any high-friction domain where provenance decides impact.  

Our most notable source of recent traction might need to be approached in a separate SCF Submission, as it deviates from what we pitched in June. However, it is extremely noteworthy, as we believe it to have the highest overall upside, not to mention that engaging with informal value transfer systems was our original focus prior to the collapse of USAID.

 H.R.260, or the ""No Taxpayer's Dollars for Terrorists Act"" is a bill which passed the US House of Representatives and June 24, 2025, and seeks to explore the movement of US funds to Afghanistan. Notably, the bill explicitly calls for an examination of cash assistance programs, and transactions made using Hawala – an informal value transfer system that is ubiquitous across the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa.

The objective of this pilot is to show that despite its checkered history, Hawala is a critical lifeline to Afghan Allies, and can be modified to be transparent and auditable while also bypassing Taliban control measures. Veteran-led NGOs – (of whom reBlue’s CEO is a founder) have long used Hawala or other informal systems to deliver aid—will serve as the backbone and coordinating body for a live demo of a U.S.-based, blockchain-enabled Hawala tracking system.  
  
This pilot will be paired with an Oxford-backed research project (our founders are MSc and PhD students respectively) and the findings of both will be presented directly to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with whom we have an existing relationship.","'-   Open-source scan-to-ledger pipeline that anchors delivery event metadata (GPS, timestamp, IMEI) to the Stellar testnet using Soroban

NOTE: The introduction of H.R.260 --which is mentioned frequently through this application-- is arguably the single greatest opportunity that reBlue has encountered. In no small part, this is because engaging with informal value transfer systems is both reBlue's original purpose prior to USAID's collapse, and is CEO Thomas Kasza's area of research at Oxford. However, given that the bill was introduced on June 24th, our budget request is still aligned with the scope of our original application.","'-   OCR module replacing QR-based system to support scanning of printed text, manifests/invoices and serial numbers.

We enable structured DeFi investment into real-world assets such as EV chargers, solar panels, and data centers by validating their future cash flows before any token is issued.

Our system addresses two major bottlenecks in real-world asset (RWA) finance:

First, on the investor side, there is a lack of verifiable data. Infrastructure investments often rely on subjective claims, limiting trust and adoption. Dobvalidator solves this by bringing auditable, revenue-based data onchain. This transparent scoring system replaces subjective trust with objective, data-driven assessments.

Second, on the operator side, infrastructure teams face limited access to decentralized funding. Even strong projects struggle with the complexity of tokenization and the absence of a reliable process. Dob Token Studio addresses this by transforming validated future cash flows into programmable tokens with automated onchain payouts. This makes infrastructure assets ready for integration into DeFi from the beginning.

Dobprotocol is building foundational financial infrastructure for real-world yield: secure, composable, and integration ready.

  

Our system consists of two core components:

Dobvalidator

Dobvalidator brings real world infrastructure data onchain through a transparent and accountable scoring process. Assessments are based on verifiable criteria, such as revenue, uptime, location, and technical specs, and are recorded onchain for public inspection. Projects are evaluated against a consistent set of risk and revenue factors. Our aim is to make this process fully transparent and auditable onchain. This approach replaces blind trust with transparent, methodical validation, ensuring only infrastructure with verifiable cash flows and operational quality can issue tokens and enter DeFi.

Dob Token Studio

Dob Token Studio is a token creation suite that issues programmable tokens backed by validated infrastructure revenue. These tokens represent future revenue streams and include built-in logic for automated, decentralized revenue sharing. Investors receive payouts directly, with no intermediaries. Tokens are composable and ready to plug into lending markets, AMMs, and dApps.

By combining Dobvalidator and Dob Token Studio, Dobprotocol transforms real-world infrastructure into yield-bearing digital assets that can be integrated across the decentralized economy.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kn3WPiuZDqN91N1lDFSCZPm3dyTMWY5I6YrS4eCG0xo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.byaoi144ub2a,"Short term (by January 2026):

-   Validate and score a minimum of 5 infrastructure operators through Dobvalidator, covering assets such as EV chargers, solar panels and data centers.
    
-   Launch two revenue-backed token issuances via Dob Token Studio, representing over $150,000 in projected cash flows over a 12–18 month period.”
    
-   Deploy the full protocol stack on Stellar Mainnet, including validation scoring, token issuance, and automated payout logic, meeting SCF Build’s third tranche requirements.  
      
    

Medium term (by June 2026):

-   Expand to 10 active, revenue-generating infrastructure assets tokenized onchain.
    
-   Surpass $1 million in cumulative future revenue tokenized through Dobprotocol.
    
-   Complete at least 2 integrations with DeFi protocols or primitives to enable use cases such as secondary markets, collateralization, or staking.
    
-   Facilitate participation from ecosystem partners and early institutional users leveraging our infrastructure-backed tokens.  
      
    

Primary KPIs:

1.  Total projected revenue tokenized through Dobprotocol (value of future cash flows validated and issued onchain).
    
1.  Total revenue distributed to tokenholders (measured by actual onchain payouts).
    
1.  Performance ratio: percentage of projected revenue that has been successfully paid out onchain.",https://www.dobprotocol.com/,https://github.com/dobprotocol/dobvalidator,https://youtu.be/ffMfuD6Q4lo,Yes,"Dobprotocol is ready to scale. After validating our technical architecture and product-market fit during Stellar Kickstart, we now focus on expanding real-world integrations and onboard infrastructure assets and investors. Our Infra Readiness Sprint sits at the heart of this strategy.

#### Infra Readiness Sprint: Free pre-validation for real-world infrastructure

As part of our Go-to-Market strategy, we offer a fully subsidized Infra Readiness Sprint, funded by Dobprotocol. This consists of a 1–2 hour pre-validation session where our team meets directly with infrastructure operators to assess their project’s financial, technical, and operational readiness for tokenization.

During this session, we provide strategic guidance, review available data, and help determine whether the project is ready to move forward with onchain validation and token issuance. If not, we prepare a readiness report outlining the gaps and next steps to qualify for tokenization in the future.

This program is Dobprotocol’s way of lowering the barrier to entry and ensuring that only serious, well-prepared infrastructure projects advance into our validation pipeline.

#### Validation tiers and pricing model

Post-sprint, operators move into one of three paid validation tiers based on project scale:

Tier: Small

Fee (USD): $4,500

Expected Infrastructure Type: Pilots, installations under $250K

Tier: Medium

Fee (USD): $9,000

Expected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure between $250K–$1M

Tier: High

Fee (USD): $18,000+

Expected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure over $1M or high complexity

These tiers allow us to serve a broad spectrum of projects, from early-stage EV networks to large-scale mining or solar deployments.

Operator traction and early deployments

We’re actively validating and preparing real infrastructure projects for onchain tokenization:

-   eHive (EV chargers): First validator integration completed and ready for tokenization in the Build phase. This marks our first full deployment across the validation and token issuance stack.
    
-   Bas3 (data centers): Validation logic is underway. We’re collaborating closely to complete the data ingestion and scoring process before designing the tokenization structure.
    
-   Solar and mining pipeline: We’ve initiated conversations with key stakeholders in Chile’s energy and mining sectors, including outreach through the Universidad de Chile Mining Engineering alumni network. These sectors attract significant investment at the corporate level, but mid-sized operators and high-potential projects often struggle to access efficient or transparent funding.
    

To extend our reach, we’ve launched a strategic referral program targeting advisors, brokers, and consultants who are already connected to infrastructure operators, especially in mining and renewable energy. These experts often have first hand access to capital hungry projects and can help identify operators that would benefit from tokenizing their future revenue. By offering aligned incentives and a clear onboarding path, we turn industry knowledge into a scalable source of qualified leads and long term ecosystem partners.

#### Revenue model

Our business model is aligned with long-term platform growth and real asset performance. We monetize through:

-   Investment fee: 1.5%, applied when investor funds are transferred and locked into the infrastructure-backed token issuance.
    
-   Management fees: 0.5%, charged on revenue streams distributed through our smart contracts.
    

This dual-fee structure allows us to support infrastructure operators while creating a sustainable model for protocol operations and development.","Since being selected for the Stellar Kickstart cohort on May 3rd, Dobprotocol has demonstrated rapid execution, delivering product, onboarding partners, and validating demand.

Moonlight Protocol,SCF #37,Mainnet Launch of Private Payments,Moonlight Protocol,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$134990.00,$44996.67,110031.26,7/31/2025,Build,Brings private payments to Stellar Mainnet using a UTXO model and provider-mediated channels for compliance and control.,"Before continuing, we strongly recommend watching this demonstration video.

Moonlight provides the full infrastructure and tooling required to enable compliant, privacy-preserving payments on Stellar. We deliver the complete protocol implementation, from smart contracts to SDKs and service frameworks, so ecosystem participants can build, operate, and integrate privacy-enabled services with reduced complexity. Our offering includes:

-   Privacy Channels: On-chain Soroban solutions that maintain private UTXO ledgers, support multi-party bundled transfers, and enforce channel-specific asset and provider policies.
    
-   Trusted Privacy Provider (TPP) Framework: A modular off-chain relayer service that handles authenticated bundle submission. Moonlight provides a compliant-ready base implementation that can be customized and extended to meet specific regulatory needs, such as KYC or sanctions screening.
    
-   Moonlight SDK: A TypeScript library that abstracts UTXO key derivation, balance fragmentation, provider integration, and transaction lifecycle management, simplifying development.
    
-   Reference Wallet: A minimal, open-source client that connects to privacy channels via selected TPPs, enabling users to send private, self-custodied transactions with a unified UX.
    
-   Protocol Governance Layer: Smart contract layer for channel configuration, provider quorum management, and compliance policy enforcement at the protocol level.
    

These components are delivered as open-source tools to reduce the entry curve for wallets, institutions, and service providers. Moonlight makes it easier to integrate privacy on Stellar while maintaining custody, composability, and regulatory flexibility.",https://moonlight-10.gitbook.io/moonlight-docs/readme/whitepaper,"Moonlight’s success will be judged on real usage, growing liquidity, and broadened asset coverage on Stellar Mainnet. We track four signals: provider count, daily transactions, private TVL, and supported assets.

By Month 3 after launch, the system should look alive, not lab-grade: at least 3 production Trusted Privacy Providers, 1 live wallet integration, 25–50 private transfers per day, and roughly $100 000 locked in a single XLM privacy channel.

By Month 6 after launch, we need clear traction: 6 active TPPs, 2 additional wallets or fintech partners, 150–200 daily transfers, over $250 000 held privately, and three assets (likely XLM, USDC, EURCV) flowing through multiple channels. These numbers show that users and liquidity stick around once the novelty wears off.

By Month 12 after launch, network effects should be visible: 10 or more TPPs including at least one regulated institution, 500-plus daily transfers, $1 million in private balances, and 5 assets serviced. Hitting these marks proves Moonlight can scale privacy without draining liquidity from Stellar’s public pools and sets the stage for private Soroban-based DeFi.",https://moonlight-10.gitbook.io/moonlight-docs,https://github.com/Moonlight-Protocol,https://youtu.be/7q2lzW2EXek?si=gObzEiR03Woqu0kc,Yes,"Moonlight’s launch strategy is built around one guiding principle: make privacy on Stellar feel like an overnight upgrade, not a multi-month integration project.

1- Positioning & Core Promise

Moonlight turns any wallet, exchange, or fintech running on Stellar into a privacy-enabled service—without forcing them to cede custody or rewrite their compliance stack. Everything is open source on day one, so the community can inspect, fork, and improve the code as it grows.

2- Early-Mover Focus

We will start with three launch partners already in our pipeline: xBull Wallet (retail users), Palta Labs (infrastructure), and one EU-based institution partner from Aha Labs (e.g. Société Générale, etc). Their combined user base gives us immediate real-world volume and a feedback loop to harden the product before broad release.

3- Three Phases, Twelve Months

-   Developer Preview (Month 1-3) – We maintain one testnet privacy channel (XLM) and publish a TypeScript SDK, reference wallet, and tutorial quests on Stellar Quest.
    
-   Mainnet Pilot (Month 3-4) – After the SDF audit, we deploy audited contracts, activate the first mainnet channel, and register a quorum of three Trusted Privacy Providers (TPPs). Aha Labs also runs its own TPP for redundancy during the launch phase.
    
-   Ecosystem Expansion (Month 4-12) – We add USDC, EURCV, and two regulated assets, invite additional TPPs, and launch a permissionless-provider beta.
    

4- Adoption Channels

We rely on three low-cost levers: (a) co-marketing with partners through blog posts, X Spaces, and Stellar Meridian workshops; (b) hackathon sponsorships (e.g. Dora hackathon style) that award bounties for the best Moonlight integrations; and (c) in-wallet prompts that encourage users to upgrade to private transfers in a single click.

With a tight, phased rollout and concrete early adopters, Moonlight positions itself to become Stellar’s default privacy layer.","Moonlight is already live on the Stellar testnet with a working proof of concept, including deployed Soroban contracts for UTXO-based transaction abstraction and off-chain components that support SEP-10-based authentication and bundle submission. This testnet implementation validates the core architecture and demonstrates the feasibility of compliant, private payments on Stellar. You can watch this demo video for more information.

Moonlight is developed by Aha Labs, a leading Stellar integration partner with a proven delivery record. The team helped Société Générale-FORGE launch the EURCV stablecoin on Stellar, designed key portions of the Soroban/Stellar CLI, and maintains Loam, a Soroban developer toolchain with over 40K downloads across its CLI and SDK (according to Crates.io). Loam is in production or active pilots at firms like EquitX, Ziriz, Société Générale, and others.

Moonlight has strong early interest from the ecosystem. xBull Wallet’s maintainer plans to integrate Moonlight privacy channels in its next release. Key SDF collaborators, including Tyler van der Hoeven and Tomer Weller, have reviewed and endorsed the architecture. Palta Labs has committed to integrating Moonlight once mainnet support is live.

As part of Station F since September 2024, Aha Labs has expanded its European institutional outreach and is already working with multiple financial institutions on tokenization and payments. Moonlight serves as a natural privacy and compliance extension to these ongoing engagements.

Moonlight is also part of the 2025 cohort of the DraperU X Stellar residency program.","#### Deliverable 1: Core Privacy Channel Contracts

Future plans include providing a lightweight SDK for seamless integration into existing wallets and explorers, increasing its accessibility and ecosystem impact. This directly supports Stellar’s goal of growing a strong, tool-rich smart contract development environment.

Our tool is not intended to compete with full-featured explorers like Stellar Expert, but rather to complement them by focusing specifically on transaction visualization, debugging, and Soroban smart contract introspection—features not currently offered in traditional explorers.

While Stellar Expert excels at displaying transaction data and account history, it does not provide a flow-based view or interactive debugging for Soroban contracts. Our tool bridges that gap by offering a developer-friendly visual layer that shows the sequence and relationships between operations, contract calls, and errors.

To avoid duplicating existing explorers, we plan to release an SDK that enables platforms like Stellar Expert, Freighter, or custom dApps to embed our visual flow component or debugging features within their own UI. This modular approach reduces friction and increases adoption, allowing users to access deeper transaction insights without leaving their preferred explorer.

Ultimately, the goal is to integrate rather than compete, making our tool a back-end service and front-end component that can serve the broader Stellar ecosystem and enhance the debugging experience across tools.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5zpEHvipaswRPdukDhHyE9nNvz27XW8qtD_2FrtZkI/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0,"-   Developers can visualize Stellar and Soroban transactions in a clear flow format.

Stellar AI Agent Kit,SCF #37,AI Agent Toolkit: Soroban to MCP ,Stellar AI Agent Kit,Developer Tooling,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$108000.00,$36000.00,90315.76,8/5/2025,Build," Enable secure, AI-powered interaction with Soroban contracts by generating MCP servers and streamlining smart wallet adoption through accessible Policy Signer tools","Executive Summary:  
As AI agents become more prevalent in fintech and automation, developers need secure ways to let those agents interact with blockchain contracts. The Stellar AI Agent Kit offers the first complete toolchain for safely connecting AI agents to Soroban contracts using MCP servers and delegated signer infrastructure.

The Stellar AI Agent Kit is a secure developer toolkit designed to make Soroban contracts safely accessible to AI agents. It enables developers to expose contracts via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, while also providing signer infrastructure and testing tools to ensure predictable, permissioned execution.

Important note: This toolkit does not use LLMs to write or generate contracts. Developers still write their own contracts. The tools in this kit help generate supporting infrastructure—similar to how TypeScript bindings are generated from existing specs—not the core logic.

1. MCP Server Generator (CLI Plugin)

Parses Soroban contract interfaces to generate MCP-compliant server bindings in both TypeScript and Python, following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard.

Impact: This is not an AI tool writing contracts. It’s a developer utility—like TypeScript binding generators—that translates a contract’s existing spec into a format that AI agents can safely understand and call. With Python support, this makes Stellar contracts accessible from AI development platforms like LangChain, OpenAI, and Claude, without any backend boilerplate.

2. Policy Signer Generator (Interactive CLI)

A structured, interactive CLI that generates scoped signer rules from contract interfaces, allowing developers to define secure, rule-based policies for delegated execution.

Impact: This tool does not use AI or natural language processing. It’s a straightforward developer utility—like a configuration assistant—that helps builders define signer logic using structured inputs. By leveraging the Soroban contract spec, it guides developers through permission setup (e.g. function-level access, destination restrictions, quotas) and outputs deployable signer configurations. This eliminates the need to write custom signer logic in Rust, while giving developers full control over what agents are authorized to do. It's an essential bridge to adopt Stellar’s powerful Policy Signers without deep protocol expertise.

3. Policy Sandbox Web App

A visual, browser-based simulator for testing how Policy Signers behave during various contract calls and transactions.

Impact: Before connecting agents to real wallets, developers need to validate their signer logic. The Sandbox allows them to create test wallets, assign policies, simulate contract calls, and observe whether the signer allows or rejects the request—making it easier to debug and onboard safely.

4. MCP Client SDK (npm)

An SDK to simulate transactions, manage delegated signing, and submit them to Stellar, fully integrated with MCP server outputs and smart wallet models.

Impact: This SDK enables real applications—bots, voice agents, UIs—to safely interact with Soroban contracts through previously defined signer rules. With no need for full private key access, apps can execute contract logic within secure, delegated boundaries, guided by the developer’s own permissions setup.

-  

Together, these tools form secure infrastructure—not speculative AI automation. They support developers by reducing boilerplate, enabling safe agent interactions, and enforcing strict contract-level controls across the entire lifecycle.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yk4VSQFQrf35UfSnRO-OpOQ0rxs-dIjlh_GeZK4x_NA/edit?usp=sharing,"Success for this project means delivering a complete, secure, and composable toolchain that allows developers to build AI agents capable of interacting with Soroban smart contracts — regardless of their interface, language, or use case.

We will consider this submission successful when the following criteria are met:

Contract → MCP Server (Language-Agnostic)

-   Developers can convert any Soroban contract into a fully compliant MCP server, using the CLI tool.
    
-   Both TypeScript and Python bindings are supported, enabling integration with a broad range of agent platforms (e.g. OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, ReAct, custom agents).
    
-   **Contracts produce AssembledTransaction XDRs and include auto-generated parameter validation and prompt-ready tool descriptions.  
    **
    

Policy-Based Agent Access

-   Developers can create secure policy signer configurations through the Policy Signer Generator CLI, using only contract specs — no deep Rust/Soroban internals required.
    
-   **Signer logic can be safely tested in the Policy Sandbox Web App, simulating agent-triggered calls before deployment.  
    **
    

Agent SDK Integration

-   The MCP Client SDK allows any AI agent (chat, voice, or backend automation) to:
    
    a.  Discover tool functions from an MCP server,
        
    a.  Simulate transactions,
        
    a.  Sign with the correct delegated key (e.g. a policy signer),
        
    a.  Submit securely to Stellar via MCP-compatible flows.  
        

This means developers can build:

-   Voice-controlled wallets (“Send 10 USDC to my cousin”)
    
-   Chat agents that manage account permissions
    
-   **Automated agents that rebalance portfolios, initiate payouts, or optimize yield  
    — all without needing full access to a private key.  
    **
    

Ecosystem Signals of Success

-   At least 3 live agent demos (chat or voice-based) using the toolchain by external builders or during hackathons.
    
-   MCP CLI plugin is accepted into the Stellar CLI ecosystem or maintained as a widely adopted dev tool.
    
-   Public tooling and server endpoints maintain >99.9% uptime post-mainnet launch, tracked via our status page.",https://stellarsandbox.dev/,https://github.com/JoseCToscano/stellar-ai-demo,https://www.loom.com/share/1d0868ed999d4d1f958390ab2c63cc11?sid=d004d1a2-d010-4d46-bf8b-b8e743ce0cbc,Yes,"This is not a product commercialization campaign. It is a developer-focused release strategy aimed at delivering secure, composable infrastructure that enables AI agents to safely interact with the Stellar network. Our focus is on making Soroban contracts AI-accessible while preserving full developer control through signer policies, simulation tooling, and real-world agent integrations.

Ongoing Collaboration with Stellar’s Product Team

Throughout development, we will work closely with the Stellar Product team to ensure alignment with the ecosystem’s long-term vision. This includes continued collaboration with VP of Product Nick Gilbert and John Canneto, who have already expressed support and emphasized how this work lowers the barrier to entry for new developers while prioritizing security through policy enforcement. Their feedback will guide integration priorities, plugin architecture, and documentation standards.

📦 Developer Adoption (npm)

Since the initial launch of early prototypes:

-   Released 4 npm packages supporting MCP server generation, signer rule creation, and contract metadata parsing.
    
-   Reached 2,047 total downloads in the first 7 weeks.
    
-   Peaked at 837 downloads in a single week, indicating strong early interest.
    
-   Usage has included developers from both AI-first platforms and core Stellar teams testing integration scenarios.  
    

The initial npm distribution strategy was chosen to unblock early adopters while the project matured toward official plugin form. Despite being unofficial, it validated the tooling’s usefulness and accessibility.

🧪 Working Prototypes

-   Built a fully functional CLI tool that transforms Soroban contract specifications into MCP servers, outputting TypeScript interfaces compatible with both Stellar's AssembledTransaction model and Anthropic’s MCP agent standards.
    
-   Deployed and tested a working MCP Server implementation that supports:
    
    -   Agent-initiated transactions.
        
    -   Passkey-based smart wallets.
        
    -   Delegated signing via custom Policy Signers.

Indentura,SCF #37,Stablecoin Credit Lines for SME lending.,Indentura,Financial Protocols,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$120000.00,$40000.00,88803.87,8/13/2025,Build,Rebuilding credit markets on top of stablecoin rails.,"Indentura lets borrowers pledge high-quality offchain collateral and draw on stablecoin credit lines from a global onchain liquidity pool. Our offchain infrastructure gives lenders enforceable legal claims and real-time visibility into collateral while preserving borrower privacy.

Our first product enables speciality lenders to access revolving credit lines to manage cash flow more effectively and also offer similar revolving products to SMEs.

To do so, we’re developing three key pieces of infrastructure:

1.  Soroban Credit Vaults: Vaults that support ERC-4626 behavior on deposit and ERC-7540 on withdrawal, adapted to Soroban’s native architecture. At a high level, a lender deposits Stellar USDC into a vault, and receives in return a yield-bearing receipt/share token representing its position. The vault allocates all deposited capital into whitelisted protocols to generate yield. When a borrow wants to draw down a credit line, a designated MPC wallet calls a function to unwind yield positions and release stablecoins or offramped USD to the borrower. Interest is accrued and tracked on a block-by-block basis. This represents a new asset primitive for the Stellar ecosystem and an adaptable vault standard that leverages best practices from EVM protocols to interface between onchain and offchain capital flows, driving real-world utility to Soroban.
    
1.  Custody and Compliance: Vault depositors require a legal security interest over the collateral backing their credit exposure. Borrowers, in turn, require institutional-grade interfaces, including bank accounts for fund disbursement and MPC wallets to manage on-chain obligations. This demands a legal and operational layer built around bankruptcy-remote SPVs that support custody, loan servicing, and payment flow management on behalf of vault participants. We’re building the robust, institutional-grade bridge required for assets to flow safely between traditional legal structures and the Stellar network.
    
1.  Reporting and Automation: Moving funds from a Stellar USDC vault deposit to a borrower’s bank account involves treasury operations across various systems, including yield management, compliance checks, and disbursements. On repayment, syncing borrower data back to on-chain vault interfaces requires connecting private data warehouses with privacy-preserving pipelines. This infrastructure ensures capital flows and reporting are seamless, secure, and trustworthy for all participants.
    

This grant will allow us to develop and launch these infrastructure components on Soroban, beginning with a live credit facility for a U.S.-based specialty lender. It’s the first step toward building stablecoin-native credit rails that are programmable, transparent, and globally accessible.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIp7U9HXTbqb99xsBUmvB8C96LQXtI57A7fijTXf5v4/edit?usp=sharing,"We’ll consider this build successful if we meet the following criteria:

-   One real-world borrower is live on mainnet, accessing a stablecoin-denominated credit line via Soroban vault infrastructure.
    
-   One lender vault is deployed and capitalized, with $500k of Stellar USDC earning yield via a mix of DeFi strategies and borrower repayment.
    
-   At least one half of a repayment cycle is completed, demonstrating stablecoin flow from vault to borrower and back through fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure.
    
-   All supporting infrastructure is live: custody (MPC), legal structure (SPV), and lender-facing reporting.
    
-   End-to-end flows are auditable via on-chain data and off-chain reporting, ensuring transparency for vault participants and protocol stakeholders.
    

Impact:

This launch will demonstrate that stablecoins can serve as more than just payment rails. They can function as the foundation for programmable, enforceable credit infrastructure. That opens the door to:

-   Improved capital access for businesses excluded from traditional credit.
    
-   New sources of yield for lenders seeking real-world exposure beyond volatile DeFi tokens.
    
-   A new class of financial products on Stellar that serve real economic activity.
    

This deployment will serve as a reference implementation for future vaults and borrowers, laying the foundation for permissionless credit infrastructure across the Stellar ecosystem.",https://www.thawdigital.com/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWE7L7jNR0,Yes,"We’re sequencing our go-to-market by pairing crypto-native capital with real-world borrowers, starting with a market wedge where stablecoin mechanics unlock new products that banks and credit funds can’t offer.

Our distribution strategy scales both capital and credit demand, with each phase unlocking new types of depositors and borrowers. A more detailed view into our 4-phase expansion plan can be found in the Indentura Thesis Document here: https://www.notion.so/indentura/Indentura-Thesis-Document-225c4663170780adb8e5de0045ac1224.

Initial Borrower Strategy

Our first borrower will be a U.S.-based specialty finance company that originates term loans or revenue based financing to small businesses and has expressed explicit demand for a revolving credit structure. We are collaborating directly with this partner to structure the initial facility, validate the legal + off-chain infrastructure, and confirm repayment data flows.

This initial borrower relationship gives us:

-   A controlled underwriting + servicing relationship.
    
-   Clear operational requirements for drawdowns and repayments.
    
-   A proving ground for cross-chain and off-chain capital orchestration.
    

Initial Lender Strategy

Our first vault will be capitalized through closely held sources: the team, advisors, and aligned partners with experience in DeFi and credit underwriting. These stakeholders understand the risk profile and serve as both early liquidity providers and feedback channels.

We especially want to focus on lenders who already have positions in DeFi protocols, as Indentura provides an additional way to stack yield on top of their existing positions.

This demonstrates:

-   Programmatic yield movement between DeFi and borrower capital.
    
-   Stablecoin liquidity that can be committed, drawn down, and repaid.
    
-   Transparent, auditable performance and credit behavior.
    

Future Growth

Once the first facility is live and stable, we will expand across both borrower and lender channels:

-   Borrower side: additional specialty finance firms, fintechs offering embedded credit products, and eventually businesses operating entirely on stablecoins.
    
-   Lender side: crypto-native family offices, DAO treasuries, and eventually fintechs or neobanks embedding Indentura-powered yield products.
    

Over time, we aim to support the creation of permissionless credit vaults, enabling anyone to launch programmable credit pools backed by real-world collateral, with Stellar serving as the primary infrastructure layer for compliance, liquidity, and settlement.","Our approach to validation is grounded in our team’s experience in the credit industry. Our founder, Tom Meister, has structured debt transactions at both funds and fintechs, led legal and operations at unicorn fintech companies, and advised and backed leading DeFi lending protocols. His background gives us confidence that this pain point, the absence of flexible, programmable credit infrastructure, is both acute and systemically underserved.

That perspective led us to validate the problem directly with our target users: nonbank specialty lenders. We’ve already received clear confirmation through direct conversations and formal letters of support, one of which is enclosed below.

The lender, a U.S.-based specialty finance firm originating term loans to SMBs, provided a signed letter describing the structural challenge: they cannot access or offer revolving credit due to limitations in how their capital sources operate, and the inefficiencies of traditional financial rails.

In the letter, their CEO writes:

“If lenders like [us] could draw on a revolving credit facility in stablecoins, we would incur significantly lower interest costs and could pass the savings along to our borrowers... We would be interested in piloting a borrower-facing revolving credit facility backed by stablecoins.”

He also confirms this is an industry-wide issue:

“Virtually none of … businesses [like ours] are able to access revolving bank lines of credit, and so we are forced to obtain term loan credit facilities that present the financial drawbacks I have described above. This puts businesses like [ours], and the small and medium sized businesses we serve, in a much worse position than we would be in if revolving credit were available.”

The full letter is enclosed and signed. We’re currently in active discussions with other specialty lenders facing the same problem and can secure additional letters over the coming weeks, if needed. We have also received interest from a venture philanthropy looking to deploy this type of solution within their market. A copy of their signed letter of support is also attached.

This validation affirms strong borrower demand and growing pull from institutional participants who, while traditionally unfamiliar with crypto, are eager to adopt Stellar-based solutions that solve real-world capital inefficiencies.

SendIN,SCF #36,SendIN [Phase 2],SendIN,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$67000.00,$22333.33,89754.27,6/20/2025,Build,Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments To India,"SendIN is a payments platform built on the Stellar network, designed to revolutionize the process of sending money from the US to India. We make US-to-India money transfers easy, affordable, transparent and lightning-fast without any crypto complexity. Funds can be sent to a recipient’s email, and INR is delivered directly to their Indian bank account within minutes. While the backend leverages Stellar’s low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure, the frontend remains entirely Web2-native. No wallets, seed phrases, or tokens required. SendIN brings the benefits of blockchain to users who never need to know it’s there. The tech’s complex. The experience isn’t.

Previously, we were awarded an activation award to build the phase 1 of our MVP on Stellar. We developed a fully functional application that enables a user in the US to send money to an email address, with the receiver in India getting INR directly in their bank account — all abstracting away blockchain complexity. Key technical accomplishments include:

1.  A complete full-stack app with secure login, auth stack & database with email ↔ wallet mapping.
    
1.  Stellar SDK integration for transactions on the network & creating sponsored addresses.
    
1.  End-to-end money transfer orchestration on Stellar testnet. 
    
1.  Partnerships & integrations with on/off-ramp providers (Kado.money, Onramp.money) to bridge USD ↔ USDC ↔ INR
    
1.  Custodial key management using AWS KMS and delegated signing of transactions
    
1.  Initial implementation of SEP-6 for anchor operations & SEP-12 for KYC storing and passing.
    
1.  Currently accepting users on our waitlist at sendin.app
    

In Phase 2, we’re evolving SendIN from a functional MVP to a production-grade, corridor-scalable payments platform. A key challenge we faced in Phase 1 was the absence of a reliable Stellar anchor in India. After extensive exploration, we partnered with Onramp.money and collaborated with their team to build infrastructure for non-custodial USDC off-ramping—but the service remains SEP non-compliant and lacks full protocol alignment. On the on-ramp side, we had fully integrated with Kado.money, but following its recent acquisition and shift in services, we are now migrating to alternate providers. Phase 2 will address these limitations while expanding our infrastructure, formalizing compliance, and preparing for growth. Features / improvements in this phase include:

1.  Build and deploy India’s first production-grade Stellar anchor to support off-ramping USDC & XLM → INR, including SEP-6, SEP-12, and SEP-31 compatibility.
    
1.  Add dynamic support for multiple on-ramp providers (Banxa, Transak) with backend routing based on user location, availability, and cost.
    
1.  Begin development of a Soroban smart contract layer to enable programmable disbursement logic, revenue-sharing models, and wallet restrictions. All complexity remains fully abstracted from users.
    
1.  Implement passkey-based authentication and migrated to a non-custodial approach by using dfns to use MPC infra for wallets and enhancing security while maintaining seamless UX.
    
1.  Continue onboarding users through the sendin.app waitlist and begin controlled mainnet rollout for transaction flows.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efhFtZHwimFXvQYa7l38adXw9hCUwQ6sRU57J_iD3MA/edit?tab=t.0,"Success for SendIN is defined by both measurable traction and systemic impact.

From a quantitative perspective, we aim to onboard 1000+ users across the US → India corridor within 3 months of mainnet launch, facilitating $200,000+ in cumulative remittance volume. This initial traction will validate product-market fit and prove that web2-native users can adopt a blockchain-powered backend without friction. We expect a growing share of users to be freelancers, remote workers, and NRIs with family ties in India; audiences underserved by traditional remittance channels.

However, the deeper success lies in expanding access. By removing the need for crypto wallets, seed phrases, or exchange accounts, we’re onboarding entirely new cohorts into on-chain finance. The user experience is fully abstracted; money moves on Stellar, but users stay in their comfort zone.

On the infrastructure side, success includes the launch of India’s first SEP-compliant Stellar anchor which is currently a critical missing link in the ecosystem. We are positive that we could also market out the anchor at some point, which then could potentially be adapted by a lot of on-chain products in India",https://sendin.app/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyjobz-N5fBtZEruzPZ23wYjIdxLSWUfLainYLRsPYM/edit?tab=t.0,https://youtu.be/0q1SO3j_40k,Yes,"SendIN will launch in four strategic phases, focused on the US → India remittance corridor, followed by groundwork for UAE expansion. Each phase targets a specific user group, validates infrastructure, and incrementally scales product adoption.

Phase 1 – MVP (Early Q3 2025):  
Launch a minimal product to a small group of pilot users, enabling USD → INR remittances via email. Key goals: complete real transfers using Stellar infrastructure,  validate compliance (KYC, transaction flow), and gather UX feedback.

Phase 2 – Closed Beta (Late Q3 2025):  
Onboard select freelancers, expats, and early adopters from partner networks. Optimize flows and transaction reliability with real-world usage. Referral-based onboarding begins. KYC and INR disbursement experience refined with small-value transfers.

Phase 3 – Full Launch US → India (Q4 2025):  
Launch to the public with full Web2-native UX and Stellar mainnet infrastructure. Users can send USD to emails; INR lands in recipient bank accounts within minutes. Roll out in-app referrals, transparent pricing, and FX efficiency as core value props.

Phase 4 – UAE → India Groundwork (Q1 2026):  
Begin integrating multi-currency backend logic and initiate partnerships with UAE-based payment providers. Build compliance readiness for corridor expansion.  
  
Acquisition Channels:

-   Partner with freelancer platforms (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr)
    
-   In-app referral incentives for NRI users and diaspora communities
    
-   Tie-ups with alumni networks, Indian expat orgs
    
-   BD with remote payroll tools (e.g. Deel)
    
-   Content marketing on cost-saving, remittance pain points","SendIN was awarded an SCF Activation Award during SCF #27, which allowed us to build and rigorously test an almost full-featured prototype on Stellar testnet. Since then, our project has steadily validated both technical and market feasibility. To date, over 550 users have joined our waitlist, primarily Indian-origin freelancers, remote workers, and expats. This growth has been entirely organic: driven through Discord, fintech Twitter, diaspora communities, and word of mouth, without any paid marketing. For privacy and compliance reasons, we are unable to share individual user data publicly, but we maintain all relevant KYC and waitlist submissions securely on our backend.

To further validate user needs, we conducted 30+ structured interviews with potential angel users and stakeholders in the remittance space, which shaped our onboarding and product design. These conversations revealed deep dissatisfaction with existing payment rails and strong excitement for a faster / cheaper experience. We found out people don’t really care about the tech behind given that it’s powerful & safe.

On the institutional side, we've also been approached by multiple early-stage VCs and fintech scouts, intrigued by our positioning at the intersection of Web2 usability and blockchain-native infra. These conversations are ongoing but signal real interest from the capital side once we’re closer to mainnet traction.

SendIN was also invited to pitch at Stellar Meridian 2024 in London, where the project received enthusiastic feedback from members of the Stellar Development Foundation, ecosystem founders, and protocol engineers. Together, these signals, a growing waitlist, structured validation, ecosystem visibility, and investor interest, reflect early traction for a product that solves a real, painful problem in a $15B+ corridor.","Deliverable 1: Passkey-Based Auth & Delegated Signing

Sentinel Protocol ,SCF #36,Flight Delay Parametric Insurance,,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$128000.00,$42666.67,147421.39,7/10/2025,Build,"Parametric insurance framework for any risk, starting with flight delay coverage using reliable oracles and smart contract payouts","Traditional indemnity insurance is pulling back in the face of rising climate risks. In 2024, climate-related disasters caused 94 billion dollars in U.S. losses, according to NOAA. Major insurers like State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers have exited or paused new business in states like California. Chubb, Travelers, and USAA each reported over 1 billion dollars in wildfire-related losses. As a result, parametric insurance is gaining traction as a faster and more transparent alternative. The California State Assembly recognized its potential in a recent insurance reform report.

Sentinel Protocol is a modular parametric insurance framework built on the Soroban blockchain. It connects users seeking protection with DeFi investors who underwrite risk in exchange for yield. Smart contracts and decentralized oracles automate claims and payouts, removing intermediaries and ensuring transparency at every step.

The protocol can support any real-world risk where reliable oracle data is available. Our first product is Flight Delay Insurance, which pays users automatically if their flight is delayed beyond a set threshold. The product launches first on Testnet, followed by a Closed Beta on Mainnet, with a streamlined user interface for travelers and a dashboard for capital providers.

We began with the Kickstart Grant, which helped us validate Sentinel’s technical foundation. While we have made meaningful progress, there is still much to build. You can find a detailed update on our technical progress and roadmap in the Technical section.

Built natively on Soroban, Sentinel Protocol uses:

-   Soroban Smart Contracts to automate all core operations including deposits, claims, and payouts.
    
-   Acurast Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to deliver real-time, tamper-resistant data to the blockchain.
    
-   Stellar SDKs used to connect liquidation bots and keepers that advance the protocol's state and coordinate interactions seamlessly.
    

We are open-sourcing the Sentinel Protocol framework to support the Soroban developer community, offering reusable components like modular vaults, oracle pipelines for Web2 data, and automation tools such as liquidation bots and keepers. Alongside this, we’re releasing documentation, tutorials, and videos to help others build or extend Sentinel for new DeFi use cases. The framework is flexible and designed for easy deployment of parametric insurance products across diverse risk markets, with the goal of disrupting traditional insurance and enabling others to build on top of it.

Our market contract includes a configurable commission fee that allows the deployer to earn revenue as a creator or intermediary. Whether we plan to monetize the open-source framework by charging other teams is still open for discussion and experimentation.

In short, Sentinel Protocol provides the following:

-   For the developer community:
    
    -   A reusable ERC-4626 style vault standard for any DeFi project on Soroban
        
    -   Oracle integration using Acurast TEE to securely fetch Web2 API data
        
        -   Among the first implementations bringing Acurast to Soroban
            
        -   Expands oracle capabilities beyond on-chain asset prices (e.g., flight data, fire zones)
            
    -   Example liquidation bots and keepers to automate contract state progression
        
    -   Full developer support with documentation, tutorials, and example integrations
        
-   For DeFi yield seekers:
    
    -   Earn yield by underwriting real-world risks
        
    -   Transparent vaults with automated payouts
        
    -   Uncorrelated returns tied to actual insurance demand
        
-   For insurance buyers:
    
    -   Easy-to-use UI to purchase protection
        
    -   Instant, automated payouts triggered by real data
        
    -   No middlemen, claims, or delays",https://github.com/SentinelFi/build_36_submission/blob/main/technical.md,"'-   Flight Delay Insurance is live as a Closed Beta on Soroban mainnet, built on top of Sentinel Protocol—an on-chain, trustless, and automated parametric insurance framework.
    
-   Investors gain access to real-world asset (RWA) yield opportunities through flight insurance markets, backed by a detailed yield study demonstrating capital sustainability.
    
-   Developers benefit from a standardized Vault primitive and a modular oracle pipeline for bringing verifiable Web2 non-financial data on-chain via Acurast TEEs.
    
-   The protocol is ready to onboard other teams building insurance products in new verticals, including but not limited to fire coverage, hail damage, crop yield protection, and earthquake insurance.",https://sentinel-finance.vercel.app/,https://github.com/SentinelFi#-sentinel-protocol-repositories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GoTO3bqBcw,Yes,"We have an ambitious goal: to disrupt the parametric insurance market by leveraging Soroban to bring transparency, automation, and trustless execution to an industry that remains opaque and slow. While six months and a limited budget are not enough to realize the full vision, this phase gives us a strong foundation to prove product-market fit, engage early partners, onboard beta testers, and demonstrate the viability of on-chain insurance.

As we move forward, we are laying out the next evolution of the Sentinel framework and developing clear strategies to capture market share across high-impact insurance verticals.

🛠️ Future Plans for the Framework

-   Integrate Reclaim Protocol or similar zkTLS frameworks to enable zero-knowledge proofs of personhood and actions like flight ticket purchases.
    
-   Join accelerators like Draper University, Tachyon, or a16z Crypto Startup School to raise funding, and grow the team for accelerated development.
    
-   Explore additional TEE platforms like Phala Network and Lit Protocol to ensure flexibility and long-term reliability beyond Acurast.
    
-   Build a more resilient Oracle layer by averaging data from multiple APIs to improve accuracy and reduce dependency on single sources.
    

📈 Ideas to Capture Market Share

Our first product targets the flight delay insurance market, valued at 1.37 billion USD in 2024, growing at 14.5 % CAGR, per Business Research Insights. We aim to capture early market share by getting real users into live parametric markets—starting with Flight Delay Insurance.

Since receiving the Kickstart Grant, our two-person developer team has been focused on shipping. We’ve made significant technical progress on Sentinel Protocol, a modular on-chain insurance framework built on Soroban. Highlights include:

-   Built a modular ERC-4626 equivalent vault standard, ready for internal use. View the repo.
    
    -   ERC‑4626 style vault contracts are rapidly gaining adoption, with usage up 32.23% since October 2024 according to Glider data by Hexensio (source). This shows that developers are increasingly looking for shared, plug-and-play standards for interest-bearing assets. It's a strong signal that Soroban has an opportunity to capture this momentum by supporting DeFi protocols that rely on vault primitives.
        
-   Collaborating with OpenZeppelin to contribute the vault to their Soroban token library. Opened Issue, PR to follow
    
-   Integrated Acurast TEE with Soroban for secure Web2 data feeds. Integration code
    

We’ve also validated real use cases and built functional prototypes:

-   We have built Hedge/Risk Market based on vault primitive. Contract Code
    
-   General Hedge and Risk Market UI built and ready for testing, designed to support multiple parametric insurance markets including Flight Delay Insurance. View UI and the UI Code
    
-   Fire Insurance prototype using NASA FIRMS satellite data on top of our framework to demonstrate that given oracle data, we can build Parametric Insurance (Hedge Market) on any vertical. Project link
    
-   We’ve engaged with teams exploring new verticals on top of the Sentinel framework, including a project focused on crop insurance for drought risk in West Africa - they are in the process of applying to Kickstarter Round 11.
    
-   We conducted 12 user interviews at ETHDenver 2025, and during the Kickstart Week including DeFi yield seekers and insurance buyers.
    

Early simulations show strong yield potential across multiple insurance verticals, indicating a sustainable model for risk investors:

-   Flight delay insurance, modeled using over 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with delay probabilities from 1% to 20%, shows a median yield of 96.11% at a 3-hour delay threshold. Flight delay yield analysis
    
-   1,000 properties with $3,000 annual premiums and $150,000 payouts were simulated with fire probabilities between 0.3% and 1.7%. Across thousands of runs, the average annual yield ranged from 40% to 50%, showing consistent profitability despite risk variability.. Fire Insurance Yield analysis
    

With the Build Award, we will complete the remaining infrastructure and then shift our focus to onboarding insurance buyers and capital providers—testing live markets, validating sustainable yields, and accelerating real-world adoption.","'-   Total Budget: $41,600

There, we discovered that high transaction fees frustrated many users, prompting us to prioritize affordability. This experience, aligned with Stellar’s mission of accessible finance, gave birth to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Since launching in March 2023, we’ve achieved the following metrics while bootstrapping, with our P2P feature and payment system going live in Q4 2024 after wining Stellar Kickstart grant of $15,000. Beside User Growth, all data provided is from Q4 2024 to April 2025, reflecting rapid early growth:

User Growth: Acquired 14,210 users organically (zero CAC) through social media, referrals, events, and word of mouth from March 2023 to April 2025, leading to 1,795 Active Users. This represents a 12.6% conversion rate from acquired users to active users.

Transactions: Processed $75,000 across 1,967 transactions, averaging $38 per transaction.

Revenue: Generated $1,360 from a 1.1%–1.6% transaction fee depending on the transaction type and 50% of revenue from an ad-driven reward system, where users earn incentives for engaging with ads to offset transaction fees. This early revenue validates our model’s potential.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): We are actively calculating LTV as we refine our monetization strategy with early estimates at $10 per active user based on transaction frequency.

Despite limited resources, we’ve maintained lean operations by leveraging free marketing channels and are exploring partnerships with local fintechs, telcos and small business owners to scale user acquisition. Moving forward, we plan to boost our activation rate to 20% through enhanced onboarding with in-app tutorials and scale revenue to $5,000 monthly by Q3 2025 by introducing new revenue streams.

Meanwhile, we are excited to share a mainnet demo we released for our integration so far.","Kindly find the link to our overall budget here for a detailed breakdown.

It will enable:

-   Risk Scoring: Stellar addresses and transactions will receive real-time AML risk scores based on origin, destination, and behavioral patterns, helping users assess counterparty risk at scale.(Our KYT engine includes a poisoning detection feature to identify low-value attack transactions used to pollute wallet histories — this will be extended to Stellar if applicable.)
    
-   Know Your Transaction/Know Your Address Reports: Users will generate downloadable reports for Stellar addresses and transactions to support regulatory audits, internal reviews, or investigations.

-   All features are accessible via API, enabling integration into third-party systems, dashboards, and internal tools
    

To provide additional context on usage: although Stellar is not yet officially supported in Scorechain’s platform, we’ve observed that 20 companies have already attempted to perform Stellar KYT scoring using our API and tools. These scoring attempts resulted in no output, as Stellar isn’t yet integrated — but they clearly indicate real and unsolicited interest in monitoring Stellar addresses.

In total, over 44,000 Stellar-related scoring calls have been made to our platform, showing that users are actively exploring Stellar as a chain to monitor. This demand reinforces the relevance of the integration and validates the need from our existing client base and prospects.

The Scorechain team combines deep experience in blockchain compliance, product development, and growth strategy. Our CEO Pierre Gérard has been building in the open-source and crypto space since the early 2000s, launching Scorechain in 2014 from La Maison du Bitcoin. CTO Grégoire Marchal has led the platform’s architecture for nearly a decade, while CMO Ignacio Aguirre brings 15+ years in marketing across Web3, DeFi, and fintech. Julien Gobbi, our CPO, drives product strategy with a strong background in SaaS and compliance platforms, and certified Kubernetes expert Denis Santangelo leads our DevOps. This experienced, multidisciplinary team has delivered live blockchain analytics products across 19 chains, trusted by 350+ clients worldwide.","Data Gathering & Preparation

-   Beta access for ambassadors and early adopters
    
-   Public mainnet release with press, social media and partnership content
    

#### 2. Influencer & Media Strategy

To drive awareness and trust, we are currently raising equity funds from top-tier Web3 influencers and educators in the French-speaking and international ecosystem, including:

-   Hasheur (YouTuber, investor, founder of Meria)
    
-   Cryptopicsou (educator and technical explainer on blockchain)
    
-   Cryptoast (leading crypto media in France)
    

These figures will act not only as investors, but also as distribution multipliers. Through their YouTube channels, newsletters, and X (Twitter) accounts, they will create tailored content that highlights:

-   The benefits of learning through StellarMap Academy
    
-   The ability to earn XP and NFTs through an accessible quest system
    
-   The larger vision of VenaLabs as a gamified on-chain learning infrastructure
    

We plan to support these campaigns with a well-produced explainer video, shared across channels.

#### 3. Client Partnerships and Ecosystem Leverage

We already have signed partnerships with XRPL and iExec, for whom we are developing similar onboarding and mapping solutions. These relationships validate our model and allow us to:

We provide builders a single place to go to access all the data providers they need to build, while saving them money and headaches with our proprietary smart-routing algorithms.","Uniblock gives developers the ""batteries included"" experience. Our tooling brings together different data providers and enable builders to simplify their tech stack and the operational complexity they need to manage as they build and operate their projects.

We provide a single place to go to access all the data needed. This can be APIs to check transaction history, token price, market data, and more. We are also able to stitch together the various data providers to create a wholistic experience -- for example, when SimpleHash was acquired recently and went offline, our users were able to continue without disruption as we brought endpoints from 6 different providers into one place to provide 98% coverage for the gap that SimpleHash left. Without Uniblock, developers need to struggle to talk to each of the different providers, read all of their documentation, and then contract and pay monthly invoices from all the different providers they work with.

Our business is in understanding the data provider landscape, negotiating the best enterprise agreements, and bringing it all together into a simple and easy to use experience for developers. And on top of that, we add an AI routing layer that intelligently routes data requests to the provider that is offering the best price and best latency. We also automatically detect failures and outages and move project data requests to the next-best provider; minimizing outages and downtime that affect the end-users of applications, while also taking away the need for projects to build this redundancy (and the need to pay for backups that may never be used) away from projects.

Additional Information added: 
1. With indexers such as Goldsky, we will run 1 indexer account in Uniblock backend. We will then allow users to have one billing system under Uniblock without having to pay for a separate indexer account. We will wrap around the indexer CLI and create a new Uniblock-indexer CLI to provide all functionalities. In addition, we will create a copy of indexer query studio for graphql queries

2. While most Stellar Horizon providers truncated its historical data to one year, as long as there exists providers that provide complete historical data, we can aggregate it. For example, we can work with Bitquery https://explorer.bitquery.io/stellar/operations and other similar api providers as backup

3. The value of Uniblock, and the issue in the industry that we are solving for developers, is that we eliminate the need to have costly secondary and tertiary agreements with other providers that are only used in the event of an outage of the primary provider. 

Uniblock's infrastructure is run on GCP (Google) and has benefits from this stable, as near as possible to 100%, uptime. Our customers do not need additional providers as Uniblock is more stable than even having 2, 3, or even more backup RPC providers.",https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ffc4041w3orjg0LLCmYaFCgdVXXapPcPhmEdXEyTcDM/edit?usp=drive_link,"Qualitatively, success for Uniblock on Stellar looks like hundreds or thousands of builders on Stellar using Uniblock to support their data needs. It looks like builders not having to struggle with different transaction streams across Stellar and Soroban, it looks like a better experience and more complete data for indexers, it looks like builders saving money money over month as they benefit from our auto-router, sending their requests for data to the best priced and best performant data providers.

Quantitatively, we are happy to work with Stellar to define particular metrics as it relates to either usage of specific providers, unification and usage of specific types of tools (e.g., RPCs, Indexers, API providers), levels of engagement as it relates to our ecosystem of builders using Uniblock on other chains, etc. We want Stellar to see immediate value from Uniblock integration, and will work with you to define the metrics that are important to you, and use the funding available to us to pursue those metrics.",https://www.uniblock.dev/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVhX2BGX_GKY2wTHBW2B1-YEVP5wRnfKcjCS09T3IUw/edit?usp=drive_link,https://youtu.be/rXA7-rWddKo,Yes,"Uniblock has an existing go-to-market strategy that encompasses:

Meta Contracts in Stellar,SCF #36,First batch of Meta Contracts,,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$26400.00,$8800.00,18826.42,7/16/2025,Build,A set of Meta Contracts apps developers can use to make complex contract invocations without needing to deploy their own contracts,"A set of ""Meta Contracts"" developers can use thanks to a Typescript SDK that makes the process easier. In total, we will introduce 4 (plus the one already created), having different contracts for each type allows developers to just pick the one they need instead of loading one big heavier contract. These contracts are:

-   Atomic call (the one already created): A contract that executes multiple calls in the same contract call and throws an error if one of them fails, this simulates the way in the classic side an app can execute multiple operations with the safety of rejecting the whole transaction if one of them fails.
    
-   Optional succeed call: A contract that lets you send multiple contract calls without where you can decide if it's ok for some of them to fail, an example where this might be useful is when an arbitrager wants to send multiple calls where the goal is to get as many as possible accepting if one or more of them fail.
    
-   Conditional calls: A contract that lets developers execute transactions where based on the result from one of the calls it decides what to do next, this allows simulating a classic ""if this then that"" logic.
    
-   Chain flow call: A contract that lets you take the result of one call and inject that result into the following contract call.
    
-   Mega call: A contract that has all of the other contract features included and lets the developer use them in the configuration needed, this will be in fact the heavier contract but there are situations where it helps. For example, a developer wants to withdraw from a pool and after that, it wants to get the balances from two assets to later use the result from both calls to fund another different pool, all of that will be possible without that developer needing to upload its own contract.",https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Router-Contract,"If others main protocols use them that will be a success, for example we could use one of them with the Blend front end in order to reduce the amount of simulations calls when fetching all the balances from the RPCs.",https://jsr.io/@creit-tech/stellar-router-sdk,https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Router-SDK,https://null.com,Yes,"Meta contract are inmutable contracts that once they are deployed they are all set and no other plan is needed, once they are public we will follow the same we have done with our other libraries like the Stellar Wallets Kit where we share them in our socials and show them to other developers (that beside using them in our own products).","It all started from a tweet from Tomer that gave us the idea of more ""meta contracts"" that could be created, the first one was a router that allows developers to ""simulate"" the atomicity of the classic side on Soroban, but it was created to test an idea from Leigh shared in the Stellar discord regarding fetching multiple balances without needing to do multiple simulations (something useful for our smart wallet).

It integrates with AI tools that assess whether a business respects regulations like GDPR, the EU AI Act, and other emerging AI governance frameworks.

These compliance certificates are issued as non-transferable NFTs and recorded on a decentralized registry, making them instantly verifiable by regulators, auditors, or partners. The platform is particularly suited for AI systems used in high-stakes environments — such as finance, healthcare, or legal — where transparency, traceability, and protection against fraud or misuse are essential.

We chose Stellar not just for its technical reliability, but because it is a robust and institution-focused blockchain, already used in regulated environments such as banking and financial services. This makes it the ideal infrastructure to support adoption by enterprises and public institutions seeking secure, auditable compliance solutions.D",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4THPZpVQSGb2ADFEyP418oM-y6C8mfXZSpyHvEkgHM/edit?tab=t.0,"Success for AITT is defined by both measurable adoption and meaningful impact on regulatory transparency in AI.

    -   Provide a nice and useful Web UI
        

Each vulnerability entry is classified with metadata to support granular filtering and sorting.

-   Organized Data: Provide advanced search, filtering, classificaiton by seveirty, type, project / platform origin and so on
    
    -   Research is useless if you can't find an answer. We will collect, organize and maintain this information.
        
-   Knowledge Transfer: Encourage knowledge & best practices sharing between Stellar users, developers and experts
    
    -   Once interest, usage and content of the knowledge base is refined we hope it will be THE link people share with new builders instead of a random collection of links that happen to be on the mind of the informer at the time. One direct starting point.
        
-   Moderated Community Submissions: Encourage community contributions of new findings or reports while ensuring data integrity through moderation
    
    -   User account creation
        
    -   Role system: Admins, contributors, moderators & viewers Community submissions and support is greatly encouraged. Due to security reasons we want to ensure that the reported data is accurate to maintain security for the Stellar ecosystem.
        

We also understand the use of Stella in the Stellar Developers discord.

If we are able to freely access the api of Stella we will further integrate it with the knowledge base.

Some of these additional features might include:

-   Additional sources for Stella to utilize. While writing this submission Stella was helpful, but did not point us to many relevant up-to-date resources
    
-   More accurate & defined descriptions to educate users with
    

We believe access to this knowledge and continuous knowledge transfer will create a succicnt starting point not just for new users; also a place for experts to return to and share their extensive knowledge without unneccesary obfuscation. It will highlight common vulnerability patterns and recommended mitigations, helping developers avoid known mistakes. Important data such as vulnerabilities, edge cases and uncommon errors should not require extensive time to discover. As information is currently fragmented across various channels, we hope this knowledge base will remove a lot of friction for existing developers, auditors and Stellar projects.

Services:

-   Continuity: We will maintain, host and monitor the Security Catalogue
    
-   Report: As new security flaws, hacks or other issues occur we will highlight their impact

Ecosystem Security Tool usage & Awareness Community Engagement

Ecosystem Security-

By providing access to security reports, common issues and vulnerabilties in a unified, organized manner, it will be be a tremendous resource for the Soroban developer community.

It will be a direct place to point to for maintaining Stellar security. By flagging and understanding potential issues, we can secure Stellar even further.

Tool usage & Awareness -

Having developers using and sharing content from the knowledge base will be important.

We can also observe the amount of registered accounts & website visits.

Community Engagement-

Receiving valuable feedback from developers, users and Stellar projects is crucial.

We want to build a tool that will be used, improved and help prevent critical errors, not another impractical site that goes unused.",https://github.com/Inferara/soroban-security-catalogue,https://github.com/Inferara/soroban-security-catalogue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brnYC6PXzeA,Yes,"Our go-to-market plan is a bit different than traditional products and services on Soroban. This type of development tooling is focusing specificially on curating data, educating users and engaging with the community to use it. The main 2 users are individual developers & auditors. Both of these include experts to Soroban as well as newer users. The experts can stay aware of existing & future vulnerabilities, whereas the newer developers can benefit from a well documented set of resources to start their development journey using Soroban.

Though individual use cases for the Security Catalog can vary greatly, we have identified some key ways we will reach users.

For developers:

-   Direct access to the knowledge base
    
-   Inform developers via Stellar developer discord, webinars & in person events
    
-   Participate in Stellar developer meetings
    
-   Provide existing documentation support & maintenance for Inference
    
-   Create educational content to showcase how to apply the informaiton in the security catalog (Videos, articles etc.)
    
-   Further engage with the community through discord & other relevant channels
    

For Auditors:

-   Similar actions as above, simply curated to auditors
    
-   Provide ecosystem reports of common issues we discover in order to educate potential users & existing auditors
    

For Others:

-Get them to help spread the word :)","Traction Evidence:

Being a rather new concept our traction is still building. We hope to bring more attention to this topic as more opportunities to disuss it arise. As we are building the Security Catalog for Soroban users, we hope to hear feedback from Stellar users in order to collaborate!

Here are some interested individuals on our post in the #ideas-rfp section of the Stellar Developers Discord https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1373603762924556340

Our team has a strong foundation of experience and knowledge even outside the scope of this particular project.

We will divert our attention from our current research of the inference programming language to focus on this security knowledge base. Since verification driven programming is extremely niche and complex topic, we believe it's best to showcase our capabilities in a way that is easier understood first. That is why we are focusing first on tools & information that can be readily used by Stellar developers. That tool being this Security Catalogue.

Blux,SCF #36,Blux React &amp; JS packages and Dashboard,,Developer Tooling,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$81000.00,$27000.00,108719.46,6/24/2025,Build,Provides a complete Stellar wallet kit to help apps onboard users with or without a wallet and interact with Stellar blockchain.,"Blux is a frontend package that helps developers integrate Stellar support into their applications. It takes care of logins, transaction signing, sending and receiving assets, on and off ramping, user analytics, and provides a set of custom hooks and helper functions that make it faster and easier to build on Stellar. By abstracting away low-level wallet integrations and offering a simple but flexible setup, Blux reduces development time and lowers the barrier for developers looking to build applications on Stellar, which in turn helps expand the network with more usable, polished tools.

Blux starts with a login modal that acts as the main entry point for users. This is where users choose how they want to log in, and it supports all the major Stellar wallets like Freighter, Albedo, xBull, and more. Developers can customize this modal fully—changing the layout, logo, color theme, or even the order of wallets shown. Blux also supports cold wallets like Ledger and Trezor, allowing for broader access and improved security for power users. This range of supported wallets, along with customization options, helps developers create user-friendly login experiences that match the look and feel of their app, ultimately making Stellar more accessible to new and returning users.

Once a user logs in, they are shown a profile modal. This modal includes useful features like sending and receiving tokens, viewing transaction history, seeing asset balances, and accessing on and off ramps. Features like asset swapping and viewing recent operations will be added soon. These built-in features allow users to interact with Stellar directly within the application without needing to jump to external tools or manage transactions manually, which improves user retention and creates a smoother, more complete Stellar app experience.

Under the hood, Blux provides a full set of custom React hooks like useBalance, useAccount, useTransactions, useOperations, and useSendTransaction, as well as many others. These hooks allow developers to pull real-time data from Horizon and Soroban without having to write boilerplate code or manage state manually. For teams that don’t use React, Blux also offers a vanilla JavaScript version with the same core features. Both versions are published on NPM and are fully open source. These tools give developers easier access to real-time Stellar data and allow for cleaner, more reliable app logic, helping developers of all skill levels build on Stellar faster and with fewer errors.

All apps built with Blux can be managed through the Blux Dashboard at https://dashboard.blux.cc. This is where developers can register their apps and generate their API keys, configure allowed domains, set up allowlists to make apps invite-only, and use blocklists to restrict access from specific accounts, regions, emails, or phone numbers. The dashboard also allows developers to change visual themes, add terms of service prompts, and control login options. These settings give developers full control over the behavior and accessibility of their apps, which increases security, enables experimentation, and gives app creators more confidence to build on Stellar.

The developer dashboard also includes a “Users” tab that provides a snapshot of user activity. Developers can view how many users logged in over time, which wallets were used, where the users came from, and at what times they accessed the application. This data helps developers understand their audience and monitor usage trends, which is valuable for making improvements, pitching to investors, and building user-first Stellar apps that serve real needs.

To help onboard users who don’t have a wallet or don’t understand crypto, Blux supports logins via email and SMS. This feature uses OTPs and works even in test environments, allowing developers to quickly simulate flows during local development. By making it possible to log in without a wallet, Blux helps onboard non-technical users and opens the door to a wider audience that might otherwise be intimidated by crypto tools, increasing the potential reach of Stellar apps.

Blux also supports login through passkeys, as well as social login providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and more. These accounts are linked to Stellar accounts behind the scenes, allowing users to sign and send transactions even if they don’t know anything about blockchain. This gives developers an easy way to build apps for mainstream users while still relying on the core Stellar tech stack, helping bring Stellar to people outside of the crypto-native crowd.

The documentation is being finalized and will walk developers through every step of integrating Blux, from installation to customization, including how to use all the hooks, helpers, and platform features. The goal is to provide a clear path for anyone who wants to use Stellar in their project. This improves developer onboarding, reduces confusion, and increases the chances that projects built on Stellar will succeed and stay active.

Blux is fully open source, and all of its code is published across multiple repositories on GitHub. Unlike some wallet infrastructure tools like Privy, we believe in transparency and invite the Stellar community to look at how everything works, open issues, suggest improvements, or contribute code. This helps build trust in the tools powering Stellar apps and gives developers more confidence that the platform is secure, maintained, and future-proof.

Customization is a key priority in Blux. Developers can even define and plug in their own login methods if the built-in options don’t meet their needs. This flexibility ensures that Blux is compatible with any kind of Stellar app, whether it’s a DeFi tool, a payments platform, an NFT project, or something else entirely. Supporting such a wide range of use cases helps foster innovation in the Stellar ecosystem and ensures that developers aren’t limited by rigid tools.

Blux is completely free to use for now. In the future, we plan to offer advanced features in the developer dashboard that will be part of a paid version. These features will not replace or restrict the existing free functionality and will be announced publicly when ready. Offering a freemium model ensures that everyone can use Blux without friction, while also giving power users the option to access advanced tools if they need them, which supports long-term sustainability of the platform and helps more professional apps grow on Stellar.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1we-c04geP7q_19DRhaQSfjTO8cwkpOZtv4HaruymM/edit?tab=t.mwhhaq6w450h,"Developer Adoption: Reach 20 Stellar projects integrating Blux into their applications within 3 months of launch.

User Activity: Support at least 3,000 user logins through wallet, social, email, SMS, or passkey.

Wallet Coverage: Maintain full support for 90%+ of active Stellar wallets (hot and cold) and ensure compatibility with all integrated dApps.

Developer & User Feedback: Actively engage developers and users via X and Discord to gather feedback and crowdsource potential security issues.

Ecosystem Impact: Establish Blux as the go-to wallet kit for Stellar by reducing onboarding friction, supporting diverse login methods, and offering seamless wallet integration, all while remaining open source and customizable.

Sustainability: Maintain an open-source codebase on GitHub and secure partnerships for long-term support, visibility, and ongoing development.",https://blux.cc,https://github.com/bluxcc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUgYLCPBqc,Yes,"Our strategy focuses on activating Stellar-based developers and onboarding new builders and users by positioning Blux as the go-to wallet kit for Stellar dapps.

Interlinked is a decentralized short link platform powered by Soroban and the Stellar blockchain. It implements subscription-based model and makes URLs smarter, safer and more transparent by storing them directly on-chain:

-   Short URLs
    
    Users can generate both permanent and temporary links via website or API. Link data is stored on-chain and the duration of temporary links can be customized while being powered by the Soroban smart contracts.
    
-   Community-based moderation
    
    As the links are stored publicly on-chain, this provides an opportunity for a bounty program, where users can flag suspicious links. In case the link turns out to be malicious, the user that found it gets rewarded.
    
-   Visual analytics dashboard
    
    Track clicks, user behaviour, and campaign performance through a rich visual dashboard - all powered by transparent, on-chain data. The amount of clicks is tracked by transferring assets for each redirect - making the whole process transparent and promoting Interlinked for marketing with pay-per-click model.
    
-   No-Code Plugin Integrations
    
    Integration with Wix and Shopify makes it easy for E-commerce businesses to integrate Interlinked and drive further adoption of Soroban.
    

Impact on Stellar

-   E-commerce
    
-   Influencers
    
-   Stellar-based projects
    

Security and risk-management:

-   Users can flag suspicious links, and we’ll run a bounty program to incentivize responsible reporting and add another layer of community-driven moderation.
    
-   Admins will review and block links and accounts suspected in malicious activity.
    
-   Using smart contract ensures that no data can be deleted or changed in case of a cyberattack.
    

Open-source commitment:

-   The core smart contract is already open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, available on GitHub.
    
-   All future updates will be published in real-time, not post-launch.
    
-   Development happens in public with:
    
    -   Open-sourced Github
        
    -   A contributor channel in our Discord to support new devs and onboard contributors.
        

Go-to-market:

Pre-launch:

-   Connect with companies on conferences, LinkedIn and Stellar community.","Trend validation:

The URL-shortening industry powers everything from social medias to E-commerce with a market cap of $8 billion. Yet, the market shows a need in a more cost-effective and better product:

-   Web3 shorteners like w3.do and durl.dev already exist - proving demand for decentralized alternatives
    
-   Stellar has no Web3-native URL shortener, despite Soroban’s potential in terms of speed, transaction fees and more.
    
-   Trend alignment: Interlinked is at the intersection of two rising trends:
    
    -   The URL-shortening market is projected to reach $30 billion by 2033.
        
    -   Adoption of Web3 infrastructure is accelerating due to growing concerns around censorship, ownership, and transparency.
        
-   Competitive edge: Due to Soroban's storage model and data being read directly from the ledger, Interlinked has a much lower cost for operating and maintaining.
    

Partnerships & Early adoption:

Birdhouse Technology, a Stellar-based RWA platform, has actively used Interlinked for social media posts, attracting 60+ on-chain clicks over the last week.

-   Clicks and transaction history is publicly available on stellar expert: https://inl.one/ha/9. To find the amount of clicks for each link: simply check the amount of assets with the unique link code!
    
-   Social media post example: https://inl.one/ha/aa
    

Additionally, it has received early interest from:

1.  APS money(https://aps.money/): A global payment system with over 10 million total transactions processed. Listed as one of the Stellar anchors: https://anchors.stellar.org/.
    
1.  Local Express(https://localexpress.io/): A US-based E-commerce grocery platform for food retailers.
    

These signals indicate real-world interest and use cases within payments, marketing, and commerce even before mainnet launch.

Early traction:

In under two months, Interlinked has gone from a concept to a functional product: feel free to try the MVP on our website and check out the following features:

-   Short link generation with a clean UI.
    
-   Soroban-powered click tracking.
    
-   Webauth login using biometrics and private key generation.
    
-   Publicly-available smart contract deployed on Stellar testnet.
    

All links are written on-chain using Soroban, with click tracking tied to the number of tokens for each unique shortened code. While still early, our testnet service has already recorded over 100 clicks - entirely organic.","Since our previous submission, we have already implemented several core features of the MVP:

LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-chain Oracle,SCF #36,LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-Chain Oracle,LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-chain Oracle,Financial Protocols,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$108000.00,$36000.00,144959.28,6/24/2025,Build,"LiquidsFi is a decentralized, secure liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity and on-chain data between multiple EVM chains and Soroban. It provides the Soroban ecosystem with a reliable way to bridge crypto assets from various EVM chains.","LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity across siloed blockchains. It is powered by a decentralized oracle relay network infrastructure and focuses on bridging assets securely and cost-effectively between EVM-compatible chains and Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem.

Interoperability has long been a challenge in blockchain development. Many existing solutions prioritize asset transfers between isolated chains, often introducing a single point of failure. While oracle-based inter-chain messaging protocols like Chainlink help relay data across chains, they primarily support EVM-based blockchains, leaving non-EVM ecosystems like Soroban without robust interoperability options.

LiquidsFi addresses this gap by developing a secure and efficient EVM-Soroban interoperability data transmission oracle network and asset bridge.

By enabling seamless liquidity transfers between EVM chains and Soroban, LiquidsFi enhances capital efficiency, dApp accessibility, and overall adoption of Soroban-based assets. Users who previously relied on EVM networks for interoperability can now securely transfer assets and access DeFi opportunities on Soroban, ultimately driving higher on-chain activity and TVL growth.

At the heart of LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and non-custodial bridge, which relies on active liquidity provision. To bootstrap liquidity and reward early users, LiquidsFi will launch a liquidity mining rewards program. This initiative will:

-   Attract early adopters by providing yield opportunities on idle stablecoins and other assets
    
-   Boost available liquidity for seamless cross-chain asset bridging
    
-   Foster long-term engagement by rewarding consistent participation
    

#### 2. Point-Based Token Rewards

LiquidsFi will implement a point-based token reward system, similar to a loyalty or cashback program. Users earn points (redeemable for tokens) when bridging assets through the protocol. This system is designed to:

-   Incentivize repeat usage of the bridge
    
-   Improve user retention through ongoing rewards
    
-   Encourage organic growth as users are rewarded for continued activity
    

#### 3. Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem Integration

To accelerate adoption, LiquidsFi will form strategic partnerships within the Soroban and Stellar ecosystems. These efforts include:

-   Integrations with Soroban-based dApps and DeFi platforms to expand use cases
    
-   Cross-marketing collaborations with ecosystem projects to leverage community overlap
    
-   Active participation in Soroban and Stellar growth initiatives and hackathons
    

#### 4. Community Engagement & Incentivized Programs

LiquidsFi will prioritize community-driven growth by launching targeted engagement campaigns, including:

-   Bounty Programs: Security and community bounties to encourage contributions and feedback
    
-   Marketing Collaborations: Partnering with KOLs, crypto influencers, and media outlets to amplify visibility
    
-   Education & Awareness Campaigns: Hosting AMAs, producing educational content, and organizing onboarding workshops to grow the user base
    

By combining liquidity incentives, token-based rewards, strategic partnerships, and community engagement, LiquidsFi is positioned to achieve rapid adoption, deep protocol liquidity, and strong developer and user traction from the outset. This multi-pronged strategy ensures both immediate impact and long-term sustainability.","LiquidsFi has been in development for several months, with the team conducting rigorous internal testing and multiple iterations of the MVP. The testing phase involved 15 internal users focused on identifying and resolving bugs, helping ensure a stable and secure foundation for the protocol.

During the testnet phase, LiquidsFi secured over $15,000 in TVL from stablecoin deposits — an early indicator of user trust and protocol engagement. The MVP (Beta) is expected to go live soon, with initial access planned for over 100 users. This beta release will serve as a crucial step toward refining the protocol ahead of the full mainnet launch.

This cross-chain breadth demonstrates our capacity to develop scalable, innovative, and impactful products that capitalize on each ecosystem’s strengths, with particular expertise in interoperability and multi-token management.

A recent survey in October 2024 involving 87 developers, blockchain professionals, and businesses from the USA, France, Luxembourg, and Turkey revealed that 75% faced challenges integrating non-Stellar tokens and 80% sought a more straightforward method for multi-token management and cross-chain transactions. These insights confirm the growing need for the MUWP-Stellar Multi-Token Cross-Chain SDK.

Our existing MUWP DApp already runs on the Stellar mainnet, having garnered more than 2,100 page views in the past year and recording 37 swaps in November alone, underscoring early traction and user interest. Beyond Stellar, MUWP integrates 59 DEXs and 44 bridges, making cross-chain swaps more affordable and efficient for diverse blockchain users. This network of connections positions MUWP as a one-stop platform for streamlined transfers and enhanced liquidity.

Industry recognition further validates our approach. We were selected by 50 Partners, a French VC-led incubator offering high-level mentorship, and we also joined the Chainlink Build Program, which improves our infrastructure for decentralized oracles and cross-chain security. Within the Stellar ecosystem specifically, we have already incorporated Stellar’s DEX for optimizing liquidity flow, begun leveraging Soroban smart contracts for cross-chain transactions, and simplified token issuance and conversion for new Stellar projects.

Our successful deployments on Solana and Aptos highlight our technical depth and ability to adapt to unique blockchain architectures. On Solana, we integrated high-performance liquidity pools to accelerate transaction speeds for cross-chain swaps, and on Aptos we created custom tools and modular SDK components to streamline multi-token swaps in a parallel execution environment. These achievements underscore our commitment to crafting efficient, developer-friendly infrastructure that can likewise benefit the Stellar ecosystem.

By securing the SCF Build Award, we can enhance our SDK, reduce integration hurdles for developers, accelerate multi-token adoption on Stellar, and significantly expand cross-chain liquidity entering the network.

Reyts - Stablecoin-Powered P2P Fiat DEX,SCF #35,Building a P2P Fiat DEX on Stellar,Reyts - Stablecoin-Powered P2P Fiat DEX,Applications,,Awarded,67,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$75000.00,$50000.00,138638.31,,Build,Developing a Stellar-based P2P fiat DEX to remove accessibility barriers for underserved currencies and offer best-in-market fees.,"🔄 Enhanced Currency Swaps

Reyts will use Stellar’s Path Payment Strict Send to automatically complete currency swaps when no peer match is found within a set time window (e.g., 30 minutes). This ensures users can still exchange at their chosen rate using Stellar's built-in liquidity.

Stellar in action:  
A user places a CAD→NGN swap. If no match is found, Reyts routes the transaction through Stellar’s decentralized exchange using Path Payment, fulfilling the swap at the requested rate with available liquidity.

A Soroban smart contract will monitor pending swap listings, and if a listing goes unmatched for a set period (e.g., 30 minutes), it triggers the fallback logic. The contract checks price conditions, validates rate limits, and initiates the Path Payment if criteria are met — all without human intervention.

Impact:  
This reduces wait times from hours to minutes, giving users a more reliable, seamless swap experience without changing how they use the app.

-  

💧 Decentralized Liquidity Pools

Reyts will leverage Soroban smart contracts to introduce automated liquidity pools, allowing vetted liquidity providers to contribute CAD and NGNC for swaps. These pools will follow AMM logic, automatically determining prices and executing trades.

Stellar in action:  
When a user initiates a swap, the system checks for peer matches. If none exist, it draws from Soroban-powered liquidity pools. Liquidity providers earn fees from every transaction they help fulfill.

Impact:  
More liquidity means fewer failed swaps, faster transactions, and greater user confidence — especially for less common exchange pairs like CAD↔NGN.

-  

✅ Compliance Automation

Reyts already enforces strict KYC/AML checks off-chain. As users begin to interact more directly with wallets, Stellar’s built-in compliance tools and Soroban will help enforce rules on-chain.

Stellar in action:  
Soroban smart contracts can restrict access to Reyts-issued assets unless a wallet meets verified compliance conditions (e.g., KYC flags or allowlists).

Impact:  
This ensures that even as Reyts moves toward decentralization, it remains fully compliant — with less manual overhead and more automation, supporting growth into new regulated markets.",https://shimmer-process-0ba.notion.site/Reyts-Stellar-Block-Chain-Upgrades-Technical-Architecture-1c79b7253112800ea2cfc5401d5ec683,"1.

----------------

Traditional centralized exchanges often come with lack of user control over assets, high fees, and limited access to multi-chain trading. Centralized exchanges can be vulnerable to security breaches, while fiat-to-crypto conversions remain difficult due to local country regulations and operability.

However, DEXs also have challenges, such as complex bridging processes, lack of in-app fiat on/off-ramps, and incapability for high-frequency trading.Many DEXs rely solely on AMM swaps, limiting trading strategies and often leading to high slippage and poor price execution.

#### Stellar’s Untapped Potential:

-   SDEX’s orderbook model enables high-frequency, low-fee trading, but lacks:
    
    -   Multi-chain asset access (e.g., ETH, SOL → XLM).
        
    -   Seamless fiat integration (despite Stellar’s anchor network).

Description: SwiftEx will enable users to seamlessly bridge, swap, and trade assets in a single streamlined process. Users can input all necessary details upfront (Amount, tolerance and Asset details), and the system will handle multi-step operations like bridging and trading (via SDEX) through a backend proxy server. Once one step completes, signed transactions will automatically execute the next step on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

Additionally, users will have the ability to bridge Stellar assets back to their multi-chain wallets effortlessly. This process may involve automated multi-step swaps (e.g., converting Stellar assets into USDT via SDEX before bridging to another blockchain) to simplify complex workflows.

Example Use Case: A user imports ETH or BNB from their multi-chain wallet, swaps it for BTC on SDEX, and receives BTC in their wallet—all in one operation. Demo : - https://vimeo.com/1075076753?share=copy

","To keep up-to-date on Stellar ecosystem news and developments, you'd have to follow websites and social accounts for numerous outlets such as Coindesk, The Block, Blockworks, Cointelegraph, Ledger Insights, CNBC, and Forbes, just to name a few. You'd also need to follow official blogs and social channels from existing ecosystem participants such as Cheesecake Labs and Soroban Domains, and everything in between. And video? Hopefully, you're an avid user of various video platforms because you'll also need to subscribe to updates from platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Adding to this complexity, navigating SDF-specific sources adds another layer of difficulty, requiring a meticulous approach to stay informed about Stellar's protocol updates and announcements through the official Stellar website, SDF blog entries, Developer Discord, and official social media channels like StellarOrg and BuildOnStellar. Additionally, tracking progress and updates for the incredibly diverse ecosystem projects presents a unique challenge. From official blogs to GitHub repositories and Twitter announcements, it is incredibly hard to see who is actively building on Stellar and where to find more information about them. Being unable to efficiently find and view this information leads to the perception of lack of innovation on the network. This fragmentation not only makes it challenging to stay informed but also creates barriers to entry for those new to Stellar. Vital events and discussions are often missed due to the lack of centralized notifications and the diverse rules of engagement across platforms.

  

Experience the convenience of navigating the Stellar network's dynamic landscape through one centralized web hub - Lumen Loop. Lumen Loop is designed to streamline the Stellar blockchain network's vast information ecosystem into an organized, accessible format. Lumen Loop automatically scrapes the web for the latest Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and developments. The scraper then uses AI to categorize and tag the content, as well as provide shortened, or ""TLDR"", excerpts for searchability and ease of access. For example, want to see just educational content? We’ve got you covered! Looking for protocol updates? No problem! We’ve got a category for that! Spanish content? Check! Lumen Loop also includes a project tracker where each Stellar project has a detail page with summaries, development activity, social metrics and news, making it easy for the community to follow developments. Let’s say you are a SCF reviewer or voter and you want to know if a project has been active in the ecosystem. Head to the project page, and we’ll have a breakdown on their social and dev activity! Lumen Loop’s project tracker increases project transparency and accountability. Beyond news discovery, Lumen Loop offers a centralized events calendar that details Stellar-related live events, meetups, and conferences from a variety of sources with essential information for easy community participation. Subscribe to our calendar and you won’t miss out! This ecosystem-wide calendar will keep people informed and boost engagement within the ecosystem. Finally, once Lumen Loop finds new information about projects or a new event it automatically posts summaries to various communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit and X/Twitter. This helps promote projects and grow the ecosystem - by keeping everyone in the loop.

  

We create scrape rules to monitor Stellar project activity on different platforms. We normalize the discovered data from an enormous list of sources into one database. We use AI to give tags and categorize. This includes a manual review process. We push discovered content to our web platform where it's easily browsed by category, tag, project, etc. and also update the events page and the individual project tracker pages if applicable. We automatically push summaries of the discovered content to different social platforms.

  

The basic idea of Lumen Loop is as follows: Centralized Information Hub: Aggregates Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and project developments into one platform. AI-Categorized Streams: Uses AI to organize content into searchable streams, such as educational content or developer updates, or even SCF project news. Comprehensive Event Calendar: Offers a centralized calendar detailing Stellar-related events for easy community participation. Detailed Project Tracker: Features individual pages for Stellar projects with summaries, development activity, social metrics, and a project news feed. Automated Social Media Sharing: Promotes ecosystem projects and updates by automatically posting discovered content to platforms like Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Enhances Ecosystem Transparency: Increases project transparency and accountability through detailed activity breakdowns. Community Growth and Engagement: Aims to support community growth and project visibility within the Stellar ecosystem.

KindFi,SCF #35,Social Impact Crowdfunding,KindFi,Applications,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$79998.00,$26666.00,88676.06,5/22/2025,Build,Crowdfunding platform connecting donors with verified LATAM causes via milestone-based fund releases to prevent misuse of funds,"1.  Milestone-Based Fund Release Model: KindFi uses a milestone-based fund release model inspired by SCF, where each project receives funds in 2–3 tranches. Funds are held in smart contract escrows and only released when specific, verifiable milestones such as impact evidence, photos, or reports are met. Approval requires consensus from 3 of 4 platform admins. If milestones are not met, the smart contract automatically blocks further releases. In case of non-reimbursable donations, unused funds are redirected to a community fund; otherwise, they are returned to the donor.
    
1.  KYC & Passkey-Based Authentication: KindFi integrates an advanced user authentication system built on the Stellar Passkey Kit, enhanced for seamless onboarding and security. Users can register and sign in using biometric passkey eliminating passwords while ensuring strong, Web3-native identity verification. In parallel, our AI-assisted KYC flow ensures fast, compliant, and secure verification. Identity checks are optimized to prevent duplication and fraud, with on-chain attestations recorded through Soroban smart contracts for transparency and traceability.
    
1.  Community Fund & Governance: Once a year, locked funds from failed projects are redistributed through a community voting process powered by Soroban. Only users holding a Kinders NFT—earned through meaningful contributions—can vote to decide which eligible projects will receive the funds. This mechanism reinforces transparent, community-driven governance and gives real utility to the reputation-based NFTs
    
1.  Kinders NFT as Governance Key: The Kinders NFT, built on Soroban, serves as a dynamic governance and participation tool. It evolves visually and functionally based on each user's on-chain reputation and activity. As users contribute to causes, their Kinders NFT gains reputation points, unlocking greater decision-making power in community votes. This incentivizes continued engagement while reinforcing trust and transparency in the ecosystem.
    
1.  Reputation & Tiered Voting System: KindFi introduces evolving Kinders NFTs with progressive tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond—based on each user’s on-chain reputation. Higher tiers grant more voting power (1 to 10 votes per round), early access to campaigns, and exclusive rewards. Reputation grows through impact-driven actions like donation streaks, referrals, category diversity, completing quests, and successfully supporting projects. All actions and NFT progression are tracked and powered by Soroban smart contracts.
    
1.  On-Chain Referral Program: KindFi’s referral program lets users invite others to join and support causes using a unique referral code. When a referred user completes KYC and donates, both parties earn on-chain rewards powered by Soroban smart contracts. Rewards include reputation points and visual upgrades to their Kinders NFT. Soroban automates referral tracking, reputation updates, and tiered rewards, unlocking higher benefits as users grow their referral impact.
    
1.  Streak System: KindFi’s streak system rewards consistent donor activity through Soroban smart contracts. Streaks are built by donating frequently, in volume, or across diverse causes. Active streaks enhance a user’s Kinders NFT with dynamic visual effects and unlock benefits like increased voting power, reputation growth, early campaign access, and exclusive badges. Soroban tracks activity and enforces a grace period; if the streak is broken, progress resets automatically.
    
1.  Visibility & Recognition System: KindFi highlights top donors, projects, and organizations to foster community prestige and sustained engagement. Using Soroban smart contracts, the platform tracks real-time metrics like donation volume, campaign diversity, milestone success, and NFT level. Rankings dynamically update on-chain, powering the ""Feature Kinder"" section with titles like ""Top Donor"" or ""Best Regional Contributor."" Highlighted users and projects earn exclusive NFTs, increased voting power, early access, and visual platform badges. High-impact projects are automatically promoted, AI-recommended to new donors, and prioritized for matching fund campaigns, all managed transparently via Soroban contracts.
    
1.  On-Chain Community Rankings & Rewards: KindFi’s community ranking system incentivizes sustained participation through automated, transparent rewards. Soroban smart contracts manage real-time leaderboards and prize distribution based on user reputation and platform activity.
    
1.  Dynamic Contribution Challenges System: KindFi’s Quest System introduces gamified challenges that motivate users to donate consistently and across diverse campaigns. Quests encourage actions like supporting new categories, maintaining streaks, or completing non-refundable donations. This system promotes ongoing engagement, fuels user reputation growth, and sustains the flow of funds to the Impact and Community Funds, creating a more interconnected and resilient ecosystem.
    
1.  Matching Funds (Impact Fund & Community Fund): KindFi amplifies individual donations through a matching model powered by two key sources: the Impact Fund (fed by success fees and direct donations) and the Community Fund (filled with unused funds from failed campaigns, redistributed via annual community vote). Soroban smart contracts and AI assess project history and projected impact to assign dynamic matching levels: Basic: +20% Intermediate: +50% Premium: +100%
    
    This model incentivizes early contributions, enhances campaign momentum, and recycles unused funds to boost ecosystem resilience. Matching funds are fueled by retained campaign balances, fractional success fees (0.3–1%), quest completions, direct donations, and external sponsors seeking platform visibility.  
    

This is our next-generation crowdfunding platform leveraging Soroban smart contracts, Stellar infrastructure, and AI to create a secure, transparent ecosystem building a global movement of trust, transparency, and lasting impact",https://www.notion.so/KindFi-Architecture-Version-1-1-1d18754a4a4b8011b374dd993e370064,"Success for KindFi means reshaping how social impact is funded by proving that our stellar based milestone, transparent crowdfunding can outperform traditional models and unlock real trust at scale. Post-mainnet, our core success targets include:

-   50+ verified social impact projects launched across LATAM
    
-   3,000+ unique contributors onboarded through passkey + KYC flow
    
-   $250K+ in tracked donations processed via Stellar Network
    
-   At least 1 community-led governance cycles completed using NFT-based voting  
    

But metrics alone aren’t enough. True success means:  

-   NGOs and grassroots causes choosing KindFi over legacy platforms because they trust our blockchain milestone and escrow base model
    
-   Contributors returning not just to donate, but to participate in governance, complete quests, and grow their Kinders reputation NFTs
    
-   Developers and creators using KindFi not just as a product, but as a platform they can contribute to, and evolve  
    

We will know we’ve succeeded when a campaign’s credibility is defined not by who runs it, but by how it runs openly, transparently, and on-chain.  

Ultimately, KindFi aims to prove that blockchain isn’t just viable for real-world impact, it’s superior. Success is not just launch. It’s adoption, accountability, and communities becoming their own stewards of change",https://www.kindfi.org/,https://github.com/kindfi-org/kindfi,https://youtu.be/Hlh4R8u-lWU,Yes,"Our go-to-market strategy is grounded in real-world need, regional expertise, and a community-first approach, designed to scale KindFi from a LATAM-based pilot into a global, trust-driven crowdfunding platform. We are launching initially in Costa Rica, where our team is based and where we have already engaged local foundations and NGOs for early campaign onboarding. From there, we will expand across key LATAM regions where Stellar already has ambassador programs (e.g., Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Chile), aiming to co-create with those communities, identify trusted local projects, and onboard regional ambassadors into KindFi’s ecosystem. Our goal is to establish KindFi nodes in multiple countries, creating a real grassroots movement around verifiable social impact on Stellar.  

As LATAM founders, we understand firsthand the systemic challenges in our region access to funds, transparency gaps, and donor mistrust. That’s why we prioritize partnering with other LATAM-based projects, builders, and communities, because no one understands the region’s needs better than those who live them. KindFi is not designed in abstraction; it’s built in context.

  
We will strengthen go-to-market through partnerships with other Stellar-based solutions like Meru, Palta Labs Team, and other ecosystem tools that support onboarding, identity, and create impact. Together, we create a more unified experience for users entering Web3 for the first time without needing to understand its complexity at once.

  
On the marketing and PR front, we will:  

-   Launch public demo sessions featuring verified campaigns and live on-chain milestone releases
    
-   Publish impact stories of early KindFi projects through newsletters, social channels, and ecosystem blogs
    
-   Engage Web3 and social impact podcasts, LATAM blockchain communities, and Stellar’s own media channels
    
-   Engage alternative media and podcasters as ""No pasa nada"" and ""Delfino"" (Costa Rican Alternative News Source) to introduce the new way of changing things in LATAM using Stellar and KindFi together.
    
-   Build a contributor reward system that can be uses through the Only Dust program, incentivizing open-source participation, user-generated content, and social sharing enhanced with KindFi’s NFT badges and on-chain contributor recognition.
    
-   Participate in key regional events and hackathons to activate both developers and cause creators  
    

Digital marketing will focus on multilingual content (ES, EN, PT) across platforms like Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Instagram—anchored by a strong visual identity and messaging centered on “trustless transparency” and “real-world change powered by crypto and Stellar, the only blockchain truly impacting real-world causes.""  

Ultimately, KindFi’s adoption strategy is not just about reach it’s about depth. We are building a long-term presence in each region we serve, with local validators, community members, and project owners acting as stewards of impact. Our platform grows through trust, transparency, and local relevance not just paid promotion and dreams.","-   Pitched to Key Stakeholders: Successfully presented KindFi to representatives from USAID and other government programs, generating strong interest in its ability to ensure transparency and accountability in funding, as well as its potential to bring on-chain accountability to processes that are often handled off-chain.
    
-   NGO and Foundation Outreach: Initiated discussions with foundations and NGOs in Costa Rica to understand their funding challenges and demonstrate how KindFi’s blockchain-powered solution can effectively address these pain points
    
-   Developer Community Engagement: KindFi is connected to a global network of over 6,000 Web3 developers, actively raising awareness and visibility for the platform. Our current developer-focused channel includes more than 141 members from Argentina, Costa Rica, India, Nigeria, Colombia, and Chile.
    
-   LATAM Community Engagement: KindFi is deeply integrated with the Dojo Coding community, which brings together over 186 Web3 developers from across Latin America who are actively contributing to the platform’s growth and innovation.
    
-   Partnership: We have successfully established partnerships with several organizations working with highly vulnerable communities in the region, particularly in Costa Rica. One example is ACJ-YMCA, an organization present in over 170 countries and reaching more than 68 million people worldwide. Their mission to bring social justice and peace to youth and their communities will be supported through donation campaigns on KindFi once we go live on mainnet
    
-   Partnership: We have also formalized a partnership with the project and foundation Asociación Deportiva E.G Goicoechea to relaunch their efforts through fundraising campaigns on KindFi. This initiative began on March 5, 2011, in Costa Rica in collaboration with the international ISSOP foundation, under the name Escuela de Fútbol Holanda Purral. The project was designed to use sports as a way to reach vulnerable children and youth, offering them holistic development, improved living conditions, education in various non-sport areas, essential tools, and even access to meals. It successfully operated for 12 years and was sponsored by the Instituto Costarricense del Deporte y la Recreación, having supported over 1,500 children in extreme need. Unfortunately, the lack of funding led to its closure on March 3, 2023. Today, many of the children who were once uplifted through sports are left without hope or support.
    
-   Partnership: We have also secured agreements with animal rescue organizations in the region, including Auxilio Animal Cartago, SOS Rescates Felinos, Fundación Tierra de Animales, and Casas Cuna Puntarenas. These organizations operate in areas with significant needs, and their initiatives will be featured under the Animal Rescue category on KindFi once we launch on mainnet.

Budget: $45,000 in XLM  

Brief description:  
The MVP represents the foundation of KindFi’s platform establishing a secure, decentralized, and transparent crowdfunding flow that validates both user and project authenticity from the first interaction. This phase includes the deployment of our end-to-end authentication and identity verification system, campaign creation interface, escrow-based fund custody, and contribution flows tied to milestone releases.  

Our architecture leverages the Stellar blockchain to handle secure fund management, real-time indexing, and on-chain verification of campaign data. Contributors can register, verify their identity through an AI-assisted KYC process that complies with SEP-0012, and securely log in using device-native Passkey authentication (biometric WebAuthn). This guarantees phishing-resistant access and links every user to a verified Stellar address through Soroban smart contracts.  

Project creators (Kindlers) will be able to create a campaign with clearly defined milestones. These milestones are recorded on-chain, and donations are held in escrow until completion is verified. An internal reviewer dashboard will allow milestone approvals to trigger on-chain releases of funds. While AI will eventually support verification flows, human administrators will validate them manually at this stage, with auditability ensured via SubQuery-based ledger indexing.  

The MVP also includes:

-   Initial onboarding integration using test mode to simulate real-world access
    
-   A multilingual frontend experience built with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui
    
-   Contributor and project creator dashboards for basic account and project management
    
-   Early implementation of NFT-based contributor identity and badge placeholders (non-dynamic at this stage)  
    

All smart contracts deployed in this phase (authentication and escrow) will operate on Stellar testnet, and all user flows will be fully testable with dev data and mock user verification.  

How to measure completion:  

-   Fully working flow from Passkey-based registration to first testnet donation
    
-   Admin dashboard triggers milestone-based fund release logic on testnet
    
-   SEP-0012-compatible KYC verification pipeline functional and connected to blockchain addresses
    
-   Campaigns are stored with milestone definitions and locked under escrow
    
-   Users can simulate donations using testnet wallets
    
-   Project creation, updates, basic search, and language toggle implemented in frontend  
    

This MVP unlocks not only our internal dogfooding and testing, but also external testing by contributors and community reviewers, who will be invited to audit and validate the core infrastructure","Estimated completion: November 2025  
Budget: $0 (Access to Stellar LaunchKit for audits and infra support)  

Brief description:  
The Testnet milestone focuses on expanding core functionality into a fully feature-complete product, operating on Stellar testnet and integrating Soroban-based smart contracts, gamification layers, and advanced contribution logic. This phase introduces the first version of our dynamic NFT-based reputation system, milestone automation, and AI-assisted moderation and onboarding tools. All flows will be testable end-to-end and structured for external audit and simulation.  

Key developments during this phase include:  
  
Dynamic NFT Reputation System (Kinders)

The Kinders NFT system, deployed on Soroban, evolves based on user impact. During Testnet, contributors will begin earning NFTs that grow in visual complexity and functionality based on their behavior (e.g., donation frequency, diversity of causes, completed quests, and referral performance). NFTs will be tied on-chain to each user’s account and updated via Soroban logic and contribution triggers. We will implement four progressive NFT tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond), each conferring a different number of governance votes and early-access privileges. This system establishes the basis for future DAO-style community engagement and voting on fund redistribution  
  
AI-Powered Project Review & KYC Enhancement

We will introduce our first live implementation of KindFi's AI layer, focused on assisting in:

-   Project legitimacy checks using Multimodal RAG for evaluating images, documents, and impact descriptions
    
-   AI moderation agents that detect fraudulent campaign signals or inconsistencies
    
-   Enhanced KYC confidence scoring and auto-flagging of suspicious submissions
    
-   An AI assistant that helps project creators write better campaign narratives, verify milestone documentation, and simulate expected impact
    

While human validation remains critical, AI tooling will accelerate throughput, help prioritize reviews, and maintain consistent standards  
  
Quest, Streak, and Referral Systems

We will deploy the first logic for KindFi’s gamified contributor experience, including:

-   Quest Engine: Smart contract and UI for goal-based participation (e.g., support a campaign in 3 different regions; donate 3 weeks in a row)
    
-   Streak Tracker: Reputation boost for consistent behavior over time (e.g., weekly/monthly donation consistency)
    
-   Referral Engine: On-chain Soroban logic to track referred users, update Kinders NFTs, and issue rewards automatically for verified onboarding and donation activity
    

This phase builds the incentive structures that transform passive donations into long-term, identity-linked participation  
  
Community Fund Governance (Simulation)

The Testnet phase will also include a simulated governance flow to redistribute unused or retained funds from unfulfilled campaigns. KindFi will introduce:

-   A voting UI accessible to Kinders with valid NFTs
    
-   Vote weighting by NFT tier (e.g., Bronze = 1 vote, Diamond = 10 votes)
    
-   Smart contract logic to simulate redistribution scenarios and visualize impact
    
-   Community fund balance tracker (read from escrow contract logs)
    

This lays the groundwork for decentralized platform governance and collective decision-making around resource allocation.  
  
Other Key Deliverables

-   Escrow automation enhancements: Funds released automatically upon off-chain verification status and milestone signals
    
-   SubQuery indexing for donation history, referral trees, and NFT evolution
    
-   Event-driven notification system: Email/webhook-based milestone alerts, project updates, and vote calls
    

How to measure completion:

-   Dynamic NFT issuance and evolution functional on testnet
    
-   Smart contract-based referral tracking operational
    
-   AI moderation agents reviewing real project drafts
    
-   Simulated fund redistribution flow fully functional
    
-   Quest completion recorded and reflected in NFT metadata
    
-   All campaign types, user types, and contribution actions recorded on SubQuery and queryable from dashboard
    

  
This phase ends with a fully operational product on Stellar testnet, with all user types (donors, creators, admins) having access to a decentralized, data-driven, gamified environment for validating social causes.","Estimated completion: February 2026  
Budget: $35,000 in XLM  

Brief description:  
The Mainnet milestone marks the public launch of KindFi’s platform on the Stellar blockchain. By this phase, all Soroban smart contracts, identity systems, gamification logic, and governance tooling will be battle-tested and production-ready. The entire platform will transition from Stellar testnet to mainnet, with full end-to-end flows for donors, project creators, and governance participants activated in a live environment.  

This phase also represents the integration of transparency, security, and long-term engagement incentives into a cohesive experience designed for scale, enabling both grassroots organizations and global contributors to interact with complete confidence.  
  
Production Deployment of All Smart Contracts

All core contracts will be deployed to Stellar mainnet, including:

-   Escrow smart contract with milestone release logic
    
-   AuthController + AccountFactory for biometric passkey-based decentralized login
    
-   Kinders NFT logic with level-based voting power and reward tiering
    
-   Community fund and governance contract, supporting annual redistribution with on-chain voting
    
-   Quest and referral smart contracts to maintain reputation state and trigger NFT mutations  
    

All contracts will include upgrade safeguards, permission controls, and verification support  
  
Mainnet Project Onboarding

At least 7 real-world causes will be onboarded and funded in this phase. These will be verified nonprofits or grassroots initiatives that pass full KYC and milestone pre-validation. This will demonstrate:

-   Working fiat onramp (via OnRamper or Circle)
    
-   Real user donations flowing into mainnet escrow
    
-   Verified milestone completion triggering fund release
    
-   Publicly visible impact reporting, uploaded to IPFS or off-chain sources, and linked to on-chain proof  
    

Each project will also support project updates, multilingual descriptions, and post-completion feedback collection.  
  
AI Moderation & Recommendation System

AI agents will be expanded to include:

-   Project matching engine that recommends causes to users based on their past behavior, donation history, and region/category preferences
    
-   AI-assistants in the campaign creation flow to help Kindlers optimize content for funding success
    
-   Real-time fraud detection alerts and project scoring using multimodal AI inputs  
    

This AI layer will make platform operations more scalable, user-friendly, and transparent for both creators and contributors.  
  
Full Gamification & Impact Engine

The NFT-based reputation system will be fully activated, with Kinders NFTs now:

-   Visually evolving based on user behavior
    
-   Granting access to exclusive campaigns or private funding rounds
    
-   Unlocking advanced governance rights
    
-   Displayed as public identity and social proof across the platform  
    

Users will earn achievements for consistency, diversity, and social sharing, and can track their progress through a personal impact dashboard. Leaderboards and featured Kinders/Kindlers will be promoted based on on-chain metrics  
  
Community Governance Activation

-   The first community voting cycle for fund redistribution will take place
    
-   All verified Kinders with voting rights via their NFTs will be able to participate
    
-   Voting logic will be executed on-chain using the mainnet Community Fund contract
    
-   Redistribution logic will include options to support promising upcoming campaigns or reward top contributors with NFT-based incentives  
    

This cycle will set a precedent for transparent, decentralized governance powered by real user reputation and project impact.  
  
Platform-wide Readiness

-   All onboarding, KYC, and recovery flows will support mobile and desktop
    
-   Localization (ES, EN,) completed for user-facing content and onboarding
    
-   Legal disclaimers, T&C, and data protection policies audited for LATAM
    
-   Real-time indexer tracking donations, project milestones, referral trees, and NFT state.
    

How to measure completion:

-   All users interact with production-grade biometric Passkey login linked to blockchain
    
-   Kinders NFTs are minted and evolve based on live user actions
    
-   Campaigns are created, funded, and milestone-verified using real funds
    
-   Escrow logic performs correctly, with no premature release or contract errors
    
-   Community Fund executes first governance cycle, with verifiable voting and fund reallocation
    
-   On-chain and off-chain data are continuously indexed and exposed via dashboards
    
-   Feedback collected from early real-world users and featured projects

In the period leading up to the launch, we’ll be speaking with projects on Stellar that have their own token to discuss having them launch a Spinach competition for their tokens. 

  

In addition, we’d like to partner with SDF to incentivize liquidity orchestration by/for new projects participating in SCF rounds. This encourages new projects to optimize for growing TVL and liquidity, which is good for the entire ecosystem. Simultaneously this helps with funding for nascent projects that are gaining some traction.

  

With this three-pronged approach, we intend to establish Spinach as a default ecosystem growth tactic on Stellar.","The Glo Dollar team has been running an excel-based alpha v0.01 of Spinach in the Celo ecosystem and noticed it has been working well within the Glo Dollar context. Through distributing just $2k in builder grants per month we managed to orchestrate $66k in liquidity on Celo, activating 8 projects to participate who rallied over 150 community users to provide liquidity.

It ingests full classic and Soroban data via Galexie or Stellar RPC, overcoming Horizon's limitations, particularly for complex Soroban event access which is currently difficult for many builders. Developers define Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using our CLI or SDK to chain together stateless, reusable processors (microservices) that apply custom logic – like filtering, enrichment (e.g., with AI), or state calculations. Processed data streams reliably to databases, APIs, alerting systems, or even triggers Soroban contract calls. While core tooling like the CLI and processor templates will be available, developers will primarily deploy and operate these pipelines via a managed Obsrvr Flow platform, simplifying setup and maintenance.

Key features leveraging Stellar/Soroban:

-   Unified Ingestion: Direct access to raw classic ledger data and Soroban events/effects via Galexie or native Stellar RPC.
    
-   Programmable Processors: Build custom logic using reusable, Protobuf-enforced microservices reacting to Stellar operations or Soroban events. Chain, replay, and test processors independently.
    
-   Multi-Sink Routing: Stream processed data reliably to diverse destinations (Postgres, webhooks, Discord, triggering Soroban RPC calls).
    
-   Developer Tooling: CLI and Control Plane SDK (interfacing with the managed platform) for declarative pipeline management, schema registry, real-time observability, and retry queues.
    
-   Public Data Source: We will provide a publicly accessible, Galexie-powered data lake of Stellar ledger data (Mainnet/Testnet) via Google Cloud Storage (Requester Pays) to accelerate ecosystem development.
    

This unified infrastructure is vital for wallet/dApp builders (who currently often build custom indexers), analytics platforms, and custody solutions needing timely, granular, and programmable access to both classic and Soroban activity.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_7yjAfWR3asErRd7c-6U0sIQUiEnIjc/view?usp=sharing,"We will measure success through a combination of adoption, functionality, and ecosystem impact:

-   Adoption: 20+ distinct developer teams actively using the Flow CLI, SDK or processors in development or production environments by the end of Q1 2026.
    
-   Deployment: 10+ unique, custom pipelines deployed by external teams on the Flow platform, demonstrating real-world application.
    
-   Efficiency: Demonstrate measurable reduction (e.g., target >50% reduction in boilerplate code/development time) in building specific real-time automation tasks compared to traditional Horizon polling methods, showcased via at least 2 public case studies.
    
-   Value Proposition Validation: At least 3 distinct production use cases publicly highlighted (e.g., via blog posts, demos) demonstrating the value of unified classic and Soroban data streaming through Flow.

Stellar DeFi Dune Dashboards,SCF #35,Stellar DeFi Dune Dashboards,,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$25000.00,$8333.33,27711.95,5/22/2025,Build,Verifiable Dune dashboards to help Stellar community track real DeFi on-chain data with transparent smart contract queries.,"Check our video here!  
Problem we are solving:  
Currently, most DeFi stats on Stellar come from project-provided reports, which are not always transparent or easy to verify. Platforms like DeFi Llama and DappRadar often rely on these reports instead of pulling data directly from the blockchain.

On the other hand, there are many ecosystem stats very useful that can only be calculated using an external tool like Dune Dashboards, like Percentage of Swaps being aggregated, average slippage of swaps and more.  

How DeFi Dune Dashboards Solves this:  
The Stellar DeFi Dune Dashboards will change this by providing fully verifiable, on-chain data from smart contract activity from all DeFi protocols on the ecosystem. These dashboards will track important stats like Weekly and Monthly Active Users, Average Slippage on Trades, Volume Analisis, Percentage of Aggregated Trades, and Liquidity Provider Activity.

For AMMs and aggregators, we will show key insights, including trade volume, slippage, price impact, and how often trades go through aggregators instead of single AMMs. We will also track arbitrage profits and how many trades are related to arbitrage.

This project will make Stellar DeFi data more transparent and accessible for everyone, helping users, developers, and investors understand how healthy and active the ecosystem really is. We will also maintain and update the dashboards for one year to ensure they stay reliable.

  
Extra Comments:

It's important to understand that Dune dashboards need regular maintenance. Over time, some queries can become too large because they are analyzing more and more data. When this happens, we need to export the results into Materialized Views to keep the dashboards fast and reliable.

Most importantly, this submission includes the ongoing maintenance of all queries and dashboards, so they stay up-to-date and useful over time.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fr9qA5cXs-AAwlur5zNvQgsRGw8-FVw21qy-6UyaN6w/edit?usp=sharing,"​At least 10 new stars every month on our Dashboards

    -   No changes to guest booking flows—Stellar transactions are embedded into the existing checkout and POS process.
        
    -   The guest wallet functionality allows direct top-ups and payments, ensuring full usability across hospitality services.

    -   Integrated financial reports will provide businesses with real-time insights into Stellar-based transactions.
        
    -   Businesses can filter transactions by payment method, enabling seamless financial tracking.

Industry Positioning & Scaling

-   Hospitality-Centric Focus: Unlike generic crypto payment solutions, Logistech's integration is tailor-made for tourism businesses, ensuring industry-specific functionality.
    
-   No Additional Hardware or Training Required: Businesses can process Stellar transactions immediately, with no additional onboarding burden.
    
-   Scalability Without External Marketing: Adoption is entirely organic within Logistech’s existing user base, meaning expansion happens naturally as new hospitality businesses join the platform.
    

By embedding Stellar transactions directly into tourism industry operations, Logistech will ensure practical, scalable adoption of blockchain payments without relying on external marketing efforts.","Logistech has firmly established itself as a market leader in Vietnam’s hospitality sector, demonstrating strong product-market fit through widespread adoption:  

-   700k+ guests managed across hostels, hotels, and cruises.  
    
-   $30M+ in transactional volume processed through our POS and management systems.  
    
-   Seamless NFC-based payments via guest wristbands and wearables.  
      
    

Currently, guests settle their bills at check-out using traditional payment methods, which often come with high transaction fees, particularly for international travelers. Stellar integration via Beans Wallet will provide a low-cost, real-time, and borderless alternative, directly reducing these costs.  

Why Stellar?

-   Lower Fees – Guests will experience significantly lower transaction costs compared to credit cards and bank transfers.
    
-   Frictionless Adoption – Since guests already use RFID wristbands for purchases, they can simply fund their Stellar wallet before check-out with minimal effort.
    
-   Enhanced Accessibility – Payments can be made instantly via QR code, with businesses receiving USDC for financial stability.  
    

This first-of-its-kind integration will extend crypto-powered check-outs to the hospitality industry, making transactions more affordable, efficient, and accessible for global travelers.","Tranche 1 - MVP: Core Beans Wallet Integration & POS Payment Flow

Loto Punto is a kiosk for payments and payouts. It works as a gateway for 12 thousand financial services in banking, utility bills, cell phone top ups and digital wallets. Our system is integrated with Digital Identity and Open Banking services using AI, automating physical payments with high standards of security and fraud prevention.

How Loto Punto works with Stellar

Loto Punto kiosks enable easy and affordable self-service transactions in local currency within seconds, providing a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to pay, send and receive money. By integrating Stellar Blockchain with Loto Punto’s micro- service-oriented architecture system, we'll offer a more convenient an inexpensive channel for cross border remittances. This is achieved by converting physical FIAT currency into stable cryptocurrency and vice versa, partnering with relevant Stellar Wallets that provide on-ramp and off-ramp services in each LATAM country. For this matter, we have already an alliance with ""Meru Wallet"", that is integrated with Moneygram.

In the scope of this current project, we'll leverage our existing capabilities, installed capacity and knowledge of cryptoassets transactions, to On-Ramp fiat to crypto in the Stellar network, enabling fund transfers to Stellar accounts of end users. This new functionality will allow end users (senders) to make cost-effective remittances by converting FIAT currency deposited at Loto Punto kiosks into crypto accounts on the Stellar Network. Recipients can redeem their stablecoin digitally or at chosen Stellar anchor physical locations.

Benefits

Loto Punto offers a streamlined approach to financial services. Our kiosks are installed totally free in various points of sale with loyal customers such as convenient stores, drugstores and gas stations. Unlike traditional payment networks that rely on human agents, Loto Punto operates as an automated version, resulting in 50% lower operating costs. By eliminating the need for human sales agents and fixed space leasing costs,Loto Punto efficiently serves up to 40 locations with just one employee. This not only relieves point-of-sale staff from cash management operations and customer service but also provides a clear cost advantage over competitors that require a human interface for end-user transactions

In aggregate, by integrating Stellar and its Anchors, Loto Punto will serve as a convenient one-stop shop for unbanked users in LATAM.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCRirz5y-8kHuuz6pSeTezdWgHEC-_0N/view?usp=sharing,"The successful installation and integration of three Loto Punto kiosks in independent local drugstores will result in key outputs, including seamless functionality of self-service remittance transactions, high customer satisfaction, and increased usage by an aproximate of 2500 venezuelan migrants. These outputs will have significant impacts, such as providing unbanked individuals with easy access to low-cost remittance services, boosting the financial inclusion of Venezuelan migrants and enhancing the overall customer experience in the drugstores. Additionally, the project will demonstrate the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Loto Punto kiosks, potentially driving further adoption and scalability in additional locations.

For Stellar Corporation, this initiative will showcase the practical application of Stellar Blockchain technology in real-world financial services, increasing brand recognition and fostering trust in its blockchain solutions. The project will also expand Stellar’s user base and transactional volume in LATAM, contributing to the broader adoption of Stellar’s ecosystem.",https://www.lotopunto.co/servicios/giros-internacionales,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1iq6N7k-FwGWK-RxhYVRBQed41810hTrBGoF8OZoSU/edit?usp=sharing,https://youtu.be/Z2M5QiIJE78,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Go-To-Market Plan for the Remittance Service in Loto Punto Kiosks

·        Expansion Plan: Develop a plan for scaling the deployment of Loto Punto kiosks to additional locations based on the pilot program’s results and customer demand. With each kiosk making $65 daily, our annual revenue will hit $132 million at scale in a network of 5500 Loto Puntos.","In terms of traction, Loto Punto has a achieved a user base, exponential growth and commercial adoption with its current portfolio of financial services. We achieved Product Market Fit with our first kiosk operating. Sales reached an average of COP $20 million per month at 40% exponential growth, acquiring 2,000 paid users by word of mouth and a waitlist of 30 businesses that want Loto Punto. Our validation confirmed that the unbanked in Latin America are willing to pay for convenient access to cash and digital money services.

On blockchain development, we secured a pilot contract with Bogotá District for a Binance-based remittance pilot (see demo at: https://youtu.be/89WppjlWJi4).  Additionally, we hold long-term contracts with transaction aggregators, partnering with Colombia's top five banks: Banco de Bogotá, Banco Popular, Banco de Occidente, Banco Davivienda, and Banco AV Villas.

Loto Punto's ongoing development of the remittance service on the Stellar network includes key milestones such as:

-   Validation of Stellar accounts via QR code through the Horizon API
    
-   Local currency to stablecoin quote conversion in real time
    
-   Functionality to send PAYMENTS within Stellar accounts through the Horizon API (testnet)
    
-   Document and face recognition with AI, using the camera peripherals of the kiosks.

-   Product: A comprehensive dashboard offering multi-currency management (community tokens + stablecoins), real-time analytics, automated invoicing powered by Soroban, and integrated compliance tools.
    
-   Unique Advantage: Soroban smart contracts streamline complex workflows—such as conditional disbursements and expiration dates—that traditional systems struggle to manage.
    

Beneficiaries

-   Service: Gain flexible access to funds via community currencies and stablecoins, allowing for local purchases as well as broader financial needs like paying utility bills or facilitating cross-border remittances.
    
-   Product: A mobile app (available on iOS and Android) featuring offline functionality, and a built-in marketplace connecting beneficiaries with local merchants.

During this pilot, over 4,500 transactions were completed, enabling the purchase of fresh food worth $23,000 USD from local merchants, which directly supported underprivileged families and revitalized the local economy.

In recognition of this success, Comunitaria has earned prestigious accolades, including the UNICEF “Disruptive Social Impact Projects” Award, Blockchain for Humanity Winner, innovation grants from Blockis.eu, NGI Ledger, and BlockStart, European Climate Action’s “Clean Cities” Recognition, and the Spanish Government’s “Break the Poverty Circle” Award.

Beyond this proof of concept, we have garnered critical endorsements and commitments that underscore our readiness for broader deployment. Endorsement letters from UNICEF and other respected organizations are available for review (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-38ZHD5ZH8d36zYf-G1j2BFFuE7JuoXx/view?usp=sharing), and an endorsement video from our strategic partner, Caritas Internationalis—a global network operating in over 162 countries—further validates our model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vps7D4T9EGLHuxjV2NZLWVsOGNd7Wcdm/view?usp=sharing). Caritas is actively engaging with us to scale the initiative, and we have initiated discussions with additional municipalities and NGOs to launch new pilot programs in San Cristóbal, Madrid, and other underprivileged neighborhoods.

We have discontinued the use of Fuse due to its PoS model favoring larger stakeholders and have fully migrated to Stellar—whose trusted nodes offer a fairer, more robust, and production-ready platform. In addition, we plan to integrate the Stellar Disbursement Platform to facilitate stablecoin transactions, enabling enhanced cross-border disbursements, rapid disaster response, and improved liquidity.

Flashback,SCF #34 ,Decentralized Multi-Cloud Storage,Flashback,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,33,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$120000.00,$82350.00,284807.26,9/8/2025,Build,"The first multi-cloud platform, enabling Web3 and AI companies to manage and diversify their data storage across both centralized and decentralized cloud providers. We make it cheaper, simpler, and more flexible to store data.","Web3 and AI demand for storage is rising, yet centralized cloud storage solutions dominate the market, driving up costs in a fragmented market. DePIN solutions like Filecoin and Arweave fall short, serving primarily archival needs with slow performance and limited incentives for storage providers. This forces businesses to rely on centralized providers due to the lack of seamless integration for decentralized storage.

Flashback is the first agentic AI cloud diversification platform, enabling companies to diversify data across both centralized and decentralized cloud storage providers. It offers services such as credential account management, API orchestration, multi-cloud accessibility (AWS, GCP, Filecoin, StorJ), migration and interoperability, and AI-driven cost optimization and resource allocation.

One key layer of the platform is Flashback's own storage infrastructure network (DePIN), designed for Web3 businesses needing enhanced privacy, governance, and fast data retrieval. Built jointly with the Stellar Development Foundation, we have built a prototype leveraging Soroban smart contracts for service-level agreements (SLAs) and quality-of-service (QoS) evaluation. This prototype has shown reliable performances and has been approved by the SDF.

With support from the Stellar Community Fund, we aim to advance R&D on Stellar to develop a decentralized multi-cloud platform that integrates Flashback's DePIN and additional storage providers by developing the following features:

Feature 1: Storage Provision Management

Flashback connects storage infrastructure providers with equipment or cloud storage capacities with the platform's consumers (users and services).  
In this first feature, storage infrastructure providers can register and manage storage capacities across geographical regions, design SLAs, and monetize their infrastructure designed by the function of the smart contract and the platform. Providers from multiple cloud providers (centralized and decentralized) can register, add storage units with specific capacity, and manage their status (e.g. Available, Maintenance, Decommissioning). Stellar's built-in account and transaction systems ensure secure provider registration and operation tracking.

Feature 2: User Allocation

Users who are developers of services using the platform can allocate and manage their storage usage in their reservation space. The platform will gather information from the smart contracts, such as costs and Quality of Services of the storage infrastructure providers, the tracking of their reservation consumption, and the history. In the long term, the consumers will incentivize the storage infrastructure providers for high performance and be able to migrate easily the data and its processes across the different cloud protocols.

Feature 3: Unit Storage States

The provision from the storage infrastructure providers is segmented into unit storage. Unit storage can be reserved by one or multiple consumers. This feature of the smart contract abstracted by the platform allows storage to be tracked as unit states, including different states such as available, reserved, in-use, maintenance, and decommissioning to guarantee the storage infrastructure provider controls its operation and quality-of-services.

Feature 4: Metric System

The metric system is crucial for monitoring the performances of consumers and storage infrastructure providers. Flashback must ensure the drawbacks of existing DePin technologies, which are too slow, can be solved with the network of storage infrastructure providers in Flashback. The metric system encoded in the smart contract and abstracted by the Flashback platform will collect real-time tracking of capacity, usage, and performance metrics of the storage infrastructure providers, but also consumers to drive fast data retrieval for instance.

Feature 5: Security and Ownership Module

Flashback is a platform that must fit with the compliance rules in different countries. We implement strict validation, caller authentication, and owner-specific operations. We leverage Stellar’s robust authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and enforce contract rules to strengthen security and trust in decentralized storage management.

Feature 6: Frontend Libraries/APIs

A good service application can not exist without a good user interface. Flashback offers modular tools to interface with popular Stellar wallets and the Soroban smart contract, enabling developers to integrate Stellar blockchain interactions seamlessly into their applications. Simply, this feature enables the development for third-party applications, expands Stellar’s ecosystem reach, and enhances accessibility for developers building on the platform.

Feature 7: Engine Room Dashboard

Consumers and storage infrastructure providers can track their performance with a dashboard for statistics visualization and interaction emulation for providers and consumers on the testnet. We integrate with Stellar’s testnet to simulate blockchain interactions and provide real-time metrics for data and transaction visualization. We enable operational insights and testing capabilities for developers and stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions and a smoother transition to mainnet deployment.

By developing these features, we want to guarantee the Flashback’s DePIN service will empower businesses to have a comfortable and user-friendly granularity of decentralized storage. Leveraging Stellar’s robust smart contracts and authentication mechanisms, this service guarantees secure, compliant, and scalable operations for the modern Web3 ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to unlock unprecedented control and flexibility for developers, enabling them to drive innovation and achieve a competitive edge in a fragmented cloud market. We want to make Stellar technologies the backbone of our platform to bring more decentralization in the Cloud uses.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AxQCRJJdXUA6e35LaXgHCGVLhgq4yCnywUMhLsOB-0E/edit?usp=sharing,"Technological Success Criteria

The goal is to provide Stellar teams with new analytical and intelligence tools and improve the onboarding UX for new end users.","#1: Cross-Chain Explorer Integration (including Range API)

Range’s Cross-Chain Explorer will incorporate Stellar and data from Allbridge, Axelar, and Tricorn (and other upcoming interoperability protocols), providing real-time, comprehensive asset tracking across the Stellar ecosystem. This will allow users, developers, and product teams to filter and monitor inflows, outflows, bridge routes, and counterparty chains, offering deeper transparency into cross-chain asset movement.

With this integration, users will gain instant visibility into cross-chain liquidity flows, helping them track bridged assets, analyze cross-chain transactions, and detect anomalies or unusual activity. Builders and product teams can evaluate user behavior trends, optimize liquidity strategies, and respond to shifting market conditions more effectively.

Furthermore, all data from this integration will be accessible via the Range API, enabling developers to build custom dashboards, risk monitoring tools, and analytics solutions tailored to their needs. This ensures that projects in the Stellar ecosystem can seamlessly integrate cross-chain intelligence into their applications, improving decision-making and security across the network.

Learn more about the benefits of the Cross-Chain Explorer and how developers can leverage this data for advanced tracking, compliance, and asset security.

#2: Stellar Bridge Explorer

Range will develop a dedicated public Stellar Bridge Explorer to provide a real-time view of asset transfers to and from Stellar over Allbridge, Axelar, and Tricorn (and other upcoming interoperability protocols). 

While the Cross-Chain Explorer integration above will display Stellar-related transactions in our full explorer for every ecosystem, allowing for cross-ecosystem awareness, this bridge explorer will be specific to Stellar only. It will include relevant cross-chain analytics such as inflows and outflows, key addresses, and volume metrics. See https://ibc.range.org/ibc/flows for reference.

The Stellar Bridge Explorer (to be hosted at stellar.range.org) will be similar to usdc.range.org, which tracks USDC transfers across Circle’s CCTP, relied on by the team at dYdX, Circle and others for their day-to-day operations.

#3: Advanced Trail Intelligence for Stellar

We will integrate Stellar into Range’s Trail platform - our leading cross-chain risk, intelligence, and investigation tool. Our platform was instrumental in multiple hack investigations this past year, supporting companies such as Circle, Solana Foundation, and Neutron.

Range Trail will track Stellar wallets’ transaction flows across chains and ecosystems. It will enable transaction flow analysis, user profiling, and cross-chain activity tracking. Teams can visualize asset movements through interactive graphs and address cluster views, making it easier to analyze user behavior, detect suspicious activity, and identify high-risk counterparties This integration streamlines risk management and compliance processes, empowering teams to monitor assets and transactions across ecosystems.

In the event of a security incident, Range Trail will enable detailed forensic investigations, tracking stolen or compromised assets in real-time across multiple ecosystems. This capability will help teams pinpoint where funds have been moved and how they are being distributed and provide critical intelligence for recovery efforts.

Integrating Stellar into Range Trail empowers ecosystem teams, security researchers, and compliance officers with a powerful toolset for risk management, asset monitoring, and real-time blockchain forensics.

It eliminates reliance on centralized randomness sources, ensuring tamper-proof and trustless randomness.

Ensuring pure randomness is critical in decentralized systems because predictable randomness leads to manipulation and exploits. A well-known issue is the last-mover attack (vector bias), where the final participant in a randomness-based event—such as a lottery or validator selection—can delay or withhold their commitment until they see a favorable outcome. This exploit allows malicious actors to influence supposedly fair processes by selectively participating only when the randomness favors them. Without a cryptographic guarantee, many existing blockchain randomness implementations remain vulnerable to such attacks, making them unsuitable for high-stakes applications like DeFi, governance, gaming, and secure voting.

Our current (tentative) approach being the VRF is, the VRF function generates randomness by taking a seed (optional, BytesN) for user-provided entropy, block metadata (BytesN) including block hash and timestamp for unpredictability, and a public identifier (String) like a user address or contract call ID to differentiate requests. The function outputs a 32-byte cryptographically generated random value along with a 64-byte verifiable proof, ensuring the randomness is tamper-proof and can be validated later.

Developers can integrate NebulaVRF in three ways:

1.  On-Chain Soroban Contract – For fully trustless and verifiable randomness, ideal for DeFi, DAO governance, and NFT trait assignment.
    
1.  Fast API Endpoint – For low-latency randomness, useful in gaming, real-time lotteries, and airdrops, with optional on-chain proof verification.
    
1.  Rust-Based SDK (Cargo Package) – For backend applications needing secure randomness without blockchain overhead, such as AI models, or Web3 marketplaces.
    

Use Cases

-   Gaming & Lotteries – Fair dice rolls, loot box rewards, randomized game mechanics.
    
-   NFTs & Metaverse – Randomized trait distribution, rarity assignment.
    
-   DeFi & Airdrops – Random token distributions, fair reward allocation.
    
-   DAO Governance – Unbiased committee selection, randomized voting mechanics.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8eMVrUC_9CpP5jtUzXRlccSgLNRw__s/view?usp=sharing,"Success for NebulaVRF is defined by its adoption within the Stellar ecosystem as a reliable, on-chain randomness provider. A successful outcome includes at least 10+ projects integrating NebulaVRF for use cases in DeFi, gaming, DAOs, and NFTs. The VRF contract will be live on Stellar Mainnet, providing trustless randomness while maintaining high uptime and low-cost execution. The API should process 1,000+ monthly requests, and the Rust SDK should be actively used in backend applications. Developer engagement will be measured through GitHub activity, contributions, and discord discussions. Long-term success includes establishing NebulaVRF as the go-to randomness solution for anyone building in Soroban or Stellar.",https://nebulavrf.vercel.app/,https://github.com/NebulaVRF,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8EPL0YPzII,Yes,"#### 1. Target Audience

-   Primary Users: Soroban dApp developers (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, gaming).
    
-   Secondary Users: Backend developers needing verifiable randomness (via API/SDK).
    

#### 2. Launch Strategy

Phase 1: Developer Beta (Testnet) – Month 1-2

-   Deploy Soroban Testnet Contract & launch NebulaVRF API.
    
-   Release Rust SDK (Cargo) for backend integration.
    
-   Conduct developer outreach via Stellar forums, twitter & Discord.  
    

Phase 2: Mainnet Release – Month 3-4

-   Deploy VRF contract on Soroban Mainnet.
    
-   Provide developer documentation + GitHub repo.
    
-   Offer bounties for early adopters.  
    

Phase 3: Adoption & Growth – Month 5+

-   Host hackathons & developer tutorials on youtube.
    
-   Secure integrations with major Soroban projects.
    
-   Promote through twitter, discord & ecosystem channels.","NebulaVRF is in the idea and technical design phase, aiming to build a native on-chain randomness beacon for Soroban. While not yet launched, most major blockchains have built-in VRF, which Stellar currently lacks. Ethereum uses Chainlink VRF, Polkadot has BABE-based randomness, and Solana integrates an oracle-assisted VRF. Without a trustless randomness source, Soroban developers must rely on off-chain randomness, centralized oracles, or block metadata, all of which introduce security risks and manipulation vectors.

Current Alternatives & Their Limitations

1.  Off-Chain Randomness – Manipulatable and unverifiable.
    
1.  External Oracles – Requires trust in third-party providers (e.g., Chainlink, not available on Soroban).
    
1.  Manual Entropy (Block Hashes, Timestamps) – Predictable and vulnerable to manipulation.
    

Why NebulaVRF is Better

1.  Fully On-Chain & Trustless – Eliminates reliance on oracles.
    
1.  Low-Cost & Efficient – No extra transaction fees like Chainlink VRF.
    
1.  Flexible Integration – Supports on-chain contract calls, API access, and an SDK for backend randomness.
    
1.  Secure & Manipulation-Resistant – Uses commit-reveal and threshold cryptography to prevent last-mover bias.
    

Our initial outreach to Stellar developers confirms demand for a VRF solution, enabling secure, verifiable randomness for DeFi, gaming, and governance applications. NebulaVRF fills this gap, unlocking new possibilities for trustless applications on Soroban.","Deliverable 1: Cryptographic Randomness Logic in Rust

Brief Description:  
The goal is to implement mathematically sound randomness that avoids predictable patterns like last-mover bias (vector bias)—a flaw where the final participant can influence randomness outcomes.

We will build a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) using threshold cryptography (BLS/Schnorr) and a commit-reveal scheme to prevent tampering. This will form the core randomness module for all NebulaVRF components

How to Measure Completion:

-   Rust-based VRF implementation with randomness proof generation.
    
-   Passes randomness tests (NIST or Chi-Square etc.).
    
-   Mathematical approach documented for transparency.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 1-2

Budget: $8000

Deliverable 2: NebulaVRF API for Fast Randomness

Brief Description:  
Some use cases, like real-time web3 gaming and loot boxes, need fast randomness over trustless & costly randomness. The API will allow dApps to fetch high-speed, cryptographically strong randomness, while providing an optional proof submission to Soroban for on-chain verification if required.

How to Measure Completion:

-   API live with /get-random endpoint.
    
-   Developers can fetch randomness & optionally verify it on-chain.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 2

Budget: $6000","Deliverable 3: Deploy Soroban VRF Contract on Testnet

Brief Description:  
For DeFi, NFTs, and DAO governance, fully on-chain randomness is required to ensure trustlessness. We will create a VRF contract where the logic will be an abstraction of NebulaVRF’s core randomness module. We’ll then deploy it on Soroban Testnet, allowing developers to invoke it for verifiable randomness. Users would have to pay gas to invoke the smart contract.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Soroban contract live on Testnet.
    
-   Developers can request randomness via on-chain invoking (via Stellar JS SDK or RPC Calls)
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 3

Budget: $6000

Deliverable 4: NebulaVRF SDK (Cargo Package)

Brief Description:  
Some applications, like backend logic in Web3 marketplaces or AI models, don’t need an on-chain dependency but still require strong randomness. We will release a Rust Cargo package that Soroban developers can integrate for local randomness generation, with again an optional proof submission feature for verification on-chain.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Cargo package published & documented.
    
-   Developers can generate randomness locally & verify it on-chain if needed.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 4

Budget: $7000","Deliverable 5: Deploy Soroban VRF Contract on Mainnet + Maintainence

Brief Description:

Once tested, the VRF contract will go live on Stellar Mainnet, enabling trustless, fully decentralized randomness for all dApps. This phase also includes ongoing maintenance, ensuring high availability, security updates, and optimizations to keep the contract efficient and cost-effective for developers.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Mainnet contract deployment successful.
    
-   Developers actively using the contract in production.
    
-   Performance monitoring and bug fixes implemented as needed.
    
-   Optimizations for gas efficiency and security patches applied.

We are not targeting crypto newcomers at launch.

To reach our audience, we will leverage X Spaces, influencer collaborations, targeted threads, and active engagement on Telegram and Discord. We are already in discussions with two potential large liquidity providers. Customers will access the platform directly through Laina. Our marketing strategy focuses on attracting liquidity and engaging crypto enthusiasts to balance borrowing demand.

The platform differentiates itself through its ease of use, competitive rates, and unique features on the Stellar network, such as collateral swapping and potential passkey bridging (needs clarification). Compared to competitors like Blend on Stellar and AAVE outside of Stellar, our platform aims to offer a superior user experience.

Our launch strategy follows a ""bigbang"" mainnet release with staged testnet launches beforehand. We will track Total Value Locked (TVL), the number of loans, and revenue to assess platform traction. Post-launch, monitoring the number of unique addresses in loan pools and the lending-to-borrowing ratio will help guide optimization efforts.

Post-launch, we will focus on engaging early adopters and expanding our user base. The first 30 days will prioritize attracting initial users with special rewards, followed by efforts to bring capital from outside the blockchain at 60 days. By 90 days, the focus will shift to increasing user adoption and liquidity.

Key assumptions include the availability of free liquidity within the Stellar ecosystem and interest from Stellar enthusiasts. Risks involve potential low liquidity and regulatory changes. Technical considerations include non-upgradeable decentralized contracts.

To maintain decentralization, we will carefully design incentives for early adopters. Stakeholder engagement will involve direct outreach to teams, stakeholders, and the existing Stellar community through events and personal connections.","We have created a Discord channel that has currently 35 users interested and 5 individuals with tester roles. We have received a $10,000 award from Stellar Kickstart and we also won the best oracle based smart contract competition hosted by Reflector. This award was worth 20,000 XRF (~$6,000).

#### 2. General Marketing Strategy

-   DeFi and Crypto Partnerships: Collaborate with prominent DeFi players and tokenized RWA issuers to promote the PMS. Potential partners include stablecoin projects, tokenized asset platforms, and custodians.
    

We already have a close relationship with a number of Defi, Custodians, RWA related companies, for example:- (Meria, InceptionLRT, Parfin, Komainu, Fireblocks, Hashkey, DSG Group, etc…) and we will reach out to them to organise 

-   Content Marketing: Publish whitepapers, blog posts, and video tutorials on the benefits of using Autowhale on Stellar. Highlight unique features like real-time portfolio analytics, advanced execution strategies (e.g., TWAP/VWAP), and tokenized RWA support.
    

  

-   Social Media Campaigns: Utilize LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube to run targeted campaigns that highlight Stellar-specific integrations and the system's ability to manage tokenized assets efficiently. https://www.linkedin.com/company/autowhale/ , https://x.com/AutowhaleNet , New blog launching in March 2025
    

  

#### 3. Customer Acquisition

-   Direct Outreach: Engage with mid-sized crypto funds, hedge funds, and asset managers that currently operate on Stellar or are looking to expand into tokenized RWA trading.
    

  

-   Trial and Incentives: Offer a free trial for early adopters to experience the PMS's benefits. Provide discounted pricing for funds trading on Stellar-based DEXs during the initial launch phase.
    

  

-   Major Events: Use major events like Token2049, Digital Asset Summit etc.. to connect with and reach out to new funds and introduce this new solution. 
    

By leveraging co-hosted events with Stellar, targeted marketing efforts, and a customer-centric approach, we aim to drive adoption, strengthen the Stellar ecosystem, and establish Autowhale’s PMS as the leading solution for managing tokenized assets and trading on Stellar.","So far we have made over $550K in revenue from 6 clients

95% of this revenue is from our infrastructure as a service and 5% from API broker fees

Partnership with Kraken Institutional:- We partnered with Kraken Institutional https://lu.ma/zvkipkau to run institutional focused side event during Emergence Conference in Europe. We had over 600 registrations from funds and digital asset managers. Due to limited venue capacity we only accepted 45 funds and high quality Kraken institutional clients to attend our event.

API Brokerage partnership with various exchanges: We have partnerships with multiple exchanges where Autowhale is paid 20 - 25% of the exchange’s revenue where the volume was increased or added by Autowhale’s clients.","**Brief Description

Key customer segments:  
  
1. Crypto whales on Stellar: Communications targeted at crypto whales holding XML and tokenized RWA.  
2. Crypto whales on Solana: Bridging of JSOL (LST of JPool, a liquid staking platform on Solana) and targeted communications.  
3. Asset managers and market makers on Stellar: Targeted communications.  
4. Retail customers on Stellar: Targeted communications, including via fiat.  
5. MoneyGram: Communication with the team to find out if they are interested in depositing liquidity for a short term.  
  
Potential marketing channels/tools to be considered:  
  
* Liquidity incentives: Offer short-term rewards for bootstrapping liquidity.  
* Community engagement: Host AMAs, webinars, and educational content about DeFi on Stellar, leveraging existing communities on platforms like Discord, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter).  
* Strategic partnerships: Collaborate with prominent DeFi aggregators, analytics platforms, and yield-farming communities to list and showcase the protocol, ensuring broader visibility.  
* Cross-promotion: Tap into our existing user base from other projects—such as those on Solana—and provide bridging incentives for users who bring their liquidity from other chains to Stellar.","As discussed with the Stellar team, the network has identified a strong need for a lending protocol with a looping feature to diversify and expand its DeFi ecosystem. JLending will add value for Stellar by introducing additional utilization for XLM tokens and creating new yield opportunities for liquidity providers, including the holders of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). Given that leveraged yield strategies currently secure substantial TVL on other blockchains—nearly $28B on Ethereum and about $2.5B on Solana (according to defillama.com)—it’s evident that an efficient, low-cost lending protocol could significantly benefit Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem.  
  
Our team’s extensive experience in decentralized finance makes us well-positioned to build JLending. Our most prominent projects on Solana include:  
* JPool: a liquid staking platform offering flexible staking options and a suite of powerful tools, with a TVL of ~1M SOL and a community of 30K+ users. Link: https://jpool.one/  
* Smart Validator Toolkit (SVT): an all-in-one validator cockpit that automates the processes of bootstrapping and maintaining Solana nodes. SVT is designed for users—both crypto newbies and pros—who wish to be relieved of tedious bootstrapping and maintenance when running a node on the Solana network. Link: https://svt.one/  
* Albus Protocol: a highly adaptable infrastructure for monetizable decentralized identities (DID), providing privacy and compliance tools for secure identity verification. Link: https://albus.finance/  
  
Notes:  
* In the social media fields, we have provided links to different social media accounts related to our team and products so you can have a better understanding of who we are and what we do.  
* In the Other Chains field, we have indicated ""Solana"": we can use existing bridges to bring JSOL, JPool's LST, to Stellar.","# Tranche 1 -- MVP

It serves as an oracle for projects like prediction markets, insurance protocols, derivatives, and cross-chain bridges, providing data ranging from cryptocurrency prices to sports and political events.","Stellar soroban contracts are currently being used for onChain contract development. I have done some initial work in this github repo(https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle) which i plan on expanding.

-   OnChain Optimistic Oracle (OOO) contract
    
    -   The OOO is used to assert truths about the world which are verified using an optimistic escalation game.
        
    -   Core idea: an asserter makes a statement about a truth, calling ""assertTruth"". If this statement is not challenged, it is taken as the state of the world. If challenged, it is arbitrated using the Data verification engine or if configured, an escalation manager. Escalation managers enable integrations to define their own security properties and tradeoffs, enabling the notion of ""sovereign security"".
        
-   OnChain Voting Oracle contract
    
    -   Since all transactions are public we have to use extra tricks to keep some things temporarily hidden. Let’s say we need input like an answer to a quiz or a move in a game from a group of players. We don’t want these players to be able to just watch the blockchain for their competitors’ answers. What we’ll do is have everyone hash their answer and submit that first (the commit). Next, everyone will submit their real answer (the reveal) and we can prove on-chain that it hashes to the committed value. This interaction is handled by the Voting Oracle contract in soroban
        
-   OnChain Staking Contract
    
    -   Staking contract enabling XLM to be locked up by stakers to earn a pro rata share of a fixed emission rate. This contract also handles the staking, unstaking and reward retrieval logic. There won't be any new XLM token generated, but the yield will be generated based on the asserter/disputer lost staked. Tentative staking interface below;
        
            #[derive(Debug)]
            pub struct VoterStake {
                stake: u128,                           // XLM staked by the staker.
                pending_unstake: u128,                 // XLM in unstake cooldown period, waiting to be unstaked.
                pending_stakes: HashMap<u32, u128>,    // If a voter stakes during an active reveal, stake is pending.
                rewardspaidper_token: u128,          // Internal tracker used in the calculation of pro-rata share of rewards.
                outstanding_rewards: u128,             // Accumulated rewards that have not yet been claimed.
                unapplied_slash: i128,                 // Used to track unapplied slashing in the case of bisected rounds.
                nextindexto_process: u64,            // The next request index that a staker is susceptible to be slashed on.
                unstake_time: u64,                     // Time that a staker can unstake. Used to determine if cooldown has passed.
                delegate: Option<String>,              // Address a staker has delegated to. The delegate can commit/reveal/claimRestake rewards.
            }
        
    
-   OnChain Reward Distribution contract
    
    -   Reward Distribution is a sub contract that Staking Contract inherits. Rewards can either be distributed per epoch or based on the end of challenge period. The unstaking of reward will have to go through a cooldown period
        

-   Export a pluggable interface for other Soroban contracts to use it easily
    
    -   Build necessary adaptars for the oracle contract interface to be easily pluggable in other projects
        
    -   The adapters can be universally used or be changed subject to a specific project need
        

-   OffChain Data Verification Engine (DVE)
    
    -   This is an offChain component which will be written in Rust to read/write to Stellar blockchain
        
    -   DVE Purpose: Resolves disputes in the Soroban optimistic oracle by verifying disputed data.
        
    -   Dispute Process: Ex: A price request is submitted to the DVE, triggering a vote among SOO stakers.
        
    -   Voting Period: Voting lasts x hrs
        
    -   Voting Criteria: SOO stakers use off-chain price feeds to guide their votes.
        
    -   Final Price: The DVE aggregates votes to determine the final asset price for the given timestamp.",https://www.figma.com/deck/pEr2MvlTAa5ErIVBuxQ7GG/Soroban-Opt.-Oracle?node-id=1-32&t=pmd69aKDfgZ30lq4-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1,"Expected success criteria by the end of the grant;

-   Integrate with 3 different Stellar projects enabling real-time data flow from the oracle to their platform
    
-   Have > 10 stakers consistently voting and earning rewards using our system
    
-   The rewards and security of the system grows as the project grows
    
-   Become a standard for onChain dispute handling on Stellar ecosystem
    
-   Keep the system economically secure and have strong security against spams, bots and malicious users.",https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle,https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7_pCM9KtPEXOV7B7H0oykRZ4mDlIiew/view?usp=sharing,Yes,"Engage the Stellar Developer Ecosystem:

-   Build early traction and trust by connecting with Stellar ecosystem founders and key developers.
    
-   Foster relationships with influential projects within the Stellar ecosystem and integrate them into the SOO service.
    

Community Outreach through Developer Networks:

-   Collaborate with Stellar-focused developer communities to promote the adoption of the SOO framework.
    
-   Launch small bounty programs to incentivize the creation and use of SOO service
    

Encourage XLM holders to stake their token for rewards:

-   with SOO one can earn rewards by voting on correct source of truth. This can be a big incentive for XLM holders to stake and earn extra yield on the side","The Stellar Optimistic Oracle (SOO) is currently in the process of being deployed to the Stellar Testnet. This integration is pivotal for expanding the range of use cases that can be built on Stellar, from DeFi (decentralized finance) applications to synthetic assets, prediction markets, and real-world data tracking.

As part of this deployment, we are conducting several test flights to rigorously test the functionality and reliability of the Optimistic Oracle within the Stellar Testnet environment. These test flights involve the deployment of specific smart contracts that simulate real-world data requests, dispute resolutions, and data verification processes. In addition to the technical deployment, I am also in active communication with several other Stellar-funded projects that are well-positioned to leverage the capabilities of the Stellar Optimistic Oracle. These projects span across multiple sectors, including finance, data marketplaces, and NFT platforms, and could significantly benefit from integrating this oracle technology. The goal is to explore collaborative opportunities where SOO can be incorporated into existing Stellar-based applications or be used to create new innovative products that require reliable and decentralized data feeds. These projects are looking for ways to incorporate off-chain data for use in:

-   Automated price feeds for decentralized trading or financial derivatives.
    
-   Synthetic assets that track the value of real-world commodities and assets.
    
-   Event-driven smart contracts in prediction markets or decentralized insurance.
    
-   Cross-chain interoperability, where data from other blockchains or traditional systems can be fed into Stellar-based ecosystems.","1.  [Deliverable 1: MVP]

Benefits for Stellar Ecosystem:  
  
Firstly, we are able to bring immediate scale to the Stellar and, importantly, a diverse client base using our White Label product. This will not only contribute to increased ledger activity and attract new users and liquidity to the network, but also strengthen Stellar's reputation as a preferred blockchain for RWA tokenization.

  
Secondly, by having Stellar as one of our strategic blockchain partners, we can help drive attention to XLM as a leader in the real estate sector and further showcase blockchain's scalability with practical, real-world applications. Through this integration, we will bring awareness and an untapped user base to the Stellar ecosystem by engaging with developers, lenders, real estate companies and fund, fostering innovation and driving adoption of Stellar for tokenized assets. 

  
Lastly, we believe the UK is poised to grow in significance as a Digital Asset Hub based on regulatory changes and appetite from government. Our platform is strategically positioned to deliver a market-leading solution tailored specifically to real estate debt and equity, offering unique value to the Stellar ecosystem from domain experts.",https://www.verseprop.com,https://app.storylane.io/share/l2lj2i6qap6p,https://share.vidyard.com/watch/WBVfvQTVsB8RteA1dsw8Sd?,Yes,"Structuring: Start the process of moving asset structures offshore to take advantage of tax benefits and leverage newly emerging tokenization legislation. We currently operate a UK SPV but there is growing demand from international investors for UK based assets. This is being done in collaboration with CMS Law.

Satellite Office: Open satellite office in UAE to support our collaboration agreement and regional expansion. Participating in the Fintech trade mission in Hong Kong to establish distribution in Asia via strategic partnerships, akin to efforts in the UAE. We are currently being assisted by DIFC DIFC | Leading Financial Hub in the MEASA Region and HKinvest InvestHK - Government Department of Foreign Direct Investment | InvestHK  
Leverage Existing Network: The primary focus of our Go-To-Market Plan has been our - domain expertise, where we can leverage our existing networks with developers, real estate companies and funds giving us access to high quality assets, deal flow and investors. We also rely on a proven track record, having been one of the first platforms to issued tokenized real estate credit with further case studies to follow for both the Marketplace and White Label service.  
  
Other forms of customer acquisition include Community Building and Education, where we foster engagement with speakerships and educational content on tokenized real estate. We will be speaking at a number of conferences including Rosenblatt, Digital Asset Regulation Summit and a number of private steering groups with real estate companies.","Since our last update, Verseprop has made significant progress in regulatory compliance, product development, and strategic partnerships, positioning itself as a market leader in the real estate tokenization sector.

As referenced in our last submission, Verseprop has now formally signed a broker-dealer LOI to offer compliant and scalable services in the UAE, which will sit alongside its FCA Appointed Representative status in the UK ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.  
  
Since launching in September 2024, Verseprop has made significant progress in regulatory compliance, product development, and strategic partnerships, positioning itself as a market leader in the real estate tokenization space.

It has already completed a tokenized credit transaction for £240,000 and started to onboard several private real estate companies. In addition, Verseprop’s white-label service empowers real estate businesses to adopt blockchain technology under their branding. Please see link:  
nexus.mavryk.org/contract/KT1CUKh4VGXuT1vJqgebNwFJZ3CmBRBb2Hm3

Verseprop’s collaborations with globally recognized organizations ensure our platform remains at the forefront of compliance and innovation. Some examples include:

-   RICS Technology Partner: Aligning with global real estate standards.
    
-   Strata Global: Principal firm overseeing our Verseprop's regulation as an FCA approved Appointed Representative.
    
-   VARA UAE: Collaboration with a Dubai-based partner regulated by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority.
    
-   Amina Bank (ex Seba): On-ramp and off ramping for both individuals and corporates.
    
-   CMS Law: Part of the EquIP accelerator programme from one of the world's largest law firms.
    

  
The UK property market alone offers substantial potential. The market for tokenized real estate in the UK is still in its early stages but rapidly expanding, driven by the increasing demand for alternative investments, exposure to real estate and blockchain-based solutions. With £1.3 trillion in total UK commercial real estate assets and a growing interest in alternative investments, the potential market size is substantial, especially when the model can be replicated in multiple jurisdictions, which Verseprop intends to do.  

Verseprop already has an existing network of private wealth investors (c.75 with the ability to invest £5k up to £5m in a single deal), however where our model is truly compelling is in its integration with existing businesses. This approach allows us to rapidly scale both the volume of assets brought on-chain and the number of users.  

We also continue to build our Partnerships through broker-dealer relationships that support our growth ambitions and will be part of a trade mission to Hong Kong later this year, as part of an invite from innovative UK Fintechs.  

Our milestones reflect Verseprop's commitment to delivering a compliant, scalable, and innovative platform for real estate tokenization.","Develop Security Token Architecture Using Stellar

There are two big work packages we're going to build in parallel:

The first is to develop a carbon sinking smart contract to enable other Soroban developers to automate compensating for CO₂ emissions through their own contracts, by sending financial support to verified ecosystem restoration projects. We also need to add support for Soroban in our backend so that there is no functional difference between sinking carbon through classic Stellar and through smart contracts. This will introduce the flexibility we need to appeal to builders who are increasingly using Soroban in their products.

  
The second package is to finalize the development of our dApp where individuals and small businesses can sink carbon. We have a list of UX issues to improve, and want to do a second round of usability testing to end up with a product that people love to use. This includes communicating clearly how we have a positive impact on climate and biodiversity, because most of our customers have no prior experience with the voluntary carbon market.",https://github.com/stellarcarbon/sc-website/blob/develop/docs/architecture.md,"We define our success in terms of integrity and the volume of carbon sunk. The impact projects that are supported through Stellarcarbon need to have a science-based, quantifiable positive impact on biodiversity, climate, and vulnerable communities. Without that integrity, other metrics don’t matter.

The volume of carbon sunk through Stellarcarbon determines the magnitude of the collective impact made by our customers. This volume is most meaningful when it wouldn’t have happened through other means, or when it replaces the use of eco-credits of lesser integrity than ours. When volume moves from another high-integrity service to Stellarcarbon, it’s still positive for the Stellar ecosystem, but it represents less of an environmental benefit. Finally, there’s the risk of compensation being used for emissions that could have been avoided or reduced at a similar cost, which is detrimental to our success.

We have calculated the minimum volume that is required for the longevity of our project. It is determined by the break even point where our gross profit equals our operational expenses minus payroll (which can be zero if needed). With our current pricing model, we need to sell 750 tonnes of carbon per year to cover our costs. Our target is to reach this amount 6 months after the launch date.",https://test.stellarcarbon.io/,https://github.com/stellarcarbon/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX9ar7vkPVQ,Yes,"Stellarcarbon targets two fundamentally distinct customer segments: retail users and integration partners. While each segment is multifaceted, we can offer a personalized approach to integration partners, and have to think about retail users in terms of profiling and personas.

Retail segment

We define our retail segment as: the customers that want to access eco-credits to claim the environmental benefit for themselves, and who want to interact with Stellarcarbon through our dApp.

Retail users on Stellar

People who already have a non-custodial Stellar wallet or are interested in installing one, experience the least onboarding friction. They don’t have to create any accounts, and the journey from landing on our dApp the first time to sinking their first carbon has taken our pilot users less than two minutes on average. Their second time usually goes even faster.

Our main task in marketing to this audience is to answer questions that are not about Stellar: What is the voluntary carbon market? What does it mean for a carbon credit to have “community and biodiversity benefits”? Why would I spend money on this? How can I see that my contribution actually has a positive impact?

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   create better informative content about ReFi and Stellarcarbon
    
-   publish testimonials by our pilot customers
    
-   host and participate in X spaces and Discord events, working together with Lumen Loop and Stellar Global
    
-   leverage our early adopters as ambassadors
    

ReFi enthusiasts

There is a dedicated and growing community of crypto-savvy people who are passionate about regenerative finance (ReFi). They have an affinity for other blockchains, most notably Celo, Polygon, and Solana. We want to introduce them into the Stellar ecosystem, and pave the way for other ReFi pioneers building on Stellar, such as Geld Network and netzero.kiwi.

We have been active in the ReFi community for several years (as individuals), on X and Discord. Tribalism has been a barrier to promoting Stellar and Stellarcarbon on some of the most active Discord servers. Through our network, we have gained access to some more chain-agnostic venues (thanks Evan!), which will help Stellarcarbon be part of the conversation.

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   announce our launch in the CARBON copy newsletter
    
-   become a highlighted project on Giveth
    
-   engage with the ReFi DAO community
    
-   provide tutorials on our website on how to set up a Stellar wallet and bridge stablecoins
    
-   post regular updates on the impact projects we support
    

New-to-crypto users

One of our pilot customers was a first-time dApp user, who had also never used a non-custodial wallet before. We onboarded him from scratch, providing limited wallet installation and on-ramping instructions. Including setup, sinking carbon took around 15 minutes the first time, and 5 minutes the second time. Overall, this was a good experience for everyone involved and we expect him to be a repeat customer.

The most important characteristic of customers coming from outside the crypto space is that they don’t want to pay with digital assets. To serve this audience, we’ll need to enable debit card payments through a payments processor. The second is that they’re not that interested in the technology, and experience managing and securing their own keypair as friction.

We can smoothen this journey by building in support for smart wallets with passkeys and/or account recovery (SEP-30). Stellarcarbon can take care of account creation, reserves, and fees, without having to become a custodial wallet provider. Such a solution is out of scope for this submission, and we’re considering it as a post-launch addition. When we are ready to onboard new-to-crypto users, we will focus on simple, relatable campaigns that emphasize the positive environmental impact rather than blockchain technology.

Integration segment

The integration segment consists of builders that want to automate their interactions with Stellarcarbon. They can give their users access to eco-credits, claim the environmental benefit for themselves, or do both. These builders are already on Stellar/Soroban, or are willing to join the ecosystem.

Our strategy for engaging with integration partners is tailored. We have the capacity for 1-on-1 conversations with builders who are interested in integrating Stellarcarbon into their software. One of the uncertainties for potential integrators is how much demand for eco-credits there will be within their user base. Having our own retail customers really helps to prove the demand to them. We haven’t been actively reaching out to other builders for the past year or so, and are going to ramp up these efforts paired with our dApp launch.

To reach this audience, we would like to:

-   add an overview of software integration opportunities on our website
    
-   clarify that we can split our sales margin with integration partners
    
-   show builders of end-user applications how easy it is to integrate Stellarcarbon into their checkout flow
    
-   ask developers of wallets that don’t currently support dApps how we can help to give their users access
    
-   reach out to infrastructure providers with an offer to help track their emissions (using tools like CodeCarbon) and reach carbon neutrality
    
-   offer a bounty to use DeFi yield for automatic carbon retirements
    
-   participate in industry events and increase our visibility there","'-   People are already using our earliest demo version app on mainnet right now. We have more than $240 revenue just from demos, 15 distinct pilot users doing 29 transactions in total. This does not include testnet stats, since we don’t preserve data across testnet resets. To verify these stats, see the transaction history in our API, or on stellar.expert.
    
-   GiveCredit will use our Soroban contract to further automate carbon credit retirements from the donations of their users.
    
-   We have been approached by the lead dev of DeFindex (PaltaLabs), indicating a clear demand for real world eco-assets on Soroban.","[Deliverable 1] Soroban Interface MVP

-   Develop the full sink carbon contract as specified in the technical architecture. Launch a CARBON/USDC liquidity pool on testnet Soroswap. Develop a replenish pool feature in the Stellarcarbon backend.
    
-   How to measure completion: contract repo is available on our GitHub featuring the sink carbon contract. The contract can be deployed and invoked in a local sandbox. Our liquidity pool is visible in Soroswap. Whenever the CARBON price there deviates significantly from the price returned by our API, the pool will be automatically rebalanced within minutes.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 8 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 60 hours development + 60 hours testing x $100/hr = $12,000
    

[Deliverable 2] dApp frontend UX, content, and styling

-   Testing has revealed numerous improvements that we want to make to the UX. Most revolve around input validation and error handling. We have identified what we can do to guide users through a successful sink carbon flow. Several testers have asked for emissions estimates (e.g. calculators) to be further integrated into our dApp. We’ll rewrite some of our text content and improve on the accessibility of the page layouts.
    
-   How to measure completion: the dApp looks and feels complete. A tester can use test.stellarcarbon.io to sink carbon on testnet and manage their account. Some data connections may still be mocked at this stage.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 8 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 50 hours development + 40 hours testing x $100/hr = $9,000
    

These two objectives can be completed independently and in parallel. We’ll have two developers working on them simultaneously, and there are no direct dependencies between the deliverables.","[Deliverable 3] dApp usability improvements

-   We’ll launch the full dApp frontend on testnet at the beginning of this milestone. Our previous testers and newly recruited ones will be provided with a testing protocol, which we’ll use to gather feedback and sort out any remaining issues.
    
-   How to measure completion: a usability testing report will be provided.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 12 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 40 hours usability testing + 40 hours iteration x $100/hr = $8,000
    

[Deliverable 4] Automate retirements for testing

-   After sinking carbon, the sinking transaction needs to trigger a “retirement” of carbon credits in the Verra Registry. In our testnet app, the corresponding amount of credits currently isn’t retired because the Verra Registry lacks a testing environment for us to develop against. We want to mock this part of the retirement process in our own backend to provide a testing experience that is comparable with the real Verra Registry connection.
    
-   How to measure completion: pending retirement balances are automatically retired (after some delay) in our dApp.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 10 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 30 hours development + 20 hours testing x $100/hr = $5,000
    

[Deliverable 5] Complete Soroban Interface

-   After deploying our smart contract to testnet, we’ll start integration testing with at least one partner. This will deliver us the insights we need to improve the contract and its documentation. Support for the contract will be added to our backend, including event ingestion and their post-processing into data structures that are compatible with our classic Stellar data.
    
-   How to measure completion: sink carbon events (i.e. atomic swaps with metadata) that are generated in Soroban are visible in our testnet API and in the dApp.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 12 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 45 hours development + 25 hours testing x $100/hr = $7,000
    

While working on this milestone, we will also increase our engagement with the Stellar community. There will be testing opportunities for end-users as well as for developers. As we have done in the past, we’ll want to on-ramp these testers as pilot customers and integration partners.","[Deliverable 6] Soroban Integration on mainnet

-   Before we can launch on mainnet, we want our contract to be audited and well documented. Since it ties into a larger system, we also need to document the integration between the Soroban events and our backend and the API it exposes. We’ll launch the Soroswap liquidity pool on mainnet. The automatic replenishment feature will be adapted for and deployed in our mainnet backend. We’ll also develop a backup mechanism that publishes ingested contract events in our public data repository.
    
-   How to measure completion: it’s possible to obtain and sink carbon through Soroban contract invocations. The resulting events will be visible in our dApp, API, and will show up in our data repo after some time. An audit report of the contract has been published by a reputable 3rd party (provided we have been granted audit credits from the SDF Audit Bank).
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 20 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 40 hours development + 20 hours testing + 40 hours audit process x $100/hr = $10,000
    

[Deliverable 7] Fully automate retirements for mainnet

-   There are some tricky parts in automating retirements for mainnet. We currently still have a human-in-the-loop process, because errors made in the Verra Registry are immutable. The logic for processing retirements has been specified, but we have yet to identify all edge cases. We’ll develop the solution incrementally, starting with the simple cases for which we haven’t needed manual intervention, and proceeding towards the most challenging case of batching fractional retirements from multiple users into a community certificate.
    
-   How to measure completion: sinking transactions will show as retired in our dApp as soon as possible, within a couple of minutes when we can generate an individual certificate. Check the Verra Registry to verify that the retirement has actually happened. Individual certificates will also be emailed to eligible accounts directly by Verra.
    
-   Estimated date of completion: 24 weeks after award announcement.
    
-   Budget: 50 hours development + 20 hours testing x $100/hr = $9,000
    

[Deliverable 8] Launch our dApp (retail shop)

-   This is a festive moment: we’ll go live with our dApp on www.stellarcarbon.io, replacing our old website. There should not be much left to do; all the features and content have been completed in other deliverables. We’ll configure our CI/CD pipeline to deploy the production version of the dApp, do some manual testing, and update our DNS records. After we have fully launched, we’ll continue to focus our efforts on marketing and business development. Onward!
    
-   How to measure completion: our dApp is live and fully functional on www.stellarcarbon.io.

SorobanHooks,SCF #33,No-Code Stellar Event Automation & Flows,SorobanHooks,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recwkBsoW10eSCw85,Awarded,67,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$25000.00,$25000.00,86855.46,,Build,"A real-time webhook-driven platform for developers to automate contract deployment, event monitoring, and cross-chain transactions on Stellar and Soroban.","Problem:

Developers and non-technical users in the Stellar ecosystem face significant challenges when setting up real-time event tracking for on-chain and cross-chain activities. The process can take up to a week, requiring them to:

-   Understand API flows.
    
-   Set up servers and integrate with Stellar APIs.
    
-   Write custom code for each specific event, which varies by product and workflow.
    

Over time, managing this setup at scale becomes increasingly difficult due to:

-   High costs and resource demands.
    
-   Challenges in tracking failed or pending transactions, unusual activities, and system health.
    

While developers have the technical capability, this process is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and lacks a simple plug-and-play solution. Non-technical users, on the other hand, are left with no feasible options to implement such solutions.

Solution:

Sorobanhooks is an all-in-one automation and real-time event tracking platform tailored for the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem. It simplifies and streamlines operations with:

-   Plug-and-play webhooks and integrations with third-party platforms like Slack or Telegram.
    
-   Customizable workflows with real-time event data and analytics dashboards.
    
-   Cross-chain activity tracking and reporting tools for seamless scalability.
    
-   Additional features like smart contract testing and deployment in just a few clicks.
    

This solution drastically reduces the time, cost (up to $100k in year depending on scale), and effort for developers and product owners, enabling them to scale their projects efficiently while maintaining real-time oversight and control.

Product & Features:

1.  Soroban Event Notifier to track contract events,
    
1.  Soroban Transaction Tracker for live updates on transaction statuses,
    
1.  Soroban Balance Watcher to monitor account balances,
    
1.  Soroban Contract Deployer for seamless contract deployment
    
1.  Soroban Cross-Chain Bridge Monitor to track cross-chain transfers.
    

How to Use:

1.  Sign Up: The developer signs up on Sorobanhooks and creates an account.
    
1.  Create a New Project: The developer creates a new project within Sorobanhooks to track event or deploy smart contract.
    
1.  Configure Webhooks: They set up webhooks for specific events, such as contract deployment, token transfers, or balance changes.
    
1.  Deploy Contract or import : Using the Sorobanhooks interface, the developer deploys their Soroban smart contract or import
    
1.  Real-Time Monitoring: As events occur (e.g., a token transfer or contract state change), the webhooks automatically notify the developer’s endpoint with real-time updates.
    
1.  Action Automation: The developer can automate workflows based on these notifications, such as executing additional contract actions or triggering external services
    

Demand From Market :

1.  Developer Bottlenecks : Developers want a plug-and-play solution to automate repetitive tasks like event tracking, transaction monitoring, and smart contract deployments, freeing up resources for core development work.
    
1.  Expanding Ecosystem : A platform that bridges multi-chain monitoring and automation within Stellar and Soroban is critical for this growing audience.
    
1.  Inclusion of Non-Tech Users : A tool like Sorobanhooks simplifies access for non-technical users, making blockchain technology more inclusive and enabling faster adoption.
    
1.  Current Market Gaps : A centralized, scalable platform eliminates these pain points by providing an all-in-one solution for automation, reporting, and monitoring.
    
1.  Expanded Demand with Mobile & Web Push Notification Integrations: In addition to the real-time event monitoring and cross-chain tracking, there is increasing demand for mobile and web push notifications for seamless user engagement.This integration will allow users to set up their webhooks to automatically trigger push notifications, reducing the need for custom development and enhancing the flexibility of the platform.
    

Validation & Opportunities:

-   Early Feedback: Discussions with 10+ projects in the Stellar ecosystem have revealed that most lack the resources to build such tools in-house.
    
-   Adoption Potential: A streamlined solution that reduces time-to-market for blockchain projects can attract a broad spectrum of users, from small startups to enterprise-level players.
    
-   Cross-Chain integration with top platforms and dApps : Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos (IBC) Polkadot, Arbitrum, Celo, Cardano, Uniswap, Aave, Curve. Finance, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Wormhole, AnySwap, Chainlink, Balancer
    

Challengers for developers and businesses:

-   Lack of Technical Resources : Many of these projects had small teams with limited technical expertise, particularly in backend development or API integration.
    
-   Time-Consuming Development Process : Teams were spending 1-2 weeks building webhook systems, testing integrations, and troubleshooting issues instead of focusing on core product development.
    
-   Scaling Challenges : Projects that had implemented basic webhook systems were struggling with scalability as transaction volumes grew, leading to server crashes, delays, and high maintenance costs. Handling custom web and mobile push notification.
    
-   Difficulty Tracking Custom Events : Every project had unique workflows and required custom event triggers that were difficult to implement with existing tools.
    
-   Non-Technical User Challenges : Non-developer stakeholders in projects couldn’t easily stay informed about on-chain events without constant developer support.
    
-   Limited Monitoring for Cross-Chain Activity : Projects working on cross-chain interoperability couldn’t find tools that provided real-time tracking of asset transfers across chains.
    
-   Inadequate Reporting and Analytics : Basic webhook implementations didn’t offer dashboards or analytics, making it hard for teams to analyze trends or troubleshoot issues.
    
-   High Maintenance Costs : Projects that had built custom webhook systems faced high maintenance costs, including server hosting, debugging, and scaling infrastructure.
    

Why Our solution is necessary when many of the offered features can be easily implemented by developers :

-   Time-Saving: Developers spend weeks or months setting up real-time event monitoring, webhook infrastructure, and cross-chain integrations.
    
-   Resource Optimization : Building these features requires dedicated server infrastructure, reliable APIs, custom error handling, and cross-chain expertise—demanding resources that many startups and teams don’t have.
    
-   Scalability : Custom implementations are often difficult to scale as user traffic grows or workflows become more complex.
    
-   Maintenance and Reliability: Maintaining a custom-built webhook system requires constant monitoring, debugging, and updates—a significant drain on resources.
    
-   Multi-Feature Integration: Developers must implement multiple independent features, such as transaction tracking, balance monitoring, and cross-chain operations, which require unique implementations for each.
    
-   Accessibility for Non-Tech Users : Non-technical product owners and business teams cannot easily interpret or act on raw data from APIs and blockchain transactions.
    
-   Focus on Stellar and Soroban Ecosystem : Generic webhook tools lack tailored support for Stellar/Soroban’s unique workflows and requirements.

","Summary of what we have built & learned

In our Q4 2023 submission we built our MVP and tested demand with one cash in option as well as USDC on Stellar and Bitcoin payments; this validated interest on the product, and showed we could improve easiness.

In our July 2024 submission we added cards and three more countries for cash in, and saw usage improve importantly. We also migrated from a marketplace format to an online store for merchants, and that brought us more than 200% increase in sales.

See our growth chart for signups and transactions here: https://imgur.com/a/jh9WBd6

THIS SUBMISSION WORKPLAN:

Increase usage 3-fold and volume 5-fold by adding local payments, which will open doors to greatly grow USDC exchange via p2p

1.  Add local cash in method in Venezuela: Pago Móvil
    
    We currently only accept payments from abroad, but after doing a pilot in one location, we realized local payments are highly desired by users and estimate that we will increase our transaction count at least 3x! This will enable us to serve 100% of their clients and not just the 10% who actually are using it now from international purchases. 
    
1.  Work with our legal partners in order complete the set up of our legal entities in Venezuela and finetune Mexico in order have a frictionless connection to banking systems 
    
    Set up an entity that is connected to the banking system and can allow us to launch our pago móvil collection scheme in Venezuela, and submit additional documentation to comply with local requirements in Mexico.
    
1.  Build exchange module base for Venezuelan fiat-USDC exchange
    
    After we are able to receive local fiat, we will exchange this into USDC in order to protect from inflation. In order to do this we will build and connect a rate information tool that will enable to know the exchange rate in an inflation economy in order to get accurate data for every time money is collected and exchanged to USDC via p2p systems and the official rate shared by central bank.",https://whimsical.com/un-alivio-november-submition-5qbeaQcPbwFgvXcFsWUiiN,"We define success by measuring growth on three simple key metrics, and our ONE KING KPI:

Fabian previously founded Glufco, a P2P and payments solution tailored to Venezuela with over 15,000 users. Ernesto spearheaded Dash initiatives in LatAm, onboarding chains like Church’s Chicken and Excelsior Gama to accept crypto.

Unalivio's go to market plan is now focused on two key approaches:  

1.  Online Payments for Brick-and-Mortar: Simplifying online payment acceptance for retailers who want to sell online but previously could not do it . We let them have a balance of USDC on Stellar to avoid inflation.
    
1.  International Payments: Enabling merchants to transact cross-border payments through Unalivio, which is something they could not do at all previously.
    

We onboarded about a dozen merchants on a one by one basis, and plan to double this before we deploy automatic tools.

We are iterating our product with laser focus before we expand, in order to avoid wasting resources.

As part of our merchant onboarding we will be testing the cross border scheme with a community in Mexico, involving incentivized brand ambassadors to sign up and promote usage.

We will continue in-store promotions, cashier training, point-of-sale materials, and social media efforts, particularly via Instagram with our 5,000 followers on  https://www.instagram.com/somosunalivio/.

Addressing Feedback from SCF31 Submission
---------------------------------------------

Following feedback from our SCF31 submission, the SocketFi team has implemented several improvements and changes:

Review of Project Budget and Scope

To address concerns regarding the project’s high budget and broad scope, we have adopted a streamlined approach to enhance focus and cost efficiency:

-   Clarified Objectives: SocketFi’s objectives were refined, prioritizing core goals and functionalities. Features have been categorized into essential, optional, and future enhancements. This allows us to focus on delivering critical functionalities first while deferring less urgent elements to later phases, simplifying development without compromising quality.
    
-   Optimized Budget: The budget was reassessed, itemizing all expenses and identifying high-cost areas. Cost-saving measures were adopted, including the use of open-source tools, existing frameworks, and outsourcing specific tasks.
    
-   Structured Development Process: A detailed roadmap, with clear deliverables, deadlines, and milestones, now structures the project, enabling efficient progress tracking.
    

These measures have successfully refined the project scope, optimized the budget, and established a focused, iterative development process, positioning the project for success.

SocketFi SDK and Enhanced User Experience

In response to feedback regarding the success dependency on the SocketFi dApp portal UI, we have expanded SocketFi into a service. With the development of the SocketFi SDK, a toolkit that allows Stellar-based projects to integrate the SocketFi wallet as a login option, users will be able to seamlessly connect to dApps through social login within the dApp's UI, significantly reducing reliance on the SocketFi portal for success.

Additionally, we have prioritized creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring an exceptional user experience with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.

To bolster user acquisition, we have implemented targeted strategies, including:

-   Partnerships within the Stellar ecosystem.
    
-   An incentivized community participation approach.
    
-   Engaging marketing campaigns.
    

These efforts will strengthen our user base and drive widespread adoption.

Ambitious ""Super App"" Vision with a Phased Rollout

While SocketFi is still in the development phase, positioning it as a ""super app"" is an ambitious goal. To achieve this, we have adopted a phased rollout strategy. Initially, we are focusing on core functionalities, including the SDK that allows dApps to independently integrate the SocketFi wallet. Over time, we will expand to include broader features, ultimately enabling users to access hundreds of dApps built on Soroban and Stellar from a unified platform.

Technical Clarification: Sending Funds Using Social Media Usernames

In the current version, users can send funds from accounts created with Twitter sign-in. However, they currently need to manually enter the recipient's wallet address. Future updates will enable fund transfers using usernames.

Our implementation utilizes an on-chain mapping system within the smart wallet that associates Twitter usernames (and other social platform identifiers) with Soroban smart contract addresses (smart accounts). This system ensures that when a user enters a recipient's Twitter handle (and other supported platform identifiers), it is securely mapped to the corresponding wallet address.

The mapping operates by storing username-address pairs in the main (controller) smart contract, which can be accessed through a smart contract function that securely resolves the username to its associated wallet address. To ensure security, only usernames linked to a smart accounts will be resolvable, protecting against impersonation and errors. More details on this implementation have also been included in our technical document.

Key Features and Benefits of SocketFi
-----------------------------------------

-   Convenience and Accessibility: Social media login streamlines account creation and access, eliminating the need for password management and encouraging broader adoption.
    
-   Enhanced Security: Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and encrypted sensitive data ensure secure account verification without exposing private information, protecting users from phishing and brute-force attacks.
    
-   Streamlined User Experience: New users benefit from a simple onboarding process, while returning users enjoy quick access without re-verification.

This makes it easier for users to find and interact with Stellar-based DeFi opportunities, improving accessibility for all experience levels.

AI Portfolio Builder: One Click’s AI will analyze user wallets, including Stellar-based assets, to recommend the best DeFi strategies. This helps users create portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and find yield opportunities within Stellar's ecosystem.

One-Click Zaps: This feature enables users to execute complex DeFi actions, like providing liquidity, on Stellar in one transaction. It simplifies cross-chain interactions and ensures that users can engage with Stellar-based DeFi pools effortlessly.

Gamified Yield Farming: One Click will introduce fun, interactive elements like automated airdrops and reward quests for Stellar-based DeFi. This engages users and encourages them to maximize returns on Stellar through a playful experience.

UPDATE since the previous SCF #30 submission of OneClick.Fi (Link to original submission: https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec83kMMeg4sWdkla)

Question 1: While the idea of earning yields from top protocols on other chains is interesting, it doesn’t appear to directly contribute to bringing liquidity into the Stellar ecosystem. Focusing on how to retain liquidity within Stellar or how the project can benefit Stellar-based protocols more clearly would help address this concern.  

Answer:

We will retain liquidity within Stellar and benefit Stellar-based protocols through the following products deployed by OneClick.Fi:

-   Yield Explorer - the frontend for exploring every DeFi pool on every protocol on Stellar network. Yield Explorer will directly showcase the yield pools of Stellar protocols, allow users to do their due diligence, and provide users simple access to the opportunities
    
-   Portfolio Builder - for users who don't know where to start in DeFi, they can use Portfolio Builder to create a customized/personalized portfolio of DeFi pools on Stellar. Newbie users use OneClick's Portfolio Builder and see the Stellar pools and protocols as the end result of their onboarding. This will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem
    
-   Airdrop Tracker + Stellar Spaces - we will create a dedicated ""Space"" for Stellar Ecosystem that will showcase the available protocols in Stellar Ecosystem, quests, giveaways, or other promotional campaigns available in the ecosystem. In the end, users will be able to see the ""Stellar Space"" with all the available campaigns and activities which will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem. 
    

You will find the links to demo of some of the features below as well as in the presentation.

  

And although OneClick.Fi delivers DeFi smoothness across a set of networks, additionally, the Stellar Network would be prioritized on the user interface in a variety of ways, for instance by:

-   Showing Stellar protocols and yield pools in the ""Featured"" section of Yield Explorer
    
-   Including Stellar opportunities as a one of the default options for the portfolio creation for Portfolio Builder
    
-   Putting Stellar Spaces in the front row / top of the UI for users to explore
    
-   Proactive banners and comparison of Stellar opportunities to other network opportunities
    
-   Etc. the exact details will be furnished
    
-   In addition to that, OneClick.Fi would partner with all the Stellar protocols/project (would need help from Stellar community with introductions) and organize educational campaigns to bring more awareness about the Stellar ecosystem. That would include:
    
-   Educational content (blog posts, threads, newsletters) about Stellar, protocols, and ecosystem around
    
-   AMAs with protocol founders/core team
    
-   Spaces, videos, podcasts with protocol founders/core team
    
-   ... And other activities that would bring more exposure to Stellar network. OneClick.Fi will essentially become Stellar's front page of DeFi as well as a global awareness machine with the goal of making people aware that there are cool things in Stellar DeFi and that it still exists (many crypto users don't even know that Stellar exists or is still alive after 2017-2018). We are here to change that in a simple, fun, and gamified way.
    

  

Question 2: Additionally, the deliverables are not well-organized, making it challenging to follow the development plan. A clearer breakdown of milestones and deliverables in a logical sequence would improve the proposal’s structure.

This project is a noncustodial Stellar wallet leveraging passkeys for enhanced security and ease of use. Freelii was originally built on Telegram and will be built on top of multiple socials as mini-apps to provide localized experiences to end users.,"Freelii is a re-branding and exploration on top of our original project - Strooper Wallet:

Strooper Github: https://github.com/JoseCToscano/strooper-wallet

Strooper Youtube Video: https://youtu.be/4faw_02YTBM

Freelii explores anchor integrations and Chatbot UX, but the key feature we want to focus on building prior to testnet is the Passkey login used in Strooper Wallet. We want to continue improving on this to make a ""one click"" verification.

We will combine the tech from Strooper and Freelii as we progress to mainnet.

Features and Stellar Integration:

1.  PassKeys for Secure Transactions (Strooper Technichal Architecture)  
    Stellar’s PassKeys enable secure transaction signing, making it easier and safer for users to manage their assets without dealing with private keys. Our main goal with these passkeys is to create a ""One Click Verification"" to create a frictionless experience.
    
1.  Peer-to-Peer Transfers (Freelii Technichal Architecture)  
    Users can scan a user’s address and send Stellar assets instantly within our wallet built on social platforms, offering fast, secure transfers directly in the chat.
    
1.  Anchor Integrations for On-Off Ramp (Freelii Technichal Architecture)  
    By integrating Stellar anchors, Strooper Wallet supports wallet top-ups and simple funds withdrawals, making it easier for users to move between crypto and traditional financial systems.
    

Impact of Improvements:

-   Security: PassKeys and Soroban smart contracts provide robust security and flexible asset management.
    

User Experience: Peer-to-peer transfers, customizable flows, and AI chatbot support enhance user convenience and streamline asset management.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1BsAcvzNs_WCv-Uta4chfI0ixqUKkX1/edit,"By the end of our first year, Freelii will aim to transact $250,000 a month. A comparable against an industry competitor. Where we want to win is sustained engagement with 50% active on a monthly basis. 

  

50,000 Users by end of year one. Why? A Fintech Monster like Revolut was able to attract 100,000 users in their first year of operations. For Freelii, 50,000 represents a balance between achievable growth and the need for user adoption in an increasingly competitive market. Coinbase and MetaMask saw significantly larger user growth rates after their first year but benefitted from being among the first in their categories.   

75% retention rate on onboarded customers. This benchmark is based on retention rates of successful wallets like MetaMask, which achieved similar retention rates due to strong product engagement.  

Impact:

Financial Inclusion: As more fiat users transition to crypto wallets, they gain access to global financial systems that were previously unavailable to them due to high fees, lack of infrastructure, or exclusion by traditional banks. For example, a user in a remote area could access savings, loans, and remittance services through Strooper without the need for a traditional bank account.",https://www.freelii.app/,https://github.com/JoseCToscano/freelii/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWXw0ZqOxlo,Yes,"Target Audience

Primary Market:

Viber Users: Viber is a widely-used messaging platform with millions of active users. In the Philippines it is estimated that 71% of Philippines population uses Viber worldwide. This is the fastest growing social platform - In 2021 the Viber traction was only 7%. We’ll focus on attracting existing Viber users who may have limited exposure to crypto but are interested in easy-to-use financial tools.

Primary Country Market: 

Targeting Philippines as our initial rollout country. In 2023, the Philippines received a record-breaking $37.2 billion in personal remittances, marking a 3.0% increase from $36.1 billion in 2022. Remittances account for over 8.5% of the countries GDP.

Secondary Market:

Stellar Community: The existing Stellar community will be a key early adopter group. We will actively engage with users already familiar with the Stellar ecosystem and Stellar-based DeFi tools.

Tertiary Market:

New DeFi Users: With the growing interest in decentralized finance, we will focus on users who are new to crypto and DeFi but are interested in simplified financial products like wallets, P2P transfers, and on-off ramp services.

Overall Market: 1.7 Billion underbanked people send hundreds of billions of dollars a year in unconventional ways, with 75% of payments being from outdated systems.

  

Value Proposition

Seamless Integration in Viber: No browser extensions, no separate app installations, just seamless access to Stellar's decentralised financial services for Viber users. 

Security and Simplicity: Leveraging PassKeys for secure transactions and removing the need for managing private keys will provide users with a safer, more user-friendly wallet experience. Low KYC needs.

Customizable and Automated: Our wallet offers customizable transaction flows through Soroban smart contracts, allowing users to automate asset management, bringing greater convenience to crypto transactions.

On-Off Ramp Services: By providing easy fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions through Stellar anchors, Freelii bridges the gap between traditional financial systems and crypto.

UX Focus: Creating social chatbots to help create familiarity to onboarding. Answer any questions pre-support needs, and help build comfort to any questions related to de-fi.

  

Acquisition channels:

  

Community Engagement

Stellar Ecosystem Partnerships: Collaborate with established Stellar-based projects and organizations to promote Strooper Wallet through joint campaigns and feature integrations.

Stellar Forums and Social Media: Engage with the Stellar community through Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, building excitement for the wallet’s launch.

  

Viber  User Base

Viber Ads and Bots: Leverage Viber’s advertising and bot ecosystem to run campaigns directly within the platform. Create demo bots for users to explore Freelii’s features before committing to use.

  

Influencer Marketing

Crypto Influencers: Engage crypto influencers to demo Freelii to their audiences. This includes both Stellar ecosystem influencers and those in the broader DeFi space.

Community-Led Referrals: Implement a referral program where users get rewards for inviting friends to join and use Freelii.

Tik Tok Micro influencing showing easy UX of telegram instant to Digital Wallet.

  

Organic Search and Content Marketing

Educational Content: Publish blog posts, explainer videos, and social media content around DeFi, crypto, and Stellar technology. 

  

SEO & Stellar-Related Keywords: Optimize our website and content for keywords related to Stellar, DeFi, and crypto wallets.

  

Events and Conferences: Continue to attend various conferences and build publicity and demo product to crypto users.

  

Launch Phases:

  

Phase 1: Beta Launch:

Launch on Testnet: Begin with a limited launch to select users in the Stellar community and Telegram crypto groups. We’ll gather feedback on usability, performance, and security. Incentivized Beta Testing Outreach: Giving XLM tokens or enrollment bonuses to early testers who provide feedback on the beta version. Also ensuring early users that we will eat any fees based on exclusive invite codes.

  

Based on product feedback we will enhance the AI chatbot to help with onboarding. Using it as a demo bot with step by step guides and reducing friction for future Production rollout.

  

We will use product feedback to create feature comparisons to other popular wallets looking to emphasise key differentiators such as Highlight Viber integration, PassKeys security, customizable transaction flows, ease of use, and advanced features such as customizable transaction flows using Soroban smart contracts.

  

Partnerships and integrations will be key in this stage. Freelii will always be looking to partner with Stellar anchors, DeFi platforms, and even non-Stellar applications to expand its capabilities. For instance, providing seamless fiat on-off ramps and advanced DeFi integration would offer a significant advantage over existing wallets. 

  

Joseph and Jose plan to work in Philippines beginning January. Joseph is well connected with many executives, which can help target the specific country by partnering with local wallets like GCash, or PayMaya, to provide seamless fiat-to-crypto on/off-ramp services. By offering a direct bridge between their wallets and Freelii, users can easily move between fiat (PHP) and crypto. Freelii could be promoted as the crypto extension of these fiat wallets. For instance, GCash and PayMaya already have integrations allowing users to purchase crypto. Freelii can position itself as a partner for Stellar-based remittances and decentralized finance (DeFi) features that these wallets don’t fully offer yet this can easily be done through a local exchange like Coins.PH or larger exchanges globally. Jose is also well connected with a Mexican Forex trader who wants to be one of the first mass adopters of Crypto. This partner has already stated client’s willingness to help bring these projects to mainstream in Mexico. Targeting particular countries will also be our key advantage in releasing our wallet.

  
  

Phase 2: Full Mainnet Launch

Target Date: April 2025

Marketing Push: Coordinated promotion through Viber ads, crypto influencer partnerships, and Stellar community announcements.

  

Referral Program Activation: Launch a referral program to encourage viral growth, allowing users to earn rewards for bringing in new users.

  

Stellar Community Airdrop: Airdrop an amount of XLM or other Stellar-based tokens to users who download Strooper and complete basic tasks (such as setting up their wallet or making their first peer-to-peer transfer). This incentivizes adoption and builds immediate engagement within the Stellar community.

  

Referral-Based Airdrops: Reward users who refer others with airdropped tokens once their referrals onboard and complete specific tasks (like making a transaction). Both the referrer and the referred user receives incentives. This dual-sided approach helps break down psychological barriers to trying a new service and results in organic user acquisition. 

  

Partnerships: Utilise partnerships made in the Beta phase to help support our lunch and collaborate marketing pieces to build traction.

  
  

Phase 3: Post-Launch Growth

Stellar DeFi Integration: Continue building partnerships with Stellar-based DeFi projects and anchors to expand Strooper Wallet’s feature set and user base.

  

Ongoing Product Iteration: Based on user feedback, we’ll release regular updates with new features, such as advanced automation and expanded asset support.

  

Customer Support and Retention:

AI Chatbot: Based on user feedback continue to enhance our AI chatbot to offer 24/7 in-app support for users, improving user retention and satisfaction.

Customer Feedback Loop: Implement an ongoing feedback system, conducting user surveys and engaging with the community to ensure the wallet evolves with their needs.","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KyAneWvA5Fo5OKektQUDfhoVJ2jI-P0oJGulxK3cEGU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

  

User Engagement: Strooper Wallet, Freelii’s prototype, achieved 47 enrollments within just three days of showcasing, demonstrating a strong initial interest and product-market fit.

**Development costs:  
**Our main short-term focus is improving this capability to create a ""one-click"" onboarding experience with Stellar’s PassKeys, which is a complex and resource-intensive process due to the following challenges:

1.  Custom Smart Contracts:  
    We need to design and deploy custom contracts to manage PassKeys, integrate ""C"" and ""G"" addresses, and support our seamless onboarding flow. These contracts will require audits to ensure security, which adds to the cost.
    
1.  Rigorous Testing:  
    Extensive unit testing is needed to ensure every part of the system—from PassKey generation to transaction signing—works reliably and securely, especially when handling financial transactions.
    
1.  Policy Signer Integration:  
    Developing support for custom policy signers is critical to connect ""C"" and ""G"" addresses. This also requires building indexing systems to track and manage accounts efficiently, adding development effort.
    
1.  WebAuth and MiniApp Limitations:  
    Current webviews, like those in Telegram MiniApps, don’t natively support PassKeys. We’ll need to create custom flows to manage PassKeys and signing while ensuring a smooth user experience.
    
1.  PassKey Management:  
    Managing PassKeys within the MiniApp environment requires developing secure and scalable solutions that align with the platform’s limitations. Stellar’s PassKeys enable secure transaction signing, making it easier and safer for users to manage their assets without dealing with private keys.
    

These tasks demand significant development time, expertise, and resources, including the cost of testing, and building new features. This investment is essential to create a seamless onboarding experience that is secure, scalable, and easy to use.

1.  API Integration Costs:  
    Integrating with Stellar’s ecosystem requires building robust API connections to support remittance flows. This involves working with SEPs like SEP-10, SEP-12, SEP-6, and SEP-24 for authentication, KYC, deposits, and withdrawals. Each API integration requires development time, testing, and ongoing maintenance to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, integrating with anchors, initially Circle’s USDc and additional partners for fiat on/off-ramping will involve negotiation and potential usage fees, especially for scaling in the Philippines.
    
1.  Backend Development:  
    The backend must be robust and scalable to handle transaction generation, PassKey management, and policy signer integration while ensuring high availability and security. Building this infrastructure will require substantial development time, audits, and server hosting costs, as well as ongoing maintenance and updates.
    

Pivoting to Viber ($2K):  
We originally built Freelii on Telegram, but to better reach our first target market, the Philippines, we are pivoting to Viber for the MVP. Viber’s significantly higher adoption in the Philippines aligns with our target customer base, offering greater potential for user engagement and retention. However, this shift comes with added costs:

-   Viber Integration Costs: Adapting our chatbot and backend infrastructure to work with Viber’s APIs and platform-specific requirements.
    
-   Licensing and Operational Fees: Viber’s platform usage may incur recurring fees, particularly for advanced integrations and enterprise features.
    
-   Localization: Customizing the chatbot UX for cultural and linguistic relevance to the Philippines, including translations, local regulations, and market preferences.
    

Despite these additional costs, the move to Viber will allow us to focus directly on our target customers, providing a more impactful and tailored experience. By prioritizing user engagement in a high-potential market, we aim to maximize early adoption and validate our product more effectively.

Anchor Integrations for On-Off Ramp (Want minimum two anchors before publication to Testnet) ($10K)

Costs Breakdown:

Costs for Anchor Integrations for On/Off Ramp (Target: Minimum Two Anchors, $10K)

1.  Business Accounts + Verifications:  
    Setting up verified business accounts for anchors includes legal fees, registration, and compliance checks like KYC reviews. Estimated cost: $2K-$3K.
    
1.  Setup & Configuration:  
    Anchor-specific setup requires account configuration, secure API key management, and testing. Estimated cost: $1K-$2K.
    
1.  API Integrations:  
    Developing secure API connections for deposits, withdrawals, and compliance with SEPs (e.g., SEP-6, SEP-24) requires thorough testing and optimization. Estimated cost: $2K-$3K.
    
1.  Development:  
    Building backend modules for fiat on/off-ramping and transaction tracking, plus ongoing maintenance. Estimated cost: $3K-$4K.
    
    We have been in discussion with various partners for on/off ramps:
    

Our initial rollout will include the USDC Access (By Circle), and Stripe Connect for On-Ramps. For Off-Ramps, we are focused on integrating with [](http://coins.ph)Coins.PH who will enable digital wallets - GCash and Pay Maya payouts. Our second off-ramp focus will be on Bank deposits VIA InstaPay and PESONet.

Other ramps post MVP:

On-Ramps: Moneygram VIA Stellar, Stripe Connect, Moonpay, ACH Transfers (Via Circle), Enrolled in USDC Access Beta (Circe), Bitso (For eventual expansion to Latam).

Off Ramps (Philippines specific): Moneygram VIA Stellar, Gcash, PayMaya, Coins.PH, Bank deposits VIA Instapay and PESONet, also speaking with Union Bank who is a leading digital supporting bank in the Philippines.","Cost Breakdown: $20K (February - March)

Our TestNet development phase will prioritize features based on user feedback, focusing on delivering key functionalities while addressing technical challenges to ensure scalability and user satisfaction.

1.  **Soroban Smart Contracts ($10K):  
    **Developing Soroban Smart Contracts will enable customizable transaction flows and automation, providing greater flexibility in asset management. However, Smart Contracts on Stellar do not inherently track balances for any asset. Instead, we must specify which assets to monitor and perform inverse searches for each asset, requiring indexing solutions to gather and display data effectively. Implementing this indexing system adds significant complexity and development costs.
    
1.  **Asset Management ($5K):  
    **Providing users with the ability to view and manage their Stellar assets will involve building intuitive interfaces and backend support. Offering decentralized savings accounts through tools like (Script3) Blend introduces additional value, allowing users to earn interest. However, these features require compliance with decentralized finance protocols, as well as development efforts to ensure seamless integration and user experience.
    

Key Technical Considerations and Costs:

-   Indexing Challenges: Building or integrating an indexing system for asset tracking is critical. Without it, Smart Contracts cannot natively display balances, requiring expensive backend development or third-party indexing services to handle this.
    
-   Smart Contracts: Ensuring the security and reliability of Soroban Smart Contracts adds further costs through audits and rigorous testing.
    
-   Custom Integrations: Both DEX and Oracle integrations require tailored development, testing, and maintenance.
    

  

Audit (Free): Will use Stellar Launchkit and apply for credits for Audit. Already in contact with Andreas Mantzoutas, who is already looking to help us start on the technical side and future audit.

Legal Incorporation ($2K): Setting up Delaware LLC, state fees, registered agent services for the first year, virtual address in the US, and operating agreement. Legal adjustments to operating agreement for our specific business such as: Non-Custodial Wallets: Clearly state that Freelii is a technology provider and does not hold or manage user funds, avoiding regulatory misclassification.Crypto Transactions: Include clauses limiting liability and emphasizing compliance to address regulatory grey areas. Cross-Border Transfers: Define how disputes across jurisdictions are handled and ensure compliance with international regulations.","Support and Maintenance ($10K):

Set up user support infrastructure, including ticketing systems. Ongoing maintenance to platform.

Monitoring and Analytics Tools ($1K/Month + $1K Development Fees): Deploy real-time monitoring for transactions and user behavior (e.g., DataDog, Grafana).

Operational Liquidity ($5-10K Reserve Based on Volume):

As non-Custodial, fund flows will need to hold “collateral”. This will allow negative revenue accounts so payouts can be authenticated before the pay-in is captured so we never hold the customer’s cash. Establish liquidity pools to handle transaction mismatches (e.g., refunds, chargebacks).

Infrastructure and Hosting ($1K/Month + $1K Development Fees):

Ensure reliable hosting for mainnet operations, including full nodes, APIs, and failover systems.

Stellar Transaction Fees Reserve ($1-5K Based on Volume):

Maintain reserves to cover operational fees for a defined number of transactions.","Joseph Anthony, Jose Toscano",gkqjdoivvhcsfylol3yy.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1758463200000/H9SsM2nKYChbUQ9ihtqRBw/NY4zdsqeTYNTGPyGqsGqkiqIiczEiKELG2bn7sR8VGDy239NjETCqgQ8tZKMo6SYAnlPdjOo57yrRwKn7R6tTef0DL7xKWovFEa_ficSTahG77xeLE6HmnDpFvOnKPN8EIfcbp9XDQCamhr1syeKnA/ChbtNeREoq50PvgE_D2uM3e0UErJDGOUjwNRpjMM4Pk),https://www.linkedin.com/company/freelii/,,,

It takes a strategic long-term maintenance approach of automating updates where possible, without compromising on allowing the community to extend the project with manual updates.  
  
It also offers the strong possibility of being able to extend the automatically produced SDK output into native binaries for all the major platforms and CPU architectures, by offering gRPC or protobuf specs. If this aspect of the project is successful, then it means this lightweight Soroban SDK can be available permanently for any platform with manual maintenance software development.  
  
Furthermore, the toolkit will include working boilerplate apps allowing Smart TV , Mobile and other developers to get up and running with Stellar integrated games and apps with no learning curve.

All the deliverables are technical artifacts. Estimated dates of completion are provide in weeks from award confirmation.  
  
#### Deliverable 1: A tool to generate source and automate SDK updates  
Brief Description  
This tool or set of tools includes: a custom OpenRPC -> C# class and client generator generating the entities specified need for comms with the Soroban RPC server; a modification to XDRGEN to emit 'partial' C# classes; a main tool that orchestrates the OpenRPC and XDR Generators to produce outputs, modify them further, and emit the code-generated part of the SDK. In addition, as described in 'How to measure completion,' a test suite will need to be produced (though more tests come later in other deliverables).  
  
How to measure completion  
OpenRPC Soroban RPC specs, XDR specs, and additional metadata generate source that can be included in a simple Console app to communicate with a Soroban RPC instance successfully. This can be determined using the ""examples"" section of the Soroban RPC spec, along with XDR serialisation and deserialisation between the XDR generated classes in the SDK and the strings in the examples.  
  
Estimated date of completion  
T+3 weeks.  
  
Budget  
7000 USD

Brief Description  
This adds the various utility methods and classes into the SDK, such as for signing, allowing Soroban authorisation, helpers to get the account balances and other details described in the technical documentation. The test suite will be extended.  
  
How to measure completion  
Clearly defined tests will pass. The output NuGet package will be added to a simple console app demonstrating some basic scenarios, such as Account funding. (The app is extended to become a full artifact in later deliverables).  
  
Estimated date of completion  
T+5 weeks.  
  
Budget  
2000 USD  
  
#### Deliverable 3: A build variant specifically for Unity  
Brief Description  
IL Weaving will be applied to internalise any dependent assemblies into the main SDK library, while a new build configuration will output a Unity specific DLL. Code generators from Deliverable 1 will be extended to add compile time switches to expose Unity Editor metadata for the Unity build. A simple Unity boilerplate empty game project will be produced that demonstrates some of the intended scenarios such as interacting with a Soroban contract and funding an Account.

#### Deliverable 4: Boilerplate Applications  
Brief Description  
Boilerplate, skeleton apps for Smart TV, .NET Android , iOS, Windows , Linux (cross platform native), will be produced in full to allow anyone interested in these platforms to simply download the source, compile, run and already be on Stellar. The test app from the Unity deliverable will also be polished. These will all be published as sub projects in the main repo.

#### Deliverable 6: Attempted universal SDK  
Brief Description  
This is an attempt at modifying the client generator to add a second interface that would allow users to either supply an HTTP client or some kind of in memory channel (possibly gRPC), adding a protobuf / gRPC spec file so that clients can generate their own classes in their own language, and the build output to generate precompiled optimised native binaries for all common platforms and CPU architectures. Initial research looks promising. If this works, then the SDK becomes even more generally useful as a universal Soroban SDK that is automatically maintained and offers protobuf to interface with it.

#### Deliverable 7: Documentation and mainnet finalisation  
Brief Description  
Further documentation will be added to the project repo clarifying the build process, how to maintain, explaining how to test, and enhancing the boilerplate app guidance. A test contract can be deployed to mainnet if necessary and the test console app run against it.  
  
Also - all licensing for all works will be open source.  
  
How to measure completion  
Documentation seems sufficient, readable, and the end to end test app works on a mainnet contract. License on everything is MIT or whatever Stellar Community / Foundation prefers, as long as the SDK outputs or binaries do not mandate that derivative works are open source.

Having launched on Testnet, we now aim to improve our contracts, transition to Mainnet, and leverage Keepers to rescue funds if a strategy becomes unhealthy. Wallet providers will also be able to earn fees from the yield generated on deposited funds.

Our strategies utilize existing DeFi protocols on Soroban, such as auto-compounding with Blend, where USDC is supplied, BLND rewards are swapped for USDC, and reinvested. To enhance these strategies, we will refine our contracts, collaborate with an audit company (funded by the Audit Bank), and prepare for Mainnet deployment.

To secure user funds, we will develop Keepers using Mercury’s infrastructure, integrating Zephyr Programs for metrics and automation tools for execution. These tools will enable wallet providers to automate fund rescues for risky strategies and gather metrics for informed rebalancing.

Additionally, we plan to enhance the user experience for creating vaults, ensuring a seamless and intuitive design that simplifies onboarding and platform interaction.

By addressing the specific needs of freelancers, businesses, and everyday crypto users, Eascrow on Stellar aims to revolutionize escrow services with fast, secure, and low-cost blockchain solutions.","While Eascrow is still in the early stages of development, we have already conducted several validation activities that demonstrate strong interest and potential adoption of our platform within the Stellar ecosystem and beyond.

1) User Surveys

In March 2024, we conducted a survey among 500 freelancers and small businesses across Europe and Latin America. The results indicated that 68% of respondents were dissatisfied with their current payment options for cross-border transactions, citing high fees (average of 7% per transaction) and long processing times (2-5 business days). Additionally, 75% expressed interest in an escrow service that guarantees security and faster payments using blockchain technology.

2) User Interviews and Feedback

We conducted over 30 in-depth interviews with freelancers, small business owners, and crypto users. These interviews highlighted a consistent demand for more transparent and secure transaction methods. Key pain points included fear of non-payment or service delivery failures in freelance agreements, particularly in emerging markets. Over 80% of interviewees mentioned that they would be willing to try a blockchain-based escrow service if it could address these issues. This feedback directly aligns with the core functionality that Eascrow offers, providing both sides of a transaction with increased security and trust.

3) Initial Interest from Ecosystem Projects

We have also reached out to several projects within the Stellar ecosystem, including decentralized marketplaces and digital payment platforms. Two projects expressed interest in potentially integrating Eascrow’s services to enhance transaction security for their users. While these are preliminary discussions, they indicate a strong alignment between Eascrow’s offerings and the needs of other ecosystem players.

These early traction points demonstrate that there is significant market demand for a secure, blockchain-based escrow service, particularly for freelancers and businesses dealing with cross-border transactions. As we move towards the beta launch, we expect to solidify these initial interests and convert them into active platform users. Moreover, as soon as the Eascrow initial development is done, we will build our first Eascrow native product: Linqt, the first web3 freelance marketplace on Stellar.","I) Steps for our MVP : ✅

The mainnet launch will be accompanied by press releases, partner announcements, and Stellar community events to maximize visibility. Post-launch, Hermes will focus on user acquisition through liquidity incentives, referral programs, and educational resources, making the platform accessible to both experienced traders and newcomers. Continuous engagement will be driven by regular updates, trading competitions, and governance activities to maintain user interest and participation.","1. Industry Demand:  

   Perpetual exchanges are one of the fastest-growing sectors in decentralized finance (DeFi), with leading platforms like Jupiter, Hyperliquid, and GMX achieving billions in trading volume. This validates the widespread demand for decentralized derivatives trading. By bringing perpetuals to Stellar, we can tap into an established market while addressing gaps in Stellar's current ecosystem.

  

2. User Interest:  

   The popularity of perpetual exchanges lies in their ability to offer leverage trading, hedge risks, and access diverse assets—all of which attract a broad spectrum of traders. Integrating a perpetual exchange on Stellar provides an opportunity to onboard users from traditional perpetual platforms and expand Stellar's user base into a lucrative market segment.

  

3. On-Chain Metrics from Leading Platforms:  

   - Platforms like Hyperliquid and Jupiter consistently process over $1 billion in daily trading volume.

   - HyperLiquid and the top perpetual exchange have proven that decentralized perpetuals can achieve deep liquidity, attracting both institutional and retail users.

4. Current Gap on Stellar:  

   Stellar currently excels in payments and tokenized assets but lacks advanced trading infrastructures for leverage trading and other advanced derivatives. Adding this feature could fill a key gap, increasing Stellar’s competitiveness and expanding its appeal beyond remittances to DeFi-native users.

  

Justification for Meeting SCF Build Award Criteria

  

- Traction in the Market: The proven success of perpetual exchanges in the broader DeFi market highlights their scalability and user appeal. Introducing this functionality to Stellar could open new doors for user acquisition and ecosystem growth.

- Validation: The success of competitors validates the model, and bringing perpetual exchanges to Stellar offers a unique value proposition: leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions to make perpetuals more accessible and efficient.","-   The current version of Hermes was initially developed during two hackathons, HackMeridian and Dev.to, as a proof of concept for the platform's vision. While it demonstrates the fundamental functionality, it lacks several critical features and remains relatively centralized due to the time constraints of hackathon development. The codebase is publicly available, providing a starting point for further iteration. To transition Hermes into a fully operational MVP, we plan to:
    
    -   Implement support for multiple positions to allow users more flexibility in their trading strategies.
        
    -   Add functionality to support multiple tokens within pools and the ability to create multiple pools, enhancing the platform's scalability and token interoperability.
        
    -   Refactor and fix specific function calls and parameters to ensure smooth execution of all key operations.
        
-   The MVP will be considered complete when the following milestones are achieved:
    
    -   Feature Validation: Successfully supporting multiple positions and multiple token types in pools across several live test cases. Multiple pools functioning concurrently without errors, with seamless interaction for users.
        
    -   Decentralization Progress: Demonstrable steps toward decentralization, such as integrating more Stellar-based smart contracts and reducing reliance on centralized elements.

Identity Operating System (idOS),SCF #31,Implementing a self-custodial and compliant identity layer on Stellar,Identity Operating System (idOS),Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recFctBzb2Zo3VO4z,Awarded,33,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$125000.00,$41666.67,100272.49,,Build,Implement the idOS on Stellar to unlock KYC-reusability even for obligated entities and user-owned data management,"The idOS is a decentralized identity and storage layer. It gives users the ability to be in control of their own data and dApps to make even KYC onboarding as smooth as signing a transaction.  
  
The idOS is a network of nodes that stores user-encrypted data and uses a proof-of-state consensus to enforce user request. Unlike P2P decentralized storage providers, it allows for data privacy ( e.g. GDPR) compliance.  
  
In a world that finally sees self-custodial rails being used in the real world, especially for finance application, the idOS bridges identity user information over from one dApp and use case to another.  
  
Imagine investing on a RWA platform and later wanting to offer this stake on an institutional DEX pool. Usually both cases would require a full KYC process. The idOS allows both entities to exchange this information with the consent of the user. Imagine, having a wallet that acts both as a bank account as well as a hub for various financial dApps: These use cases need an identity orchestration layer that the idOS provides.  
  
The integration can be separated in three steps that finish with an implementation of the idOS into Stellar:

1.  General implementation and system operability, specifically PPKP interoperability and message-signing recognition
    
1.  SEP-10 support and native wallet support
    
1.  SEP-12 integration to allow wallet --> Anchor or wallet --> dApp flows
    

  
The integration would allow a native and user-self-custodial passing of KYC information. It would e.g. allow Vibrant to connect to the idOS to securely store KYC information and enable user data management as well as KYC passing. It does not enable an attestation system for smart contract native identity gating use cases.",https://docs.idos.network/idos-docs/how-it-works/system-architecture,"1.  Technical implementation and readiness (the product is implemented and can be used)
    
1.  Number of data consumers (we have at least 3 dApps that actively use the idOS)
    
1.  Number of users (undefined)",https://idos.network,https://github.com/idos-network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ZtdDg0N7n4Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","We are identifying use collaboration use cases that require an orchestration layer for decentralized identity: That could e.g. be a Vibrant integration to unlock the use case in general, but would ideally be in combination with other obligated entities that are used in the same frontend.  
  
This could be  

1.  Consumer focused applications like e.g. Vibrant implementing self-custodial debit card providers like Kulipa, crypto-to-fiat remittance companies and bank account features like e.g. Monerium offers in one dApp.
    
1.  RWA value chain cases like the Tokenization provider that is auctioning off an asset passing on the KYC information to a permissioned DEX that allows institutional investors to provide liquidity and a lending marketplace using the asset as collateral for a crypto-to-fiat payout. These providers could implement the idOS to avoid having to each KYC the user.
    
1.  Compliant financial transaction privacy: Having a clean pool of KYCed users allows data privacy in a compliant way as transactions can be obfuscated without violating AML laws.
    

We place special attention to making sure that we only deploy in ecosystems where we see a good path towards adoption. The idOS only works when people and dApps sign up for it which is why it is important to us to ensure adoption and usage.","The idOS is the first identity protocol to gather significant support for creating a joint standard to store, manage and exchange user data: The idOS is a consortium that Arbitrum Foundation, Circle (through its affiliate Circle Ventures), Ripple, NEAR Foundation, Gnosis, Aleph Zero Foundation, Radix and the Tezos Foundation (Etherlink) joined.  
The idOS is specifically relevant for real world financial use cases as it unlocks KYC-reusability and self-custodial data management that is data privacy compliant. The idOS is currently live on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum having processed over 2.500 users. We are currently working on bringing the idOS live with obligated entities providing services via our consortium partners and potentially Stellar.","Tranche 1: basic Stellar support

Soroban Resource Usage Reporter is designed to meet the specific needs of developers working within the Soroban ecosystem. In the coding and testing phases, this tool enables developers to efficiently track resource usage through key metrics, much like Hardhat Gas Reporter helps Ethereum developers streamline contract efficiency. By offering insights into these metrics, developers are empowered to write more efficient and cost-effective smart contracts from the very start.

For Stellar, this tool can help drive adoption and best practices within the ecosystem. By providing developers with early-stage resource usage tracking and optimization suggestions, Stellar can foster a community that is conscious of resource efficiency, which is crucial for maintaining scalability and cost-effectiveness across the network.

Additionally, as developers refine their contracts with the help of our Resource Usage Reporter, this can lead to better overall performance and lower transaction costs on the Stellar chain, contributing to Stellar’s long-term success.

Goal

We propose to develop a Node.js-based Resource Usage Reporter tool specifically for Stellar, designed to offer developers detailed insights into resource consumption metrics during their coding and testing cycles. The primary aim is to enable developers to track key data points, such as execution frequency and resource fee, and receive basic suggestions for improving efficiency.

Looking ahead, while our current focus is on optimizing development workflows through essential resource tracking, we aim to expand the tool’s functionality to further support the Soroban ecosystem as it grows. This will reinforce Stellar’s commitment to developer support and network sustainability, with an emphasis on enhancing workflows and contributing to the chain’s long term performance and scalability.

Considering resource limitations, the resource usage reporter will assist developers in optimizing their smart contract code by highlighting cost variations in contract function calls under constrained resources, as well as displaying function call runtimes. The insights provided in the generated table will guide developers in reducing resource consumption, managing fee limitations, and improving the speed of contract function execution.

That's why the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) started defining standards for wallets and anchors very early on to facilitate their interoperability and to maximize the adoption.

The basic consideration here is that, from the wallet developer's point of view, it should make no difference whether they integrate with one anchor or with several different ones. The power of this interoperability standard is that you code once and ideally with very little modifications you can support multiple companies and you can provide a very competitive service in terms of your wallet offering.

However, because these standards were defined very early on to maximize adoption, with very little information about the most important user cases, the consequence was that they had to be extended again and again over the last 10 years to reflect the wallet and anchor builder’s needs. But evolving the standard is not an easy thing, you don’t want to break anyone who is already compatible, so you need to create this backwards compatible evolution system that ends up becoming almost like a patchwork where you either grow by having a fixed set of endpoints with a lot of optional parameters or you have a bunch of endpoints that do slightly different things. It is probably impossible to get as close to a good API as if you had defined that from the go considering all the use cases and accommodated all of them. As a result, these standards have become very complex, extensive, and interconnected over time. See for example SEP-06 or SEP-24.

The standard API for interoperability between wallets and anchors was defined by SDF via so-called Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs). And the original recommendation for developers to become interoperable was to read the SEPs and implement them. However, since these are very complex, extensive and cover many edge cases, this led to many different interpretations during implementation.

That's why SDF came up with the idea of implementing so-called Wallet SDKs about two years ago. These are software libraries that implement the needed functionality and that developers can integrate into their program, so as not to keep reinventing the wheel over and over again.

The integration of a wallet SDK makes it very easy for the developer of a client application to become interoperable. They do not have to develop the communication with the anchor themselves, but only use the SDK. Furthermore, this helps to remain interoperable, because every time the standard evolves, a new version of the SDK is also released, and the developer only must update to use the new version of the library. It is a common, natural process for software developers. And, because the functionality is already implemented, developers can become interoperable much faster and at a much lower cost than if they were to implement the functionality from scratch themselves. This means that developers have more time to focus on implementing their business logic instead of constantly reinventing the wheel by having to implement Stellar details.

Wallet SDKs are currently offered for three different programming languages. The Stellar Development Foundation created and maintained the TypeScript and the Kotlin Wallet SDKs. And the Flutter (dart) Wallet SDK was developed and is maintained by me (Soneso). You can find their documentation on the official Stellar docs website under: Build a Wallet with the Wallet SDK.

All three SDKs offer the same functionality and the same interfaces for integration. These were defined by SDF when the TypeScript and Kotlin SDKs were implemented.

The new Swift Wallet SDK will implement all the current features of the other SDKs from the Wallet SDK family (Stellar Integration, SEP-01, SEP-10, SEP-09, SEP-12, SEP-24, SEP-06, SEP-38, SEP-30, SEP-07). As soon as new features are defined and implemented by SDF, the Swift Wallet SDK will grow with them. Like the other Wallet SDKs, the Swift Wallet SDK will be build upon the corresponding Horizon SDK, the Horizon iOS Stellar SDK, of which I am the main developer and maintainer.

If you are interested in learning more about the importance and usability of the Wallet SDKs, please check out this Meridian presentation by Alex Cordeiro (Senior Director, Engineering, SDF).",https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/architecture.pdf,The SDK makes it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products.,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk,https://youtu.be/YjmWVLasTYk,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","The SDK will be listed on the official Stellar Wallet SDK Page and on the Stellar Wallet SDK docs page. Furthermore, a new section will be created for the SDK in the official Stellar Discord Channel sdk-hub, where I will be available to developers for their questions and help them with the integration.","Because the Swift Wallet SDK is a new project, I can only provide evidence of prior traction or validation via the Horizon iOS Stellar SDK, on which the Swift Wallet SDK will be build upon. The open-source Horizon iOS Stellar SDK is used by many projects including the Lobstr Wallet and has more than 100 stars on GitHub. It has also won the Stellar Build Challenge #6.

SiBorg,SCF #31,SiBorg: The Future of Sponsorship through Tokenized Advertising Spaces,SiBorg,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec7DMQ1TCxcapjR3,Awarded,33,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$95900.00,$63933.34,193946.92,5/29/2025,Build,"SiBorg is developing an on-chain sponsorship protocol that tokenizes advertising spaces across websites, newsletters, and Telegram channels. This enables sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers while creating a new asset class. SiBorg will integrate its existing system with Stellar's Soroban to leverage scalable architecture and efficient on/off-ramping solutions.","What SiBorg Is 
SiBorg is building a decentralized monetization protocol, transforming the visibility of media and creators into a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across multiple interfaces. This allows buyers to speculate on the future growth of publishers.

The Problem
There are no Web3-native sponsorship solutions. Apps and publishers have to rely on off-chain (and often opaque) methods to generate revenue from sponsors. While we are seeing more decentralized tools for the creator economy (e.g., Lens, Paragraph), current approaches to generating revenue still rely on traditional business models (gifts, subsriptions, advertising), which don’t leverage tokenization opportunities. As a result, one cannot invest in the growth of a media outlet, creator, or app's visibility, they can only spend advertising budgets, stuck in a KPI-centric model.
The Solution
We are creating an on-chain sponsorship protocol that introduces a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across websites, newsletters, and Telegram channels. This asset class transforms visibility into a tradable financial instrument, allowing sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers, such as media outlets. Our solution builds trust and strengthens reputations by aligning the interests of sponsors, now seen as investors, with those of publishers. Publishers retain full control over the content displayed, preventing scammy ads from appearing. This also creates an additional revenue stream for publishers, who receive upfront payments and earn royalties from secondary market transactions. Publishers can join our marketplace to create tokenized offers for their ad spaces. Sponsors can then purchase these spaces and submit advertising proposals for publisher approval. Sponsors also benefit from a secondary market, where they can resell ad spaces or, in the future, even use them as collateral for loans.

How It Works and Its Use of Soroban
We’ve already launched a first version on Base (EVM). Now, we’re planning to deploy on the Stellar network using Soroban to take advantage of the scalable architecture and seamless global on and off-ramping capabilities.
- “DSponsor” Smart Contracts (permissionless)
    - These contracts handle the tokenization of ad spaces, turning visibility (like digital website parcels) into assets that can be traded.
    - They also include DeFi and marketplace logic, as well as handlers for ad submission (on the sponsor side) and validation (on the publisher side). Important to note: The contracts store only data hashes, while actual files (such as logos) are stored on decentralized storage platforms like IPFS.
- “App” Frontend 
    - The frontend allows both sponsors and publishers to interact with smart contracts, enabling features like login functionality, handling payments for tokenized ad spaces, and administration tools for managing ad campaigns.
    - With a focus on user experience, the app is designed to operate without requiring any Web3 knowledge, ensuring ease of use with minimal transaction fees, near-instant settlements, and smooth on-ramping.
-  “Relayer” API & SDK
- GraphQL and REST APIs, along with SDKs in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust, serve information from smart contract events to the frontend.
- This system allows any publisher (creators, dApps, media outlets) to automatically integrate validated ads into their platforms, including websites, newsletters, Telegram channels, with more platforms to come.

Cede Labs,SCF #31,Cede Labs: Unlocking liquidity between CeFi and DeFi effortlessly,Cede Labs,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recP8ThGTCNqAQIj6,Awarded,33,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$119800.00,$79866.66,247446.34,5/30/2025,Build,"Cede Labs specializes in bridging the gap between Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by offering seamless, secure connectivity to over 15 Centralized Exchange (CEX) APIs. Our innovative solutions unlock liquidity from CEXs, enabling effortless integration for dApps and asset managers to optimize their operations without compromising user experience.","The Problem:
CEX connectivity presents significant challenges due to the tremendous lack of fluidity between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This disconnection prevents the seamless transfer of liquidity, with over 40% of crypto liquidity trapped in centralized exchanges, limiting the potential for DeFi innovation and broader ecosystems like Stellar. Moreover, existing liquidity gateway solutions are inefficient, expensive, or not user-friendly (FIAT on-ramp, Bridges, …); with CEX integration being highly complex, especially for Web3 teams whose core expertise lies elsewhere. Adding to the difficulty, the maintenance of CEX API keys requires heavy ressources and continuous monitoring. 

The Solution:
To bridge the gap between CeFi & DeFi, Cede Labs is building two products: 

- Cede.store:
To answer to a demand of DeFi & blockchain builders to bring more liquidity into their products (dApps, wallets, …) in a simple way without spending money or development time, Cede Labs built cede.store. 
Cede.store is a non-custodial browser extension to store CEX (centralized exchanges) API keys and to sign CEX requests from the client-side. Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets with a familiar UX and DX as DeFi wallets (e.g. Metamask).
Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets. In that way, we offer the dApp a way to track and manage a user's CEX assets while staying non-custodial and keeping the same UX as any DeFi browser wallet.

To integrate cede.store into a dApp, similar to how a DeFi wallet functions, the dApp interacts with a provider object (e.g., `window.ethereum` for EVM wallets or `window.cede` for cede.store). The dApp can execute various methods, such as retrieving balances or initiating a withdrawal from the exchange to the blockchain.

If a project prefers not to interact directly with this API, they can utilize our widget, which facilitates the transfer of funds from a CEX to the user’s address. For a list of all our partners, visit https://cede.store/partners.


- Cede SDK:
For more advanced integrations and white-label needs, builders can opt to use our Cede SDK. This solution offers deeper customization of CEX connectivity, allowing developers to store CEX API keys wherever they see fit, ensure mobile compatibility, and bypass the need for the cede.store browser extension.
Currently, Cede SDK is a CEX connectivity SDK helping custody providers and custodians fast-forward their CEX integrations for asset management. 
Basically: Fireblocks’ CEX connectivity as a service.

Stellar Integration & Soroban: As part of our broader strategy, Cede Labs is working to integrate the Stellar blockchain into its API and SDK. This will allow Stellar-based dApps to access liquidity from centralized exchanges, greatly expanding Stellar’s utility. Soroban, Stellar’s smart contract engine, will be instrumental in this integration, particularly through the introduction of an ""Instant Protocol Deposit"" feature. This feature will enable users to seamlessly transfer assets from CEXs directly into Stellar-based protocols, such as DeFi applications, without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging Soroban, we ensure that this functionality is permissionless and optimized for security and scalability, helping Stellar attract significant liquidity and making it a competitive player in the DeFi space.

Why We Chose Stellar
We selected Stellar’s blockchain infrastructure for three primary reasons:
1. Alignment with Our Vision for Institutional-Grade Liquidity Solutions: Stellar provides the scalability, low transaction fees, and cross-border functionality essential for institutions managing large volumes of digital assets. With Stellar’s infrastructure, we can offer our clients seamless connectivity to manage CEX liquidity more efficiently, allowing them to bridge the gap between centralized exchanges and decentralized applications.
2. Focus on Cross-Border Payments and Financial Inclusion: Stellar’s well-established reputation as a leader in cross-border payments perfectly aligns with our goal to facilitate liquidity management across global markets. For institutional players looking to streamline CEX operations and manage assets across borders, Cede.store and Cede SDK offer the ideal tools to integrate into the Stellar ecosystem.
3. Strong connections with the institutional space and with Ripple: the current niche where Cede Labs is focusing at the moment with Cede SDK product is the custody solutions space. Knowing that Stellar is very close to Ripple, one of the leaders in the institutional custody space with its product Ripple Custody, is a strong argument that led us to choose Stellar. 

This not only empowers financial institutions but also accelerates the integration of Stellar’s ecosystem into mainstream financial operations. As we continue to refine our offerings, Cede Labs is committed to driving the adoption of Stellar by providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for institutional participation in the blockchain ecosystem.

"," III) Launch on MainNet
	From April 2025 to May 2025 - $19 800

- Instant protocol deposit testnet & audit - withdraw from the exchange directly to the protocol

Brief Description
IPD stands for Instant Protocol Deposit. We plan to develop a feature to directly invest user’s CEX assets to a protocol while staying non-custodial. 
For example, a user will be able to invest directly in an AAVE lending pool from his CEX assets.
It allows any players to attract the maximum liquidity from CEX to the user’s wallet.
Similar to transak one (FIAT to smart-contract): https://transak.com/transak-one

How to Measure Completion
Completion will be measured by ensuring on our demo app that funds withdrawn from a CEX are directly deposited into the Stellar protocol on behalf of the user (the user keeps ownership of funds)

Estimated date of completion: May 15, 2025

Budget: $19 800

EquitX,SCF #31,EquitX - Phase 2,EquitX,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recVpLJSgXgMroJVF,Awarded,100,Pre-Launch #3 - Mainnet,$105000.00,$70000.00,243164.14,,Build,"Enabling Stellar users to trade xAssets, participate in governance, and earn liquidity rewards on a secure and flawless DeFi platform.","As a reminder, EquitX enables the creation and management of synthetic assets mirroring small-cap stock performance, enhancing liquidity and investor access.

Our goal with the SCF Build Award is to complete the development of the entire EquitX protocol, bringing it from its current foundational state to full functionality. We have already developed the core smart contracts for collateralization, liquidation, and stability pools, and now aim to finish the entire system. The key areas of development include:

-   Admin tool for new asset onboarding: this tool will enable admins to onboard new xAssets linked to real-time data feeds. Stellar's blockchain will ensure transparent tracking and asset registration, allowing for scalable and efficient asset addition.
    
-   Blockchain indexing system: a Stellar-based indexing system will track all transactions (collateral, trading, liquidation) in real time, improving transparency and auditability while feeding data to the analytics tool. We will use a server for this functionnality.
    
-   Automatic liquidation system: using Soroban smart contracts, this system will automatically liquidate under-collateralized positions based on real-time data from Stellar, ensuring platform stability and mitigating risk.
    
-   DEX interaction: integrate liquidity pools of xAssets into Stellar’s decentralized exchanges, allowing users to trade xAssets at optimal prices. Stellar's DEX framework ensures secure and efficient trade execution.
    
-   Advanced analytics and reporting tool: we will use Stellar's transaction data to develop a tool providing real-time insights into asset performance and platform activity, enhancing user decision-making and platform transparency.
    
-   Full UI/UX development: the final user interface will offer seamless access to all platform functions, powered by Stellar and Soroban, for trading, governance, and analytics.
    

These developments will complete the EquitX protocol, providing users with a fully functional, scalable, and secure platform for trading xAssets, earning rewards, and participating in decentralized governance.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOZHyFoe9iy4MnBr7lNZh-eLi54gLrKEoFymBX5xNyE/edit?tab=t.0,"Success for EquitX is about democratizing access to investments in nano-cap, micro-cap, and small-cap companies, offering opportunities that have traditionally been difficult for retail investors to tap into. The platform’s success will be measured by both quantitative and qualitative outcomes:

1. New users and investor base expansion: we aim to attract a diverse user base, starting with blockchain-savvy investors and expanding to include non-crypto-native investors.

-   Output: Reaching 20,000 active users within the first 12 months of full platform launch, with a balanced mix of both crypto and non-crypto investors.
    
-   Impact: Expanding financial access to traditionally hard-to-reach investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to diversify their portfolios into smaller, high-growth companies. This broadens financial inclusion by offering exposure to markets typically reserved for institutional investors.
    

1. Enhanced liquidity for nano, micro, and small-cap companies: by offering these companies a platform where their stocks are represented as synthetic assets (xAssets), EquitX increases their market visibility and provides an alternative source of liquidity.

-   Output: Onboarding 5+ nano, micro, and small-cap companies as xAssets within the first year. We won’t be integrating more than 5 company xAssets within this first year to keep good liquidity for each asset. 
    
-   Impact: Helping smaller companies grow by increasing their visibility and liquidity without requiring them to go through conventional fundraising channels, such as equity dilution. This can drive economic growth, particularly in niche markets and emerging sectors.
    

1. Increased Trading Volume and Liquidity in the DeFi Space: EquitX expects substantial trading volume within the platform itself, where users can trade synthetic assets backed by small-cap companies. Additionally, EquitX will leverage Stellar’s DEXs to facilitate external trading of xAssets, further enhancing liquidity for both investors and small-cap stocks.

-   Output: Reaching $60 million XLM in total trading volume, both within the EquitX platform and through external trading on Stellar DEXs, within the first year.
    
-   Impact: Bringing new liquidity into the Stellar ecosystem by encouraging the trading of synthetic assets. This will drive platform engagement, while also fostering financial innovation by bridging traditional financial markets and decentralized finance (DeFi).
    

1. Total Value Locked (TVL): EquitX expects to accumulate significant value locked within its platform, providing liquidity for synthetic assets and enhancing trading opportunities.

-   Output: Reaching $15 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the first year.
    
-   Impact: A strong TVL will ensure liquidity and stability across the platform, encouraging more active participation from investors and supporting efficient trading of xAssets. This will also build confidence in the platform’s sustainability and growth potential.
    

1. Number of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs): EquitX aims to drive high user engagement through the opening of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), allowing users to collateralize assets and mint xAssets.

-   Output: Establishing 1,500 CDPs within the first year.
    
-   Impact: The growth in the number of CDPs will demonstrate active user participation and platform trust. This will enhance liquidity within the system and create a more robust market for xAssets, reinforcing the platform’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance.
    

1. Security and transparency: Stellar’s blockchain, combined with Soroban smart contracts, will provide secure, transparent, and efficient transactions for users.

-   Output: Maintaining 100% transparency and security for all platform transactions, with no security breaches or fraud.
    
-   Impact: Enhancing user trust and confidence in the platform, which is crucial for widespread adoption and long-term growth.
    

In summary, success for EquitX will be measured by the growth of its user base, the liquidity it brings to nano, micro, and small-cap companies, the trading volume it facilitates, and the financial opportunities it opens up for a broader audience. The impact goes beyond numbers, EquitX will create a new bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, offering a solution for investors to access untapped market potential in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner.

These numbers are mainly based on a similar protocol, Indigo, that has been launched 2 years ago on Cardano.",https://equitx.com/,https://github.com/EquitXCompany/equitx-project,https://youtu.be/A6r_Rzc2N2A?si=IdNPNvJEmbxhLTO2,Yes,"After completing the development of the EquitX protocol, our go-to-market strategy will follow a phased approach:

-   Content marketing on Discord and X: during the development phase, we will and are already publishing content on Discord and X to build awareness and generate interest in the protocol. We will continue sharing updates and insights, ensuring the community stays engaged and informed as we progress toward launch.
    
-   Rewards and surprises for early users: to create hype and incentivize early adoption, we will announce and offer rewards to users who engage with the platform from the start. This strategy will build excitement around the launch and foster early community loyalty.
    
-   Liquidity injection from investors: to boost initial liquidity, we plan to seek investments for liquidity injection. This will provide a strong foundation for trading and stability pools, ensuring the platform has the liquidity needed to support early users and incentivize engagement.
    
-   Targeted user acquisition: after launch, we will focus on acquiring early adopters from the DeFi community, particularly those interested in synthetic assets and decentralized governance. For that, we may invest in paid marketing on social media to accelerate user growth and ensure broad exposure within the DeFi space.
    
-   Community engagement and governance: launching the governance system early will allow users to actively shape the platform's direction. We will encourage participation through token staking and voting, ensuring the community is deeply involved and rewarded for their engagement, fostering long-term loyalty.
    
-   Educational content and onboarding: to simplify the onboarding process, we will create educational materials such as guides, tutorials, and webinars. This will help users understand how to trade xAssets, participate in governance, and maximize their experience on the platform, fostering trust and usability.
    
-   Collaborations: with other DeFi projects (especially DEXs) of the ecosystem. This will also raise awareness about our protocol and extend our user base from existing Stellar users.
    

Our phased launch will start with governance token distribution and asset onboarding, followed by full functionality like trading and staking. By combining early community engagement through rewards, liquidity injection from investors, and targeted marketing, we will establish a strong initial user base and a stable liquidity environment.","Testnet and Development Phase

Comparable Protocol: 

Indigo Protocol is a decentralized platform on Cardano that creates synthetic assets, similar to EquitX’s approach. However, Indigo focuses on synthetic assets that are native to other blockchains, such as cryptocurrencies, rather than stocks like EquitX. While both platforms share similar technical processes, EquitX uniquely targets synthetic representations of small-cap equities on Stellar’s blockchain. Currently:

-   Indigo’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD stands at $33.81 million with a peak at $125.56 million in March 12, 2024, demonstrating the strong market demand for decentralized synthetic assets​  
    DefiLama
    
-   8,73 million of their stablecoin iUSD is circulating for a total market cap of $7,61 million  
    DefiLlama
    
    Retrospectively, only 2 months after launch, Indigo was at: 
    
-   14.37M TVL 
    
-   6.38M USD in iAssets 
    
-   935 CDPs

","Untangled Vault is an automated, non-custodial, data-driven asset management protocol enabling anyone to set and execute strategies to fit investor risk/return appetite. Untangled Vault is powered by Untangled pool, an asset tokenization protocol focusing on RWA private credits and Credio, a risk oracle providing machine learning model inferences and onchain monitoring of RWA. Untangled Vault is an EVM compatible smart contract platform. This application is to deploy Untangled Vault and necessary supporting components of Untangled Pool and Credio on Stellar.

This presents a unique opportunity for Untangled Finance to make a impact, especially with the launch of the Soroban smart contract platform. RWAs (on any chain including Stellar) face challenges in moving beyond a mere, close-loop tokenisation to a landscape where tokens have more utility on secondary markets e.g. trading, used as collateral in lending markets or composed into products that fit investor risk, return and usage preferences. At Untangled and Credio, our risk modelling and oracle service, we believe these boils down to Product  * a liquid product that can achieve balance between risk, return and liquidity such as tokenized MMF, index funds or short term treasuries * a product that have a low barrier to entry e.g. minimum investment size or KYC particularly for emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Turkey, Ukraine and Nigeria * Stellar infrastructure primitives that can support such product innovations. Legal  * Token is tradable or used as collateral in third party systems after a possible short lock-up period * Minimum KYC requirement on secondary market beyond some compulsory require e.g. sanction list whitelisting Liquidity  * Who can provide liquidity for the secondary market? Think of market makers and other large liquidity providers  * What is optimal incentive design and quantum from the protocols concerned and  Stellar?

RWAs bring scale and stable and uncorrelated income for DAO, helping them to grow their treasury sustainably. However, some RWAs like private credits, whilst having higher yields and bigger real world impact, suffer from low liquidity ('no free lunch' principle in financial markets). With Untangled vault issuers can craft bespoke strategies for DAO treasuries, balancing yields and liquidity. We believe that this is a strong differentiation, currently lacking among RWA investment opportunities on Stellar. \* Institutional users: In a balanced portfolio, RWA yields are a source of stability that institutional users seek.

Coindisco,SCF #30,Galaxy Ramp - fiat onramp to any token on Stellar,Coindisco,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec7yuazvycNZIcvj,Awarded,100,Pre-Launch #3 - Mainnet,$96000.00,$96000.00,330151.27,6/27/2025,Build,Galaxy Ramp offers an onramp for any token on the Stellar network to help users simplify the purchase of Stellar tokens with fiat using Soroban. Existing solutions do not allow direct purchase with a card or bank account on Stellar any tokens except XLM or USDC.,"Existing on-ramp providers currently only support XLM and USDC as the only Stellar tokens users can purchase through their services. 
Galaxy Ramp is a new on-ramp solution that allows users to purchase any Stellar token by combining familiar fiat on-ramp experience with the power of Soroban smart contacts. 
This solution will leverage an on-ramp API integration of one of Coindisco's trusted partners. 
We will build a website, back-end infrastructure and Soroban smart contacts logic for this solution.
The website will allow users to connect their Stellar wallet and initiate purchases of popular Stellar tokens.
In order to purchase a Stellar token, a user will first need to purchase Stellar USDC through our on-ramp partner. Stellar USDC will be used as a “value transfer asset” in this flow. 
When a user initiates a transaction, we will determine the best USDC rate for the asset and display that on the interface along with any fees. 
When a user commits to the transaction, a new proxy Stellar wallet will be created by a Soroban smart contract. That wallet will be associated to user-owned Stellar wallet via our back-end. 
That proxy wallet will be controlled by our back-end and Soroban smart contacts. An asset trustline will be automatically established on the proxy wallet.
The purchased USDC in the transaction will first arrive to the proxy wallet. From there, we will leverage custom back-end service and multiple Soroban smart contracts to find the best asset-to-USDC rate, convert USDC to the asset a user request in the flow, and send the obtained asset balance to user's wallet address.  
We will also create a widget that will allow other products on the network to integrate this product directly and securely.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTdBr2zLeHGrxvXEymB6L2w5LqHBASBUZiw_rJTpI5M,"Based on our market research, we expect Galaxy Ramp to be a popular solution among both Stellar users and product creators. We also expect demand from asset issuers on the network who will look for user-friendly solutions for selling their tokens. Our prospected targets for the first launch year:
- 20,000+ unique customers 
- $500,000+ worth turnover
- 30+ unique Stellar assets purchased by users. 

After the initial launch, we will be offering Galaxy Ramp integration to popular wallets and products on the network. The target is to have the Galaxy Ramp widget solution integrated into 5 unique products on the Stellar network.",https://coindisco.com/,https://github.com/coindisco,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1je8N-mDUdGI5-b_Lmz1to9434H-9mTU8,Yes,"We will launch and promote the Galaxy Ramp web application on social networks and at various fintech conferences. As we integrate with more onramp providers, we'll carry out cross-promotion activities to attract more users. The functionality will also be embedded into the existing Coindisco web and mobile apps. We will also do our best to integrate the Galaxy Widget or SDK into the most popular Stellar products.","Since its launch in Q1 2024, Coindisco has demonstrated stable growth in userbase and revenue, achieving over $100,000 in turnover within the first couple of months since launch. 
With Coindisco, we have established live integrations with leading on- and off-ramp providers such as Moonpay, Revolut, and Stripe, enabling thousands of users worldwide to seamlessly buy crypto. 
Working with multiple on ramp providers, researching customer behavior and the state of the crypto landscape allowed us to develop unique features like 'True fee' and 'Insights' that make Coindisco a stand-out product among other solutions on the market according to user surveys.  
We will leverage that experience when creating the Galaxy Ramp, which will further enhance our offerings and provide a new unique service for the Stellar network that meets the needs of the growing ecosystem.","Deliverable 1:

Rarible’s standard contractual model includes 4 elements:
Rarible has worked with many different chains, teams and foundations,
and can provide a flexible contracting strategy to support our client’s
needs.

For Stellar, we propose a phased approach to acceptance and payment
as follows:

Phase 1: Integration
Licensing and configuration for Stellar NFT minting and trading on
Rarible.com.

Proposed Phase 2
*Note: A Secondary agreement will be required to initiate Phase 2
Phase 2: Marketing
Licensing and configuration of Rarible NFT infrastructure to
support new chain
Annual support and maintenance subscription for deployed
software
Mint pack licensing for per mint platform fees
Coordination services for marketplace success - community and
creator onboarding.

Description: Deploying Rarible NFT infrastructure on Stellar so that
Rarible.com and other parties can mint and trade NFTs on Stellar
via $XLM.

Completion criteria: Demonstration of NFT minting and trading
workflow on Stellar explorer using Rarible delivered contracts and
systems.

Delivery timeframe: Generally 90 days for non-EVM chain.
Creator enablement on Stellar marketplace via Rarible.com.

Phase 3: Incentives
Incentivized Minting for NFT community creation and growth
Rarible believes the best way to “cold-start” a vibrant NFT ecosystem is
through the incentivization of both creators and early adopters. There
are two mechanisms for incentivizing early adopters to pursue the
minting mechanics and make it a habit. Those are by offering free mints,
and by selectively delivering airdrops to the most active minting and
trading wallets. Rarible manages campaigns related to the former, while
we can provide a playbook to our customers on incentivizing airdrops,
while Rarible itself does not conduct these.
Description: Following the acceptance of Phase 1 deliverables,
Rarible will coordinate the strategy and delivery of the first 90 days
of Stellar creator minting. This 90 day plan will feature over 100
artists, creators and projects, and will be designed to drive
awareness and adoption of Stellar NFTs within the Stellar
community, as well as into the broader Rarible.com ecosystem.
Highlights include:

Rarible Takeover Week - First 5 drops will be featured for 5
days on the top of Rarible.com homepage. Associated
marketing

Drop schedule managed by Rarible for the first 3 months with
ongoing marketing support.
Note that Rarible will manage incentivization of creators as
needed to successfully deliver this program. Incentives are
included in Phase cost.
Acceptance criteria: Stellar representative reviews Artist /
collector line up for Rarible.com take over, and approves creator
targets for 90 day campaign.
Payment terms: Due upon Phase 2 kickoff (following Phase 1
acceptance
Delivery timeframe: Rarible.com takeover week within 60 days of
Phase 2 kickoff. Project runs for 90 days following the initial
takeover launch.
Description: Following the acceptance of Phase 2 deliverables, the
Stellar marketplace on Rarible.com will be ready to offer mints.
Historically, Rarible charges a $2 / mint platform fee for each mint
conducted on Rarible.com and on Rarible X marketplaces. This fee
covers the scalable costs of infrastructure as mints increase. For a
Minting Incentivization campaign, Rarible reduces the platform
cost to $0/mint for a specified number of mints, removing the cost
of minting as a barrier to participation. Rarible instead sells a “mint
Note, that following the initial Mint Pack based incentivization phase,
Rarible generally recommends that the customer “turn on” a $2 / mint
platform fee, where that fee is used to offset mint pack costs, and to
fund an ongoing creator enablement fund, thereby making the ongoing
operation of the marketplace self sustaining.
Note, while Rarible does not operate chain specific airdrop incentives,
we would recommend allocating ~ $200,000 of airdrops for the first 90
days.

Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance and Support Annual cost to manage ongoing support of Stellar Marketplace on
Rarible.com
pack” to the customer with a specified number of mints at a
discounted price.
For the initial 90 days of no-cost minting, Rarible recommends
a 500,000 mint pack at the cost of $200,000. This dramatically
reduces the cost per mint to $.40.
Acceptance criteria: This mint pack is accepted upon completion
and acceptance of Phase 2 deliverables.
Payment terms: Due upon Phase 3 kickoff (following Phase 2
acceptance)

Description: Rarible provides a support team dedicated to the
ongoing success of your marketplace, creators and users. We
handle 1st line support via FAQs and a ticketing system, and
manage and deliver to SLAs.

Acceptance criteria: Annual customer review. Acceptance due
prior to expiration of annual agreement.

Relevant improvements include:-

1. Integration of Stellar Payment Rails
   Stellar’s payment rails will facilitate real-time cross-border and local payments, enabling CHATS to seamlessly support multi-currency disbursements. Stellar's infrastructure will ensure transactions happen securely and efficiently, minimising volatility and currency conversion issues.

2. Migration of Reserve Assets to Stellar USDC
  Migrating CHATS’ digital assets  reserve assets to Stellar USDC will help stabilise value during aid disbursements, enabling more transparent tracking of funds. This would  allow for the quick redemption of funds by vendors and aid recipients. 

3. Offline Payment Integration (USSD/SMS)
  Using  Stellar’s payment infrastructure, we will improve CHATS’ offline payment functionalities via USSD and SMS, ensuring transactions are recorded securely and uploaded once beneficiaries access the internet, resulting in secure settlement even in remote areas without internet access.

4. Cash for Work Feature Upgrade
   Stellar's transparency and tokenization will improve CHATS conditional cash transfers for Cash-for-Work programs. Stellar’s advanced smart contract functionality will improve  real-time validation and disbursement of funds, ensuring that only eligible recipients receive aid. 

 Impact on CHATS
- Stellar's infrastructure will enable CHATS to handle more transactions at lesser costs and improve its cross-border aid distribution efficiency.
- The integration of Stellar UDSC will improve the speed and security of aid disbursements.
- Offline capabilities and multi-currency support will ensure that CHATS reaches more beneficiaries, especially in remote, underserved areas.

The pilot grant will develop a sustainability and scalability strategy by linking its CVA delivery mechanisms to new interventions under the USAID Nafoore Activity – Nafoore (“added value” in the Fulani language) is a $17m USAID-funded violent extremism prevention program, rooted in positive youth development. The project is led by Mercy Corps Mauritania.
 
By leveraging blockchain, the pilot will create a more inclusive financial ecosystem that empowers youth to access the seed capital needed to start small businesses and social projects. CHATS can first build trust across institutional stakeholders of the program by ensuring that funds are tracked and used for their intended purpose. CHATS automates the release of funds based on predefined conditions, such as the completion and approval of a business plan, project milestones, business performance metrics; or in the case of an  apprenticeship scheme: timesheets. This ensures funds are used as intended, fostering accountability among young entrepreneurs. Additionally, if the program requires a procurement process, CHATS ensures that preferred vendors are being used by program participants, by managing the transactions between vendors and recipients.

","With the SCF Build Award, Rahat will utilize the Stellar network to enhance aid distribution for vulnerable communities. By integrating existing Rahat modules in Stellar, we will enable secure and swift USDC/XLM disbursements using stellar disbursement platform APIs. Rahat will allow beneficiaries to use simple feature phones or QR cards to receive aid while vendors process transactions through an app for streamlined aid delivery and utilize the existing Stellar's ecosystem. Local vendors will use Rahat's vendor app to facilitate USDC/XLM redemptions for beneficiaries, making digital transactions more accessible.

We plan to integrate weather forecast (eg, https://global-flood.emergency.copernicus.eu/) APIs with Soroban smart contracts to automate aid disbursements in response to disaster conditions, providing timely support. Multisignature approvals via Soroban smart contracts will ensure that aid is distributed only after verification from multiple parties making disbursement secure and accountable.

A beneficiary management tool will help in validating and targeting the aid recipients and onboard them to the rahat distribution platform. This project will enhance Rahat’s open-source ecosystem and complement the Stellar Disbursement Platform.

By contributing to the Stellar ecosystem, we aim to leverage community support to grow and scale Rahat. For more project details: https://bit.ly/3B7QZjM

Arculus x Stellar: Payments With Soroban,SCF #30,Real World Payments with Stablecoins and Tokens on Stellar with Soroban,Arculus x Stellar: Payments With Soroban,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recGwkWWrGuZAuC3b,Awarded,67,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$148400.00,$98933.34,274970.92,,Build,"Arculus enables stablecoin or token holders on Stellar to pay at any Visa/MasterCard merchant, directly from self-custody wallets, utilizing Soroban smart-contracts.","PRODUCT

Utilizing Soroban, Arculus will write the smart contract that will allow holders of stablecoins (and potentially other tokens) on Stellar to use those funds at any merchant worldwide that accepts Visa or MasterCard. This solution allows for payments directly from a self-custody wallet with the consumer not giving up ownership until the moment of spend.

PROBLEM

Cold storage, while highly secure for storage of crypto assets, are often not ideal for a transactional experience. Arculus has already solved this issue with our next-gen hardware wallet that combines the security of cold storage with the usability of a hot wallet.

Currently, the practical utility of using cryptocurrencies in daily commerce, where speed and convenience are paramount, leaves much to be desired. 

Most merchants do not accept direct payment in tokens or stablecoins; most merchants still want fiat currency. At the very few merchants that do accept digital asset payments, it is a slow process of QR codes, deep-linking, or double checking addresses. In short, it is a slower, more difficult process for both consumers and merchants.

Arculus is making it possible to bridge the gap between consumers with digital assets and traditional merchants by extending the unique transactional features of our cold-storage ecosystem - using Soroban smart contracts to connect self-custodied assets to traditional card payment rails. Arculus with Stellar makes it simple and efficient to pay from cold storage with Stellar tokens. That means meeting the current most popular methodology (VISA/MC Card Tap-To-Pay at POS terminals) where its at.

SOLUTION

Arculus is no stranger to the world of traditional payments. Arculus is created by Composecure, which for the past 20 years has been the world's leading manufacturer of metal payment cards.

Utilizing Stellar's new smart contract platform, Soroban, we will write smart contracts that allow fiat payments from self-custody & cold storage utilizing USDC on Stellar. This functionality will be demonstrated through simulated payment transactions with USDC on testnet and mainnet, as a real world payment scenario would require a licensed transmittance of payment to the merchant acquirer via Visanet. This paves the way for many different entities to adopt the smart contract and use in their own localities, for their own models, with their own remitters (Scaleable B2B Soroban Crypto to Fiat functionality with Stellar Anchor integration).

In practice, the smart contract logic would be loaded onto the chip on a card that's also loaded with a Visa or Mastercard applet. A user would tap to pay at any point of sale terminal, and it would act just as a normal fiat tap-to-pay transaction would, except the balance would be deducted from their cold-storage wallet.

**Although USD is the dominant backing currency for stablecoins today, this same solution can work as non USD stablecoins on stellar for this solution.**

WHAT PROBLEMS DOES THIS SOLVE?

This has the potential to solve many issues in a variety of use-cases. Most notably, and obviously, this greatly increases the real world use case of crypto assets - in this case, Stellar. Allowing people to spend their crypto assets in a way that is familiar and as easy as what they already do every day.

Stellar-Aid Example: Distribute Stellar-Aid branded cards that have this smart contract logic loaded - and can receive aid disbursements. Users of this card will be able to immediately utilize the aid, and eliminate Steps 3 and 4 of the Stellar-Aid Workflow, allowing for faster and more simple access to much-needed aid.

Overall, this project solves the problem of current clunky and slow processes of paying for goods or services with crypto assets, and brings the usability to the current premium accepted methodology.",https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1GI27C-G8A2JkL-lsbr8smC3ufmsygxUghMH_cRu82iM/edit?usp=sharing,"Make USDC on Stellar as transactional for consumers around the world as fiat. 
Through B2B Partners, global consumers will start using stablecoins or tokens on the Stellar blockchain for day-to-day real world payments, and continue to store value onto the Stellar Blockchain as a hedge against inflation.",https://www.getarculus.com,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyDhCaCBMjPvo8EzhMEXSFy4WtGPRk0MI4Z7Ae8Ipgg/edit?usp=sharing,https://vimeo.com/1010382415?share=copy,Yes,"Our go-to-market strategy is to bring on B2B partners that are already active in the crypto-space or in card payments, and bring them the efficiency and speed of payments on Stellar. Arculus is already working with Moneygram as an on and off ramp for USDC on Stellar. 
Additionally, we see the potential for a remittance card product that allows consumers to more easily access their USDC on Stellar. We also see a very valuable use with Stellar Aid-Assist, where Aid recipients could directly send or spend Aid funds anywhere that accepts Visa or Mastercard.

						a. There are two contracts, the controller contract and the collateral contract. There will be a single instance of the controller contract           						(owned by an administrator). It deploys an instance of the collateral contract for a particular user. The controller contract also invokes operations in the collateral contract.
 						b. Completion for this milestone is validated by the completion of the second milestone, when the controller deploys the instance of the collateral contract and invokes given operations in the collateral contract.

 				2. [Develop Soroban Collateral #2 - Collateral]
						a. Developed in tandem with the Controller contract. There will be an instance of the collateral contract for each user. The user ""owns"" the collateral contract but cannot perform operations on it directly. The collateral contract holds a balance of crypto assets. It also tracks a spent amount for each asset, which limits the amount the user can withdraw.
 						b. Completion for this milestone is validated by the completion of the first milestone, when the Collateral contract and it's operations are invoked through the Controller contract.

             d. $42,300


			3. [Develop Operations Architecture]
						a. There are four main operations. These operations are invoked by the UI on the controller contract and must be authorized by the administrator. The controller contract will then invoke the corresponding operation on the collateral contract. The collateral contract will only allow operations initiated by the controller contract. The four operations are described below.

- Spend: Spend some amount of a particular crypto asset. The administrator initiates this operation when the user performs a spend operation in the financial arena, such as a purchase using a card. If there is a sufficient balance in the asset, the collateral contract increments the spent amount for that asset.
- Payment: The administrator initiates this operation when the user makes a payment to pay down the outstanding balance. This reduces the spent amount of the appropriate asset.
- Withdraw: The user requests to withdraw the collateral balance to another crypto account. The user may withdraw the balance of the asset minus the spent amount.
- Liquidate: The bank seizes the collateral assets. The spent amount of the appropriate asset is sent to the bank's treasury account.

 						b. Completion for this milestone is validated by initial testing of the Soroban Collateral, where invoking the controller contract, authorized by the admin, invokes corresponding operations on the collateral contract. This milestone requires testable functionality of the first two milestones.

It removes complexity from crypto routing and navigating on-/offramp steps.,"TransferMole currently consists of 2 parts:

Part 1: Social payment directory - maps social media usernames to financial termination accounts (e.g. crypto address on any supported chain, bank account, debit card)
Part 2: Payment routing network - provides available payment methods based on recipient's termination account

With the SCF Build Award, we would like to expand the payment routing network to Stellar's on- and off-ramp partners. This would provide people more localised payment options when sending and receiving payments with social media usernames. The SCF Build Award helps to launch the following additional features: 

Feature 1: Offramp from embedded wallet
- When users sign up to TransferMole, they currently add a receiving crypto address or create a new wallet (we have integrated Circle's programmable wallets with private key abstraction for Web2 users)
- With the Build Award, users could directly offramp their USDC balance with Stellar's local offramp providers
- Example: Freelancer receives USDC payment to Telegram username and off-ramps to local bank account via Stellar anchor

Feature 2: Pay social username with local payment option
- Today, users can make payments to Telegram, Instagram and other social media usernames. Each username resolves to a payment page with available payment options based on how the recipient can receive funds. Today's payment options are (1) USDC from Ethereum, Base, Avalanche or Polygon and (2) Visa/Mastercard
- With the Build Award, the available payment options could be expanded and include local payment services
- Example: Send USDC payment to Telegram username and on-ramp using a local e-wallet",https://docsend.com/view/pdrenfqpav5v4cmc,"We expect to service 500,000 users by Q1 2025, across Web2 and Web3, who use their Telegram or social username to receive payments for the following use cases:
- Freelancers accepting client payments with the LinkedIn, Google or other social username
- Creators/Influencers engaging their Web2 audience with giveaways/airdrops to their Telegram, Instagram or Tiktok usernames
- Migrant workers, families and friends supporting people overseas with casual transfers to their social username

Ultimately, irrespective of the use case, our mission is to simplify global P2P payments by removing the need to understand crypto or cross-border payments. For us, success is when people start sharing their social usernames for one-off payment acceptance, especially around social commerce.",https://www.transfermole.com,,https://www.loom.com/share/bd69aa76e72f4efea878180cd8283b84?sid=ea25cfc9-6d39-433a-a4c1-3977a57b62c0,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","We just signed a partnership with YesCoin, one of the top rated Telegram games.

Trustful,SCF #30,"Trustful v1 – System Decentralization, Quadradic Funding Reputation Based, Community Incentives and Developer Resources",Trustful,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recnj68U9UZAHjBOi,Awarded,100,Pre-Launch #3 - Mainnet,$92000.00,$61333.34,385329.74,,Build,"Decentralizing/enhancing Trustful to enable limitless use cases, fostering a solid governance and reputation ecosystem on Stellar.","Next steps
The product is evolving from a MVP to a fully-fledged V1 platform that:
- Utilizes Stellar Badges and Smart Contracts: Transitioning from a database to smart contracts on the Stellar network to enhance security, transparency, and decentralization.
- Empowers User Profiles: Introduces user profiles that allow members to showcase their contributions and reputation within the Stellar ecosystem.
- Enables Reputation-Based Groups/Communities: Allows the creation of reputation groups/communities where members define what is important within their context, leveraging Stellar ecosystem quests.

This V1 phase aims to build on the initial MVP by creating a more sophisticated and impactful reputation system that deeply integrates with the Stellar ecosystem, advancing beyond simple contributions to shape the future of community governance and resource distribution.

Trustful use cases and Stellar ecosystem growth
1. Creating Reputation-Backed Communities The system enables the creation of communities within the Stellar ecosystem that are backed by reputation data. This approach encourages the formation of small, active nodes of communities—whether they consist of developers, event organizers, or builders—based on shared interests and goals. These communities are formed through a series of reputation badges and corresponding scores. The badge system allows communities to define what is important to them through quests, thereby attracting and aggregating like-minded individuals. This leads to the establishment of specialized working groups that are aligned with the community’s values and objectives. By leveraging reputation data, these reputation-backed communities not only strengthen the social fabric of the Stellar ecosystem but also ensure that collaboration and growth are driven by shared commitments and contributions, rather than just token holdings.
2. Reputation as Data for Decision-Making Reputation data can be seamlessly integrated into decision-making processes, such as grant applications, to enhance the fairness and impact of resource allocation. Take, for instance, the user flow within the Stellar Community Fund (SCF). Applicants can link their wallets, along with the wallets of their team members involved in the project. These wallets will reflect the cumulative reputation earned within the Stellar ecosystem.

Check the use case flow here.

Some use cases drive:
- First Stellar Quadradic Funding Reputation Based: In this incredible use case, reputation acts as a multiplier for voting power, allowing users with fewer tokens to amplify their influence based on their contribution to the ecosystem. By engaging in key activities such as participating in community quests, interacting with Stellar dApps, and maintaining an active presence, users accumulate reputation badges that can increase their voting power to a quadradic funding to small projects or events. What if the major Stellar conferences were funded this way from now on?
- Incentivizing more members to register on the SCF dashboard: Encouraging broader participation by getting more community members to sign up and engage with the Stellar Community Fund (SCF).
- Encouraging all team members of applicants to register and complete quests: Promoting the accumulation of reputation within the ecosystem, fostering quality interactions between Stellar and grantees.
- Motivating active members to remain engaged: Offering the opportunity to earn reputation and be considered for roles such as ambassadors, voters, and other key positions, thus keeping them actively involved in the ecosystem.
- Incentivizing interaction with dApps on Stellar: Encouraging engagement from users and builders, and attracting more high-quality protocols to the ecosystem by leveraging an active user base.

In summary:
The system encourages broader participation by motivating more members to participate in Stellar actions, thus increasing engagement with the Stellar Community Fund. 

It promotes a culture where all team members of applicants are encouraged to sign up and complete quests, helping them build their reputation within the ecosystem. This approach fosters meaningful interactions between Stellar and its grantees. 

Active members are incentivized to stay engaged by offering them the chance to earn reputation, making them eligible for important roles such as ambassadors, voters, grantees and other key positions. By driving interaction with dApps on Stellar, the system not only boosts user and builder engagement but also attracts more high-quality protocols to the ecosystem, benefiting from an active and thriving user base.

- Output:
    - Number of Reputation Badges imported, issued, and created
    - Number of communities creating their own reputation frameworks
    - Number of new users funding their wallets and using Trustful to interact with the Stellar ecosystem
    - Increase in transactions related to reputation building and quadratic funding
    - Builders creating and using wallets to receive funds, and the number of projects funded

- Impact:
    - Expanding financial access by enabling a broader range of users to engage with the Stellar ecosystem, especially those who may not have had access to traditional financial services.
    - Democratizing funding by allowing smaller contributions to have a meaningful impact through the quadratic funding mechanism.
    - Strengthening ecosystem participation by incentivizing more users to engage in governance and funding, thus building a more active and reputable community.
    - Empowering builders by providing accessible funding and resources, enabling innovation and further growth within the Stellar ecosystem.

By focusing on both quantitative outputs and qualitative impacts, success would not only be about scaling numbers but also about the meaningful change these activities bring to the ecosystem and broader financial inclusion.",https://trustful-stellar.vercel.app/,https://github.com/blockful-io/trustful-stellar-dapp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXrUs-s8TvM,Yes,"Our go-to-market plan focuses on leveraging a quadratic funding event as a key launch strategy and integration with other dApps on Stellar
This event will serve as the first big real-world application of Trustful's reputation system, driving immediate engagement and showcasing the platform's unique value in decentralized governance and funding.

We plan to:
1. Engage key communities and partners within the Stellar ecosystem to participate in and promote the event, building early traction.
2. Activate growth strategies by incentivizing both participants and voters through reputation-based rewards, ensuring continuous engagement beyond the event.
3. Expand marketing efforts across social media, crypto forums, and partnerships with influential players in the Stellar space, highlighting the event as a milestone for the future of decentralized funding.
4. Showcase case studies and success stories from the event to attract additional communities, users, and developers to adopt and integrate Trustful’s reputation system.
5. Iterate quickly based on feedback from participants and early adopters, making improvements to drive long-term scalability and adoption.

The Funding Formula:
- Matching Pool: A pool of funds is set aside by the Stellar Community Fund (SCF) to match donations from individual contributors. Trustful's reputation system will play a critical role in determining how these funds are allocated, leveraging reputation as a factor to amplify the impact of each contributor's support.
- Donations: Individuals contribute to the projects they support, and those with a higher reputation on Trustful—earned through previous participation in the ecosystem—may have enhanced influence in the donation process. Their reputation can help boost the visibility and impact of their contributions in the quadratic matching process.
- Quadratic Matching: The key to quadratic funding is the matching formula. The matching amount is calculated in a way that prioritizes breadth of support over the size of individual donations. In Trustful's system, reputation will be an additional layer that affects the matching calculation. The more individual contributors a project has, and the higher the reputation of these contributors on Trustful, the larger the matching amount it can receive. This means that even small contributions from highly reputable community members can have a greater impact than larger contributions from users with lower reputation.

Example:
- User A: Contributes $50, has no reputation badges.
- User B: Contributes $30, but has several reputation badges on Trustful, earning them a 5% reputation multiplier.
Even though User B contributed a smaller amount, their reputation boosts their influence, making their contribution count for more in the quadratic funding calculation. This creates a system where reputation and community engagement play a central role, ensuring that projects are supported by a broad base of trusted and active participants.

Obs:
This initiative is aimed at supporting and incentivizing contributors who drive education around Stellar and Trustful. A key growth strategy here is that projects receiving rewards through this QF round will be required to create educational content or projects related to Stellar and Trustful, giving a significant boost to both together.

Additionally, all participants will be using Trustful for this QF, allowing us to launch a real use case of reputation-driven resource allocation, this will generate further growth, as the round will be focused on educational projects about Trustful and Stellar, driving awareness and engagement across the community.

We also plan to:
1. Expand Trustful’s reputation use cases: By integrating real-time SCF data, we'll create new pathways for grantees and funders to engage with reputation-based funding.
2. Drive community adoption: The Stellar quests integration will encourage more users to participate and build reputation, enhancing engagement through SCF-related tasks.
3. Showcase new features: During the launch, we will promote the SCF API integration to highlight how Trustful can enhance transparency and efficiency in grant distribution.
4. Target developers and partners: By offering resources open-source and storybooks, we’ll attract developers and ecosystem partners to build on Stellar and use Trustful, further expanding its capabilities and use cases.


Note that some dApps, such as Tansu and also the Brazilian ambassadors community, are already prepared and taking the first steps to integrate Trustful into their activities. The QF round will take place after we achieve all the milestones, gather user feedback, and implement necessary improvements to ensure the QF round runs smoothly.","We launched an MVP as part of our first application – this is a Legacy project. 
This proposal is aimed at preparing the dApp to generate real traction moving forward. The MVP was recently presented to the community during a call on Discord, which helped us gather valuable feedback and insights on the platform’s usability. The feedback received will inform the next steps and improvements, setting the foundation for broader adoption and user engagement.","MVP is live!

After building Kontrol, we maintained and improved it through paid formal verification engagements. Developers can freely use the tool, but many projects and protocols hire us to assist with writing tests and proofs and to guide them through the verification process.
Additionally, we monetize Kontrol by charging larger protocols for the compute power necessary to run proofs on their extensive codebases, as these often outgrow the developer's local resources.
For Komet, we plan to replicate this strategy. After completing the grant project, we will offer Komet to the Stellar community as an open-source tool for developers to use. Beyond that, we will provide services to help projects write formal verification proofs, execute them, and optimize the tool for their specific needs, ensuring the highest level of security. This will allow us to continue developing Komet while building long-term relationships within the Stellar ecosystem.

","For prior traction and validation, we would like to highlight our success with Kontrol, a tool similar to Komet but built for Solidity instead of Rust and Soroban. Kontrol has been widely adopted by hundreds of developers, including professional auditing firms, solo auditors, and internal testing teams. Notably, major protocols such as Optimism and Lido have incorporated Kontrol into their security flow. This widespread usage validates the core concept of Komet and demonstrates the demand for such a tool in blockchain ecosystems.

As for Komet itself, we have already begun exploring its application during the FxDAO smart contract audit. During this audit (available here),  we discovered 10 informational and 10 potentially critical findings. Of the critical findings, considering the hypothetical creation of tests designed using the invariants raised in the audit, 7 out of the 10 would likely have been discovered using fuzzing, and definitely would have been found using formal verification. While not trivial to be identified during testing, the remaining three could be validated and demonstrated using Komet’s formal verification capabilities. Of the 10 informative findings, three could have been found using either fuzzing or formal verification, and the remaining 7 are related to protocol design or best practices. Not only would Komet help shorten the duration of audits due to the ease of validating invariants, but would also empower developers and engineers to test and protect their own code.

Going forward, we believe that Komet could make all future Soroban audits more efficient, enabling developers and auditors alike to catch critical issues earlier in the development cycle. This validation from both Kontrol’s success and Komet’s real-world applicability shows that Komet is poised to have a substantial impact on the Soroban ecosystem.","Tranche 1 has already been completed using the previous SCF #28 activation award of $50,000.

After a successful POC phase. Tansu is starting to show our vision and can be played with on Testnet.

We have an ambitious proposal for the Build award. Besides the road to mainnet and real adoption, we have two objectives:
1. Offer a decentralized platform for developers to maintain and interact with projects;
2. Add an emphasis on people behind projects through the use of reputation badges.

Decentralized organization

Projects will have access to their own Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community of a project will be able to vote on new features or organizational changes. There are several SCF open source projects we might be able to leverage. The project will have a wallet and the DAO will be used to control the funds allocation. There are going to be mainly two pools. The first pool is dedicated to developers. Funds will be automatically distributed to active maintainers based on specific criteria. The rest of the funds would be managed by the DAO for other purposes such as compensating non-developers, infrastructure costs, or even organizing events. The use of a complex system of redistributions typically used in web3 projects, such as Quadratic Funding (QF), will be evaluated.

Tools will be implemented to add/remove maintainers programmatically based on the on-chain status of the project. To that end, we are already leveraging Soroban Domains and will continue to do so and see how we can extend our partnership. Discussions are in progress to get a standard around metadata for instance.

Other personas will be added on-chain as to give other responsibilities. This will further increase projects' transparency and give all participants some visibility.

Release process on-chain. From triggering the release to registering it.

Add a level of trust per hash. Combining time based rules with additional factors such as voting from maintainers, to mark specific hashes as more trusted: this introduces a finality concept and enables consumers of the contract to use specific trust levels depending on their own risk profile. We will evaluate the possibility to combine this concept with an automatic update of the hash. This would allow a fully trustless mode of operation. Linked to that, we will add tools to reject a hash. As maintainers can get compromised, it is important to have means to indicate that a project and person is compromised.

Finally, users will be able to subscribe to projects to get news about new trusted releases, security related issues and DAO events.

The people behind the code

Behind projects, we have people. We want to add profiles for people registered on-chain and recognise their contributions. We will leverage the solution from Trustful and build yet another sustainable partnership between SCF projects.

Badges are not vanity tokens. They will play an essential role in defining permissions on the protocol. Linked to the DAO, badges will reflect the level of trust the community has in someone.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Mz1cMHRRFikdieiE3SKmVQzDskjQKQiu9ljgVO_I7g/edit?usp=sharing,"Besides completing the tranches, the success of our project will primarily be measured by the number of open-source projects registered. Moving past registrations, we will look at how often on-chain data is updated and how our dApp is used. Note that we will never use any invasive tracking solution on the dApp and only GDPR compliant solutions will be considered.

On the community side, we hope that Tansu will enable more decentralized communities of developers to exist. Ultimatly, we wish for the whole development lifecycle to happen in a decentralized way, outside of solutions like GitHub.

Last but not least, if our project can successfully detect a security incident and warn users effectively, it would be a huge win.",https://tansu.dev,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://youtu.be/JsE4JGm-6Fs,Yes,"As a public good project, we don't yet have concrete monetisation plans. At that point we are more interested into providing monetisation tools to support the projects on our platform. The Support button will allows people to show their support in XLM to a project and if they wish, give a tip to the platform. Monthly options will also be made available and could generate a constant revenue stream.

As we add new features, driven by community feedback, we might add more enterprise oriented features. At that point we are thinking about adding some fees to specific contract calls and features in the dApp itself.

Regardless of a hypothetical monetization, we have a strong commitment toward open-source and our code will remain public. We will ensure that there is a great documentation so that anyone can freely Quickstart our infrastructure and build on top of it as they wish. Consulting Manao GmbH, our company, will also be open for consulting services on Tansu and related technologies.","Pamphile presented Tansu to a ""community call of the mind"" where it was well received. People have also been engaging positively on our project page. We started a collaboration with the Trustful team. And we have been interacting with the Soroban Domains team to propose a specification for an Ersatz of a SEP1 file.

Besides these public communications, Pamphile also interacted with prominent members of the Stellar community and they shared their enthusiasm.

Tansu is just starting on testnet and we just kicked of the public communication phase as we have something people can actually use now. We hope that in the following weeks we will get more traction.","The planning outlined below, and in the other tranches, assumes an average level of effort of 15 per week per person for a total duration of 6 months making it sustainable in terms of development engagement for all parties.
For simplicity, the start of the tranche is represented as W1-for Week 1. While the developers have some affinity, backend/frontend/contract, all developers will be involved on all aspects of the proposal.

Subs,SCF #30,Subs SDK: Scaling Global Subscriptions with Stellar Payments,Subs,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recFudOvNezhmYZig,Awarded,67,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$139480.00,$92986.66,544385.43,,Build,Subs offers an SDK to help businesses manage blockchain subscriptions using Stellar's Soroban smart contracts.,"What Subs Is:
Subs SDK is an all-in-one development toolkit specifically designed to enable developers to create, manage, and optimize subscription-based Dapps on Stellar. With a focus on recurring crypto payments, Subs SDK simplifies the integration of blockchain-based subscription services, making it easier for businesses to leverage Stellar’s technology to offer subscription models without complexity.

The Problem:
Managing recurring payments and subscriptions in blockchain environments can be a complex and time-consuming process, particularly for businesses that are accustomed to traditional payment systems. There is a lack of straightforward solutions that combine ease of use with the security and transparency of decentralized payments, making it difficult for companies to adopt blockchain-based subscription models efficiently.

The Solution:
Subs provides a comprehensive SDK that simplifies the creation and management of recurring payment services on Stellar. The Subs SDK offers the following key components:

1. Recurring Payments Automation:
    - Description : Subs SDK simplifies the creation and management of automated, recurring payment systems on Stellar. This allows businesses to handle subscription models with ease, ensuring that customers' payments are processed automatically without manual intervention. With features like smart contract automation, developers can build robust, scalable recurring billing systems in no time.
    - Avantage : Simplifies payment collection and subscription management for businesses, with transparent on-chain validation.

2. Flexible Subscription Models:
    - Description : The SDK supports a variety of subscription models, including daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly subscriptions, with the ability to customize trial periods, SEP-41 token types, and pricing structures. It also allows for ""buy-now, pay-later"" schemes and partial payments.
    - Avantage : Businesses can tailor subscription plans to their specific needs, increasing flexibility and customer satisfaction.Additionally, Subs ensures that all smart contracts are regularly maintained and ""bumped"" to prevent automatic deletion, so businesses don't have to worry about contract expiration or disruption of services​​.

3. Sponsored Transactions for End-Users:
    - Description : Subs SDK integrates a sponsored transaction system where businesses can absorb transaction fees, allowing users to subscribe without worrying about network fees. This is particularly useful in onboarding new crypto users who may be unfamiliar with Stellar's native gas fees. Additionally, users could benefit from a faucet option, where merchants can provide the XLMs needed to activate their addresses and sponsor transactions, further simplifying the onboarding process.
    - Avantage : This approach improves user experience by removing common friction points in blockchain transactions, increasing subscription rates. By offering both sponsored transactions and a merchant-supported faucet, we make it easier for new users to engage with the platform and participate in the ecosystem.

4. Multi-Currency Support and Cross-Chain Compatibility:
    - Description : Subs SDK will support multiple tokens such as stablecoins like USDC. 
    - Avantage : This feature will attract businesses that operate globally and need to cater to users using different currencies.

5. Data Privacy and Decentralized Security:
    - Description : Leveraging Stellar's Soroban smart contract framework, Subs SDK ensures all payment transactions and subscription data are securely stored on-chain without exposing sensitive personal information. Data is stored on Aleph and encrypted, similar to how emails are secured, guaranteeing that subscription details are immutable and verifiable.
    - Avantage : Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reassuring businesses and users that their financial and personal data are secure.

6. Developer-Friendly Tools & API Integration:
    - Description : Subs SDK offers robust API support, that provides real-time insights into subscription performance, customer retention, and payment success rates.
    - Avantage : Developers can save time and effort by integrating external services and leveraging a complete development toolkit. Additionally, They will have a new way to monetize their work through a subscription model or recurring donation.

Through our preliminary market research, we’ve observed key trends in the adoption of subscription services across multiple world sub-regions, particularly in markets that are expanding their digital financial infrastructure. Our research focused on businesses operating in regions like Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where cross-border payments and recurring financial services like micro-lending, mobile payments, and subscription models are rapidly growing.
- Latin America: In countries like Brazil and Mexico, businesses are increasingly looking for efficient and low-cost ways to manage recurring payments, especially for subscription services like SaaS platforms, content creators, and telecommunications. However, traditional banking fees are prohibitive, making blockchain solutions like Stellar’s low-fee transactions ideal for these businesses.
- Africa: In regions where mobile payments dominate like Ferdinand's country, Togo, there is a growing need for blockchain-based recurring payments to enable micro-insurance, subscription services for utilities, and other financial products. With Stellar's accessibility and low transaction fees, Subs SDK is positioned to provide businesses with a secure and scalable solution to manage recurring billing efficiently.
- Southeast Asia: In countries like Indonesia and Philippines, the rise of digital financial services, combined with the need for cross-border payment solutions, creates an opportunity for Subs SDK to power global subscription services. 

We chose Stellar for two main reasons:
1. Alignment with our vision for global financial access: Stellar’s blockchain infrastructure provides the scalability, low-cost transactions, and cross-border functionality that are crucial for businesses looking to offer subscription services in emerging markets.
2. Cross-border payment focus: Stellar is widely recognized for its ability to facilitate cross-border payments, making it the perfect network to help businesses in developing markets manage global subscriptions.

Stellar’s focus on financial inclusion aligns with our goal to bring decentralized recurring payments to regions where traditional financial services are underdeveloped. By leveraging Stellar’s Soroban smart contracts, we are offering a blockchain solution that will empower businesses to manage recurring payments and subscriptions, especially in markets where banking services are less reliable.","Milestone 1:  Development of Subs Soroban Smart Contracts

Every.finance,SCF #30,EveryFinance: bringing Decentralized ETFs on Stellar,Every.finance,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/reck82uQhTmQhx8Yr,Awarded,0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$140000.00,$46666.67,102248.86,12/9/2024,Build,Offers decentralized ETFs to help crypto investors on Stellar to optimize yields and manage risk with automated portfolio rebalancing and yield strategies.,"What EveryFinance Is:
Every Finance is a decentralized finance platform offering decentralized Exchange-Traded Funds (dETFs). It features diversified investments across major blockchains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon networks), rebalanced with proprietary algorithms based on risk parity principles. The platform aims to democratize hedge fund advantages and index fund diversification, making optimized yield farming accessible to all. Every Finance focuses on providing simple, secure, and effective portfolio management in the volatile crypto space.

The Problem:
Managing and optimizing investments in the complex and rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is a real challenge. Specifically, how to solve the problem of navigating the volatility, risk, and fragmented nature of the DeFi ecosystem. 

The Solution:
By offering a platform that combines 
- sophisticated risk management, 
- automated portfolio rebalancing, 
- and yield optimization through DeFi strategies, 
Every.Finance empowers users to create and manage diversified portfolios that are tailored to their specific risk tolerance and financial goals. The platform simplifies the process of accessing high-yield opportunities while maintaining control over risk, making DeFi more accessible and effective for both novice and experienced investors..

How Every.Finance Works on Stellar
Every.Finance operates as an intelligent investment platform that allows users to create and manage diversified portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and financial objectives. Here’s how it works:
1. Portfolio Creation: Users start by selecting a risk level (e.g., conservative, balanced, aggressive) or customizing their own asset allocations based on personal preferences. The platform offers various investment products like Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, each representing different risk-return profiles.
2. Asset Selection and Allocation: Based on the chosen risk profile, Every.Finance allocates funds across a diversified mix of assets, such as stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets. These assets are selected using an in-house strategy that emphasizes both potential returns and risk management.
3. Yield Optimization: Once assets are allocated, they are farmed using various DeFi strategies, such as staking, liquidity provision, and yield farming, to generate additional income or ""extra yield."" This step is automated, leveraging the best opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem to enhance returns.
4. Automated and User Rebalancing: To maintain the desired risk-return profile, Every.Finance periodically rebalances the portfolio. Market rebalancing occurs automatically based on market conditions, while user rebalancing allows investors to manually adjust allocations according to their evolving strategies.
5. Risk Management: Throughout the process, robust risk management protocols ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the investor’s risk tolerance. This involves careful selection of assets, strategic deployment in DeFi, and constant monitoring to mitigate potential risks.
6. Fees and Profit Sharing: The platform charges management and performance fees, which are calculated based on the performance of the portfolio and are periodically deducted. A portion of performance fees is allocated to a profit-sharing pool, allowing users to benefit collectively from successful strategies.

Uses of Every.Finance
- For New Investors: Provides an accessible entry point into the DeFi space, with automated portfolio management and risk mitigation tools that simplify investing.
- For Experienced Investors: Offers advanced features such as custom portfolio creation, manual rebalancing, and access to high-yield DeFi strategies, allowing for greater control and optimization.
- For Yield Seekers: Enables investors to maximize their returns by leveraging DeFi strategies like yield farming and staking, which are typically complex and time-consuming to manage independently.
- For Risk-Conscious Investors: Offers tailored risk management, ensuring that portfolios remain within acceptable risk levels while still seeking to generate returns.

- Retention Rate: A high retention rate of 60-70% of users remaining active after their first interaction would be key to long-term success. Retention will be boosted by consistent platform updates and value-added services.

Platform Performance and Yield:
- Yield Performance: The goal is to outperform industry benchmarks by providing 5-7% annual yield on conservative portfolios and up to 15% annual yield on aggressive portfolios. This performance would attract both retail and institutional investors seeking optimized returns.
- Risk Management: Maintain at least 95% compliance with user-defined risk levels to build trust and ensure portfolios remain aligned with investors’ goals.

EA Kazi is a groundbreaking web3 NFT certificate platform designed to bridge the gap between training and employment. By integrating certification with lifelong royalties, EA Kazi ensures that trainers are incentivized to provide high-quality education, while trainees gain verifiable credentials that enhance their job prospects. Built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts, EA Kazi combines the best aspects of platforms like Udemy and Freelancer into a single, cohesive ecosystem. This innovative approach creates a seamless connection between learning and earning, fostering a community of skilled professionals and reputable trainers.

The Problem:
In the current digital economy, the demand for verifiable skills and experienced freelancers is higher than ever. However, several challenges persist: Lack of Verifiable Credentials: Many online courses provide certificates that are easily forged or lack credibility, making it difficult for employers to trust the qualifications of potential hires. Trainer Incentives: Trainers often receive one-time payments for their courses, which disincentivizes them from continually updating and improving their content. Fragmented Platforms: Freelancers must navigate multiple platforms for training and job opportunities, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

EA Kazi’s Solution:
EA Kazi addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform where training, certification, and job opportunities coexist seamlessly: NFT Certificates: Upon completing a course, trainees receive NFT certificates stored on the Stellar blockchain. These certificates are immutable and easily verifiable by potential employers, ensuring the credibility of the trainee's skills. Lifelong Royalties for Trainers: Trainers earn royalties from the projects trainees complete using their certifications. This continuous revenue stream incentivizes trainers to maintain high-quality, relevant content. Integrated Ecosystem: EA Kazi combines training, certification, and job opportunities on one platform. Trainees can easily transition from learning to earning, while recruiters can access a pool of verified, skilled freelancers.

User Dashboards:
Freelancer/Trainee Dashboard: Displays available courses, job opportunities, and payment information. Trainees can track their certifications and apply for jobs directly through the platform. Recruiter Dashboard: Enables recruiters to post job opportunities and review applications from certified freelancers. Recruiters can easily verify the credentials of applicants, streamlining the hiring process. Trainer Dashboard: Allows trainers to list courses, track their trainees, and view their royalty earnings. Trainers can see the impact of their courses and adjust content based on trainee success.

Integration with Stellar and Soroban Smart Contracts:
EA Kazi leverages the Stellar blockchain and Soroban smart contracts to ensure a secure, efficient, and transparent platform. Here's how it integrates: NFT Creation and Management: Soroban smart contracts handle the creation, issuance, and management of NFT certificates. These contracts ensure that each certificate is unique, verifiable, and immutable. Royalty Distribution: Soroban smart contracts automate the distribution of royalties to trainers. Every time a trainee secures and completes a project using their NFT certificate, the smart contract ensures that the trainer receives their rightful share. Secure Transactions: Stellar’s blockchain provides fast, low-cost transactions, making it ideal for managing payments between trainees, trainers, and recruiters.

Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.

Our app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.

Remittance & Payment

Problem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.

Solution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.

How it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.

Saving

Problem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.

Solution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.

How it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.

Communal Funding

Problem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.

Solution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.

How it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.

Rotating Savings and Credit Associations

Problem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.

Solution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.

How it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.

Virtual Card

Problem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.

Solution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.

How it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",,,https://lulpay.com/,https://github.com/lulpay/mainproject,https://youtu.be/I1HdReH4QaY,,,,,,,Zerayacob,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/zerayacob-a-tedla-1abb64b9/,,https://discord.gg/rC4jqHmA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLRKI_Q0KiIEo00DG9x3H1ozBFqmaFGD/view?usp=sharing

Its primary goal is to provide projects and companies building on Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem with a secure and decentralized infrastructure for launching and raising funds. This is achieved through its token pool IDO, token sale, and incubation protocol. Additionally, SoroStarter assists these projects and companies in significantly growing their communities and expanding their projects' reach and adoption through an incentivized community engagement mechanism. Furthermore, SoroStarter enables end-users—both investors and the Stellar Lumen community as a whole—to gain secure early access to quality, well-vetted IDOs and token sales of projects on Soroban.

The products of SoroStarter encompass its two main features:

SoroStarter’s IDO/Sale Protocol: A secure and decentralized IDO and fundraising protocol which operates on Soroban, facilitating seamless participation of users, investors, and community members in IDOs on the Soroban blockchain. Based on preset IDO/sales parameters, the protocol algorithmically manages allocation, access, token unlocking and distribution, refunds, and the release of raised funds post-sale.

SoroStarter's IDO Selection and Onboarding Mechanism: An efficient vetting and selection process which is used to evaluate projects listed on SoroStarter for IDO or token sale opportunities. At its core is an online governance voting mechanism on Soroban, enabling members of the Stellar Lumen community to vote on projects to be listed on SoroStarter for a launch.

A critical requirement in any blockchain ecosystem with smart contract capabilities is the ability for dApps and projects to deploy easily and establish their own independent economies. Many of these economies depend on utility tokens specific to their ecosystem. For example, consider a GameFi or play-to-earn project, which often relies on NFTs for player access and an in-game token for rewards and purchases. These projects need a reliable, decentralized, and secure method to launch their tokens and ecosystem assets. By providing this capability, more projects with independent economies and value-driven ecosystems can be launched. This attracts a larger user base to the project's community, thereby expanding the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. SoroStarter addresses these needs on Soroban and Stellar Lumen by offering a dependable, decentralized, and secure platform for projects building on Soroban to launch tokens and raise funds. This contributes to the overall adoption and growth of the ecosystem.

SoroStarter's core features, mechanisms, and protocols are built and deployed on Soroban, the Stellar's native smart contract platform. It leverages Soroban's robust capabilities for smart contracts and transaction processing. Our governance mechanism and IDO/Sale protocol smart contracts are developed and deployed on Soroban, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency in project selection and fundraising processes. Additionally, we utilize the Stellar SDK to seamlessly integrate these Soroban contracts with our application's user interfaces. This integration enhances user experience and improves usability.

Some of our deployments and integrations can be seen on SoroStarter's MVP currently deployed on Futurenet. Here are the important links:

With Unalivio, merchants can perform digital sales and get paid in USDC","Unalivio is an online payments tool for brick-and-mortar retailers, and a cross border payments system. Unalivio pays out in USDC because it is specifically made for LatAm. Unalivio allows users to pay for goods for their family abroad in a direct transaction to the merchant, instead of sending money that needs to be picked up. With Unalivio, users create a ticket that can be shared and paid from around the world. The payer uses local currency through a cash-in partner, or crypto. Once the payment is verified, the system notifies all parties involved and transfers USDC to the vendor account. To complete the loop, vendors review transactions, administrative details and withdraw funds as USDC on Stellar.

Not long ago, I received a worrisome phone call from my friend Luis in Dubai. He intended to pay $2,000 USD for his father’s surgery in Venezuela, but his Zelle was blocked when he attempted to make the transfer! The bank blocked the transaction because it decided this was an unauthorized use, even though everything was ready! The doctor, hospital, nurses, and of course his father!! Because they were in a part of the world that is not connected to the USD financial system, they had to go through time consuming hurdles in order to use their own money in a life-or-death situation. He called me because he remembered what we are building with Unalivio, and within minutes we did the cash in, created an account for the doctor’s office and let them receive confirmation of funds. Thankfully Luis’ dad is ok, and we got reassurance of WHY we are building these solutions.

Each year 138 Billion Dollars are sent to LatAm; and in Venezuela, our sandbox market, 7 million migrants sent 4.5 Billion Dollars in remittances in 2023. And for traditional retailers, making online transactions is hard, and making cross border transactions is almost impossible!

At the core of our system, we use USDC on Stellar to move funds around Latam with this stablecoin. We collect funds from around LatAm with our network of Stellar anchor, Crypto payment cash in, and other payment rails, convert them into USDC and pay our affiliated merchants on USDC. We also expand Stellar's use case by enabling cash-in payments with USDC on Stellar at hundreds of locations, creating a tool that is both valuable and sustainable real-world problem-solving.

To grow and incentivize usage, we are implementing a counter system to measure and analyze incentives. As part of our launch we tested discounts and cashbacks for payments. We will be launching direct integration into wallets as our pilot integration into Beans App, because we want to incentivize the thousands of users they have with Venezuelan ties in order to promote Stellar payments exclusively.",,,www.unalivio.com,https://github.com/ernestocontrer/SFC-15Tracker,https://youtu.be/Fm5vGiLpR7s,,,,,,,"Ernesto Contreras , fabians19, Yenderlhy Zapata ",,,https://x.com/somosunalivio,,

This ecosystem aims to provide Latin Americans with a personalized financial experience, allowing them to keep up with the new wave of adoption of the 3D internet.

THE HUB

The HUB is the home of virtual creators, offering a platform called Citizens Portal to upload, deploy, and manage Interoperable 3D User-Generated Content (UGC). Our goal is to empower creators to fully unleash their creativity. By leveraging tokenization, we add verifiable ownership and open up new monetization opportunities for our Citizens.

VIIO

VIIO is building a financial ecosystem transforming the financial landscape for Latin Americans, starting with Colombia. We provide a global account to maintain USDC, enabling our users to save, spend, and hedge against currency devaluation. The deployment of the application will focus on doing an activation campaign specifically aimed at the Latin American Community of VIIO. The app will allow VIIO users and other Stellar community members to mint a randomised, interoperable 3D avatars from a collection of 5000 characters, which will allow them to get to know the Stellar community and its ecosystem in a gamified way. It will be structured in the following way:

Launch the Stellar Citizens and THE HUB Citizens Portal for all VIIO users and Stellar community members, enabling users to create and manage their digital avatars, which will be minted as NFTs on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban.

Promote VIIO and the Stellar avatars in Latin America through a marketing and engagement campaign, emphasising the benefits of saving in US dollars, the security features of VIIO, and the uniqueness of having a digital avatar as well as using the Stellar blockchain.

Benefits for Stellar: The platform will serve as a public good for the Stellar ecosystem by providing a tool focused on the interoperability and standardization of uploading, deploying, and managing all future 3D collections on-chain. It utilizes the VRM interoperability standard for the creation, customization, and management of avatars, characters, and vehicles. This standardization facilitates seamless integration and interaction across different virtual environments, platforms and games, thereby enhancing the standardization at the metadata level of such NFTs while making them fully interoperable. The platform is designed with an administrator and editor mode, both available to the entire Stellar developer community. The administrator mode enables content creators to generate and deploy their own 3D campaigns. It also allows campaign creators to add items, wearables, and other assets to existing collections, enhancing the possibilities for customization and monetization of 3D NFT campaigns. Additionally, the editor mode enables owners of NFTs from a collection to edit their avatars, characters, or vehicles.

Architecture

Avatar Stellar Asset Issuance

Asset Issuer Account: A dedicated issuer account will be responsible for creating these unique avatar assets

Custom Asset: Each avatar will be represented as a unique asset on Stellar.

IPFS Integration:

IPFS will store immutable metadata for each avatar. Each avatar asset on Stellar will reference its corresponding metadata on IPFS, through an attached memo to the issuance transaction.

Wearables Database (Wearables DB):

Media Storage: This database will store VRM files and other media data related to avatar customization

URL Exposure: Media items will be accessible via URLs, allowing easy integration with the Avatar Module and Metadata Service.

Avatar Database (Avatar DB):

Avatar Data Management: This database will store data specific to each Stellar avatar asset, such as current wearables and customization options.

Metadata Service:

Metadata Service: is meant to manage the whole metadata logic for avatar NFTs, interacting with IPFS, Avatar Contract, Avatar DB, Wearables DB and UI

Avatar Module:

Avatar Module is the app the final user is supposed to interact with to manage their own avatars

The trade finance gap is $2.5T worldwide, and we are focusing on the maritime industry in SEA which represents a $500B gap with annual growth of 9.6% (https://www.adb.org/publications/2023-trade-finance-gaps-growth).

These SMEs are underserved by the traditional financial institutions, experience tight cashflow, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. These SMEs face tight cashflow problems because they have short-term needs for the money, but customers will only pay them after anywhere between 30-90 days. With invoice financing / freight factoring, these SMEs get upfront funding thus freeing them for important things such as paying their employees on time, rent, etc.

The BorderDollar platform involves two stakeholders: investors, and businesses.

Investor-facing platform: Investors refer to individuals who want to finance invoices in exchange for a certain amount of returns, i.e. between 8-14% APR. Here on the investor-facing side, investors connect their wallets, choose a liquidity pool/campaign to fund, and how much they want to fund. Our value proposition to investors is that they are investing in an underserved, neglected, and most importantly orthogonal to regular assets. We appeal to non-degens who wish to make a difference for underbanked SMEs and prefer stable regularly timed returns over staking-type projects with short-lived high returns.

Business-facing platform: SMEs which require cash will upload their invoices, and we will assess these invoices internally before putting them up for funding by funders. On this end of the platform, businesses undergo KYC. They will then receive 70-80% of their invoices' value in fiat using an off-ramp service. For example, when we onboard SMEs from the Philippines, we can use Moneygram for money transfers from the liquidity pool to fiat because of their collaboration with Circle and Stellar (https://www.moneygram.com/intl/stellarwallets).

These invoices will initially be assessed manually through SME owner interviews and due diligence, along with our risk scorecard. In the future, we will integrate machine learning for automated risk assessments for scalability.

Copperx Payout: Copperx Payout is a pioneering global payout solution designed specifically for Web3 businesses. It enables seamless, efficient, and compliant transactions to employees, contractors, and vendors in over 50 countries.

Problem We Solve: Web3 businesses are struggling to move between crypto and fiat, and to pay salaries to their global teams or vendors. They can't even get a bank account due to current regulations. Web3 companies have to set up multiple entities for fund movement, which we can avoid if we solve global payouts.

Integration on Stellar: We are developing contracts for accepting payments and facilitating offramps via international remittances. Our partnerships with Bridge, Circle, and regional offramp providers ensure minimal cost crypto-to-fiat conversions.

We have seen though that users would love to use their Beans balance to directly spend their funds in shops. This would mean they don’t have to withdraw and keep their funds in a more stable currency for longer. We are excited to add support for prepaid cards in Europe, LATAM and Africa. This will mean that users will keep their funds in the app (and on Stellar) for a longer period and will mean a significant increase in utility. It aligns really well with our vision that blockchain based wallets have the potential to look and feel similar to normal centralized banking services.

To add prepaid cards, we are looking to work with our card partner to leverage existing SEP’s like SEP 10 and SEP 6 and 12. By building on top of these standards it will be easier to maintain and the functionality will become available to the broader ecosystem easily as well. As cards need some additional features around card management, we are looking to build this in a way that has the potential to become a new “card standard”. In future iterations we might shift from prepaid cards to debit cards by using Soroban. This is something closely related to our ambitions to shift towards a smart wallet architecture.

We have previously done a proof-of-concept with very easy to use lending pool functionality inside Beans, through an integration with Blend. To take this into production, we require features like earnings management, multi procotol support, automated pool balancing and safety mechanisms. We were planning to build this ourselves, however, our direction changed after connecting with Paltalabs during the Consensus 2024 hackathon. Paltalabs showcased an idea that closely aligned with our needs. They expressed interest in further developing DeFindex in cooperation with us, offering substantial benefits by offloading the development of critical features to Paltalabs. Most of the work done on our Blend proof-of-concept can be reused or adapted to align with the DeFindex protocol. Additionally, we will develop a DeFindex adapter for the Blend lending pool that can be used by everyone in the Stellar ecosystem. To build the integration, we will build a Blend adapter that connects DeFindex with Blend. This adapter can be re-used by ecosystem projects.

We have seen that the onboarding flow can be a bit long for some users and SMS authentication is not the best fallback authtentication option in all countries. That’s why we are looking for other authentication options. Secondly, we see a lot of potential when we shift towards a smart wallet infrastructure. The first step in that direction is working with passkeys for account recovery. We are super excited by the ease of use of password less account recovery and looking to use passkeys for seemless account creation and recovery. A first step in this direction is by addin passkeys to our SEP 30 authentication options. After that, in future rounds we will be able to explore smart-wallet infrastructure changes in more detail. Here we expect to run into challenges like compatability with existing SEP's, sending from C addresses to G addressses, offering cross-currency swaps etc.",,,www.beansapp.com,https://github.com/Beans-BV,https://www.loom.com/share/f93a11d54ccf41f5b368f8eea1d9a9b9,,,,,,,"Jop Middelkamp, Wouter Arkink",,,https://twitter.com/BeansApp,https://beansapp.medium.com/,

All processes are automated and handled in the backend, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

The Problem:

High fees & hidden costs: Traditional money transfers often charge high transaction fees, have hidden markup charges, and offer unfavorable exchange rates.

Slow payment processing: On average, most remittance services take at least a day. There are also often delays caused by individual stakeholders like banks making the process inefficient.

The Market:
The remittance market, particularly for transfers from the US to India, represents a significant and exponentially growing sector. India is the world's largest recipient of remittances, receiving over $125 billion in 2023 alone. These are our 2 main user segments:
1. Large Expatriate Population: The Indian expatriate community in the US is substantial and continuously growing, creating a steady demand for reliable and affordable remittance services.
2. Freelancers and Merchants: There is a growing segment of freelancers and merchants who require efficient and fast payment solutions for cross-border transactions.

There was a survey conducted by zero-hash and light payment which revealed significant frustration with traditional payment systems. Here are the challenges freelancers face with traditional payments:

Speed:
48% experience delays in getting paid.
75% want payments within 24 hours; 45% desire real-time payments.

Costs:
49% find fees high and impacting their earnings.
18% say fees significantly affect their income.

Stellar Integration:
SendIN is built on the Stellar network to leverage its advantages of low transaction fees and almost instant settlement times. This integration ensures that our users benefit from fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, making SendIN a highly efficient remittance platform. Here’s how we are utilizing Stellar's core features:

Stellar Anchors:
- Kado: In the US, we will use Kado as our on-ramp service to convert fiat currency to USDC on the Stellar network. Kado is a Stellar anchor that adheres to SEP-0006 (deposit and withdrawal operations) and SEP-0024 (interactive deposits and withdrawals).
- Onramp.money: In India, we will utilize Onramp.money to off-ramp USDC into INR, directly transferring the funds to users’ Indian bank accounts. Onramp.money ensures that the conversion and transfer process is smooth and compliant with local regulations.

SDK / Soroban Integration: Our proof-of-concept (POC) currently uses the Stellar-JS SDK for transaction handling and network interactions. We plan to transition to using Soroban smart contracts for automating and securing our transactions. By utilizing Soroban, we can reduce the risk of errors and fraud and will also automate transactions.

SEP-0012 Standard: Our KYC service will adhere to the SEP-0012 standard, which outlines the requirements for KYC data exchange. We will use the KYC API provided by Stellar.

This solution leverages the robustness and security of Stellar's blockchain to provide enterprises with an efficient, secure, and seamless way to manage and process their cross-border payments.

Enterprise Privacy Concerns

Challenge Solved
The industry has privacy concerns about disclosing a single company address for all payments, which can reveal sensitive financial information. Bitcoin wallets such as XPUB allow separate addresses per customer or invoice, but they have limitations, such as relying on the payee for payment amount input and lacking smart contract controls. In the EVM ecosystem, using HD wallets for privacy is challenging due to a lack of user-friendly exposure.

Bitwave Solution
Bitwave Payments recognizes the significance of privacy in financial transactions. To enhance privacy and security, we use smart contracts and account abstraction. Our approach helps eliminate the requirement of a single address for all payments, adding an extra layer of control. With Bitwave's solution, businesses can specify the token amount to exchange, ensuring precise and secure payments. Our solution integrates smart contract functionalities to safeguard financial information and streamline payments for businesses in the blockchain ecosystem.

Streamlined Approval Workflows

Challenge Solved
Approval payment processes can be cumbersome, especially in environments that require strict compliance and control. Manual approval workflows are prone to errors and can slow down financial operations.

Bitwave Solution
Bitwave automates and secures the workflow process, simplifying the management of role-based permissions and reducing the complexity of approvals. This ensures enterprise-grade access control while delivering rapid insights to financial teams and eliminating manual errors.

Seamless Invoice Payments

Challenge Solved
Traditional cryptocurrency payments can be cumbersome, requiring multiple steps and systems. The lack of integration with existing financial systems often leads to fragmented visibility and payment control.

Bitwave Solution
Bitwave Payments lets businesses quickly initiate and complete bulk payments from their non-custodial wallet to vendors. It seamlessly integrates with existing accounting software and systems.

Flexible Pricing Rules

Challenge Solved
Handling invoices in multiple denominations, especially in a mix of fiat and crypto, complicates accounting and financial reporting. It also adds to the workload due to the need for constant recalculations based on volatile crypto prices.

Bitwave Solution
Bitwave's pricing engine supports invoices in any denomination and automates pricing rules, significantly reducing manual workload. This flexibility and automation simplify accounting for crypto transactions, even during volatility.

Minimized Costs

Challenge Solved
Traditional payment and financial reporting operations are often separated, resulting in higher costs for reconciliation, customer service, and transaction processing.

Bitwave Solution
Bitwave consolidates these operations, reducing costs and providing a seamless financial experience across the enterprise's financial stack. This consolidation results in more efficient operations and cost savings.

Simplified Vendor Onboarding

The admin account of the oracle smart contract always has all node public keys as co-signers with >50% multisig threshold, so more than half of the oracle backing nodes have to agree on a transaction in order to store price feed data or modify oracle contract state.

Each node independently calculates the values of quoted prices using deterministic idempotent algorithms to ensure consistency, generates the update transaction, signs it with the node's private key, and shares it with other peer nodes via WebSocket protocol. If for some reason (ledger access delay, failing connection, version incompatibility, adversary attack) any given node quotes a token/asset price different from other nodes, the transaction hash will not match the hash generated by the majority, so the transaction won't make it into the ledger. This way Reflector utilizes Stellar protocol underlying security to implement an uncomplicated yet robust consensus, which guarantees reliability, fault tolerance, and regular price feed updates.

For on-chain Stellar assets price feed data retrieval, Reflector relies on a quorum of nodes connected to Stellar validators. Each node fetches trades information directly from the Stellar Core database. Price feeds for generic tokens get updated in a similar fashion, but nodes have to agree on information pulled from external sources (CEX/DEX API, price aggregators, stock exchanges, derivative platforms, etc.)

Other contracts interact with the oracle contract, retrieving data stored by Reflector nodes. Consumers can fetch historical ranges, use cross-price calculation, utilize TWAP averaging, or simply pull the most recent token price depending on the use-case.

Components:

Reflector node: Fetches prices, maintains p2p communication with other nodes, and publishes price updates signed by the quorum.

Oracle smart contract: Contract implementation that incorporates consumer-facing interface with admin functionality.

Contract JavaScript bindings: Provides convenient JS wrappers for interaction with the contract from JS runtime.

0xAuth,SCF #29,0xAuth,0xAuth,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recsAQHCghw9HIUvF,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$90000.00,$90000.00,903278.90,8/9/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,0xAuth will enable seamless compliance andinteroperability for tokenised funds.,"The Problem
Traditional finance is moving on-chain, as evidenced by Franklin Templeton, KKR, and BlackRock launching tokenised funds. However, onboarding and verification processes are still manual and repetitive, leading to a high abandonment rate (40% if over ten minutes [1]) and significant potential revenue loss ($3.3 trillion in 2019 [2]). There is a critical need for a seamless, compliant Web3 onboarding process with portable credentials.

What Problems Are Tokenised Fund Institutions Facing?
To stay competitive, institutions must keep investor fees low, driving many to move on-chain. However, high compliance costs due to repetitive, siloed processes create inefficiencies, reducing investor mobility, increasing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC), and hindering operational efficiency. Additionally, tokenised funds operate in a gated manner, limiting potential investors. A cross-chain approach could significantly expand the investor base.

What Are We Proposing?

0xAuth aims to provide a frictionless onboarding and verification process with portable investor credentials, boasting minimal compliance costs. Key features include:

Automated Verification: 0xAuth uses trusted off-chain oracles for automated verification of accredited investors, including KYC, KYB, AML compliance, and PEP screening via Plaid and Vezgo.

Portable Credentials: A digital identity contract (ERC-734) is deployed on-chain, and users are issued verifiable credentials both off-chain (W3C VC standard) and on-chain (ERC-735 standard).

Conditional Wallet Connectivity: Platforms can verify user eligibility by integrating with 0xAuth and checking their verifiable credentials to conditionally allow or block access.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Platforms can use JSON-LD-based ZKPs for selective disclosure of user information, allowing verification without revealing entire identities.

Future Plans: Implement on-chain verification of off-chain credentials using ZKP verifier contracts (which support criteria selection via ZK predicates) on the Stellar network.

How Does Stellar Fit into the Picture?

We envision 0xAuth as the single sign-on (SSO) for a seamless, yet fully compliant, Web3 ecosystem. Our solution eliminates the need for siloed and gated environments typical in tokenised funds. With an eye toward a multi-chain future, 0xAuth is designed to facilitate the effortless movement of eligible investors across different blockchain networks while enabling institutions to attract and engage users from these diverse ecosystems.

Incorporating support for Stellar-based tokenised funds into 0xAuth is a strategic move. By doing so, we aim to significantly expand the pool of potential investors for institutions like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, which are already utilising Stellar. Our included illustrations depict the envisioned integration and the benefits it brings.

How Can Stellar Benefit From Our Solution?

Enhanced Interoperability: 0xAuth enables seamless identity verification across blockchains, positioning Stellar as a bridge within the multi-chain ecosystem.

Compliance as a Service: 0xAuth’s tools simplify compliance for tokenised funds, making Stellar a compliance hub for cross-chain RWA transactions.

Market Expansion: Reducing compliance friction in cross-chain transactions attracts more institutional participants and eligible investors, boosting Stellar's ecosystem activity and liquidity.

Exclusive Features: We plan to develop custom features for Stellar on 0xAuth, including institutional dashboards, audit trails, and enhanced security protocols tailored for institutional users.

By enabling these capabilities, 0xAuth will help solidify Stellar's role as a leading network for tokenised assets, broadening its user base and enhancing its operational ecosystem.

As a result, many of these developers in the coming months and years will likely be new to Soroban and Rust. To support Soroban developers in conceptualizing and writing smart contracts, we are developing an AI-powered smart contract generation assistant. This assistant will possess agentic capabilities, enabling it to gather the necessary information and deliver a smart contract project ready for review, testing, and iteration on the Testnet.

We have already developed a proof-of-concept Soroban-specific system which successfully outputs complete robust Soroban smart contracts with little errors. You can find a video of how it works in the Drive. The code generated by the assistant should be viewed not as a final product but as a robust foundation for the project.

This tool will significantly accelerate the development process. The idea is to add another catalyst in the development workflow that further “Sorobinices” the Stellar “Abacus,” code-included as much as batteries included. In a rapidly growing system still in its infancy, we aim to provide a multiplier that effectively drives feedback and fosters growth.

The Soroban AIssistant is a web-app that runs in the background on an AI agentic system specifically designed and tailored to the creation of Soroban Smart Contracts. It will allow Soroban developers to describe in depth the problem they are trying to solve in a conversational way and the assistant will ask all necessary questions to collect the information it needs to proceed.

By compiling and vectorizing all available information on Soroban (including Stellar’s documentation, APIs, Github code libraries…) as well as the Smart contracts that have been deployed on Github, the whole model is solely focused on being a tool Soroban developers can use to accelerate the conceptualization and creation of smart contracts.

The agentic flow consists of 3 main stages. We will provide a high-level overview of the whole process here, but you can find the full detail and deep dive in the technical architecture, where you will be able to find all details on the different agents and how the system interacts given that it is a deep-tech project.

Understanding Phase and Initial proposal creation: The first part of the flow is aimed at fully understanding what the user is trying to solve or build, gathering comprehensive user inputs and converting them into a coherent problem statement. Then, considering all available options to tackle it and merge all user inputs together with the vectorized database of Soroban, Stellar, and Rust knowledge to conceptualize a potential solution.

Refinement phase: Propose and refine an initial design using specialized AI modules. This phase focuses on integrating expert inputs and iterative improvements to ensure the design is robust and ready for development.

Building the Smart Contract: Construct, review, and document the smart contract based on the refined design. Output zip folder with project files and folders for testing.

The user will receive a zip file with all project files and a .md document with comments and explanations, fully documenting every step of the process, decisions made, and so they can navigate the code much easier.

Deployment and Testing: After this, the developer can directly upload and test the smart contracts on the testnet and by utilizing a tool such as the Okashi.dev playground, they can start building on top of that foundation. It is key to highlight that as the Soroban ecosystem develops, more data will be available, and together with the exponential improvements LLMs are experiencing, the Soroban AIssistant will also keep improving exponentially. This will widely help the ecosystem grow and increase the accessibility to developing on Soroban.

We have many ideas of improvement for the coming months such as outputting also the server-side Python and Javascript files, chatting with the docs, and possibly giving access to more specific agents that fulfill a single role very well. For example, a Security auditor or an oracle creator.",,,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YfJ9zZ5IDnr77XOHM5kpiLzO_5wmafb?usp=sharing,https://github.com/luisao8/Soroban-code-AIssistant.git,https://youtu.be/DweOiegwH5o,,,,,,,"Ignacio, Sergio Rodriguez Valbuena, Alejandro Taboada Esteban, Luis Alarcón de la Lastra",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/missio-ia,,,

Sorobook is an indexer with an integrated API server that collects Soroban transaction data and event data to provide feature-rich queries to Dapps in a clean, user-friendly format, along with sufficient documentation. Given what we have to offer, many Dapps could utilize our product to greatly enhance their UI/UX in terms of performance and utility. With that being said, there is still plenty of room to improve, most notably to support contract state and contract calls data. Though it's what is needed by most Dapps, existing API solutions don't have it as it is complicated to implement (requires complex data processing and efficient data management). That's why we want to introduce the next version of Sorobook so that we can include these needed functionalities.

Solarkraft,SCF #29,Solarkraft,Solarkraft,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recTmGxt9atX6ovnz,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$67000.00,$67000.00,665792.85,8/8/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,Runtime monitoring for Soroban smart contracts to aid developers and auditors in finding critical bugs before and in production,"The product. Solarkraft is a runtime monitoring tool of Soroban smart contracts. It tests whether on-chain invocations of the smart contract conform to a developer-written monitor specification, and flags deviations. Runtime monitoring applies to all phases of the engineering lifecycle and aids developers, auditors, and users. Importantly, Solarkraft monitors are small snippets of code, not a monolithic specification. This makes them more accessible formal artifacts than usual. We provide additional details in the Technical Architecture document.

The problem. Smart contracts are backing billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies. At the same time, smart contracts are notoriously difficult to get right. One reason for that is that the code of the smart contracts is immutable, that is, they cannot be quickly patched once deployed on mainnet. Another reason is that smart contracts are often written using an agile framework, where the requirements are figured out on-the-go, often by writing unit tests and integration tests. As a result, the expected behavior is poorly documented, if at all. The most common engineering practices (manual specification and code review, testing, security audits) are problematic in that they involve a lot of (incomplete) guessing, thus allowing critical bugs to sneak into production. Formal methods promise to deliver hard guarantees about the correctness of software. Even though we observe that formal methods enjoy stronger adoption in web3 than in web2, the use of formal methods is still quite limited in the blockchain space. In our experience, this is because formal specification is too far removed from an engineer's day-to-day practice.

Our solution. Solarkraft takes a middle ground between practical engineering methods and Formal Methods. Our goal is to connect and harden smart contract development and auditing via runtime monitoring backed by formal methods. We take into account our learnings from Atomkraft, the model-based testing tool that we developed for the Cosmos ecosystem in 2022, but propose the following novel and unique features:

We propose to write multiple modular monitor specifications for individual features, as opposed to a monolithic specification of the entire contract behavior. These are easier to write, read, and verify. Moreover, there is a good chance of reuse.

We map contract values to specification values, which is known as “abstraction”. This will be easier and more natural to do than mapping specification values to contract values, which is known as “concretization”.

Solarkraft integrates well into the development process. This brings immediate value to engineers. They can both test their contracts and observe monitor alerts in the development stage, and keep running the same monitors after contract deployment.

Solarkraft will be of value to contract auditors too. Auditors often have limited time frames for discovering security bugs (in contrast to malicious actors!). Drawing from our experience in auditing projects in the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, it is quite challenging to write a complete specification that faithfully represents a collection of contracts (though we managed to do that in a few cases). With the approach outlined in this proposal, abnormal contract behavior can be discovered much faster, by writing simpler abstract monitor specifications.

Integration with Stellar. When it comes to developing sustainable tooling, we believe in value-driven development:

To this end, our proposal for this Community Award is to engage with the Soroban community to collaborate on a real-life case study and support it in Solarkraft (e.g., with Blend, Phoenix, Soroswap, Xyclones, etc). Since Solarkraft is open source, we expect the learnings to benefit the entire Soroban developer community.

We will also address test generation for Soroban smart contracts, similar to a fuzzer. This generator will use the monitor specifications as guidance to generate both successful and failing test cases, similar to how we did it with Atomkraft. In contrast to Atomkraft, where we generated inputs for long executions of large specifications, Solarkraft will take a different approach: we generate inputs for a single step of the synchronous product of simple monitor specifications. This approach should scale much better than the standard bounded model checking of large specifications.

Immediate value is also generated by performing security audits. Our team could use Solarkraft in the future to audit Soroban contracts. Since Solarkraft is open source, we expect other auditing teams to get value out of it as well.

Why Stellar? Stellar is appealing because of the technical maturity of its ecosystem. We appreciate the thoughtfulness with which Stellar has been designed and implemented.

While smart contract development on Stellar has taken many leaps forward since I wrote about it six years ago, the barriers to entry are still numerous... it's an intimidating field only the most technically savvy (or at least the most curious learners) can break into. Put simply, developing smart contracts is hard.

Specifically:

While Rust (the most well supported Soroban SDK) is one of the most admired languages, it is far from one of the most popular.

More mature and seasoned smart contract platforms are complicated and error prone.

Thus, how can we help existing developers succeed? Even more importantly, how can we lower the barrier to entry for community newcomers? And as a stretch, how easy can we make it for non-technical folks to participate and even create their own smart contracts?

Today, various tools exist to solve this problem. Grouped generally, there are a few approaches:

Allow folks to use the programming language they are most familiar with (Hyperledger Fabric)

Give folks the best damn developer experience possible (Stellar with: all SDF Soroban tooling, SCF participants like Okashi, etc.)

Provide a set of re-usable, well vetted, well tested, and well understood boiler-plate, templated smart contracts (tons of this in the Ethereum ecosystem, a few SCF projects, etc.)

We propose a fourth approach: making the smart contract language itself more approachable.

The Solution

With the above problem in mind, consider the following:

65% of the general population are visual learners.

Scratch is an incredible first language, in fact it’s also more popular than Rust.

Digicus is a block-based Soroban native, smart contract programming language complete with an easy to use, low-code IDE. It attempts to leverage the existing programming on-boarding paradigms to give folks an opportunity to get their hands dirty while also requiring only the minimal amount of technical expertise to get started; we want Stellar developers to be writing contracts without requiring them to understand Rust, investigate WASM binaries, etc. Many schools (from elementary to college) use Scratch in their coding 101 class for exactly this reason!

Once folks become familiar with smart contracts via Digicus, there are two paths forward:

Transition to using the SDF supported Rust SDK (Digicus can target the Rust SDK so this transition can initially be a hybrid). This is akin to CS-201 where folks begin to use languages like Python and Java to learn data structures and algorithms.

Adopt Digicus as the IDE and programming language of choice for Soroban smart contract development. In this case, we will work to adopt and integrate into the IDE other community initiatives, projects, and efforts such as vulnerability analysis frameworks, auto-complete tooling, etc.

Existing, similar solutions in the blockchain space include:

SmartBuilder (very similar to what we're proposing here, built for Hyperledger)

Toolblox (Ethereum)

Blocks Editor (unsure what chain)

The Audience

There are a few audiences we target:

[primary] net new members to the Soroban developer community

[primary] existing, less technically savvy members of the Soroban developer community

[secondary] existing, technically savvy members of the Stellar developer community who have only just started experimenting with Soroban

While we might see Soroban power users adopt our tooling, we are not (at least initially) developing with this community in mind.

Onboarding

Digicus is a beginner friendly tool for developing smart contracts. Beginner here means many things:
1. no tools need to be downloaded (folks will be able to do all development in browser)
2. there is no specific programming language learning (or even that much programming knowledge) as a pre-requisite
3. for more tech savvy folks, it offers a natural progression. Folks can begin investigating the generated code (i.e. the contract in Rust) and decide to begin writing contracts in a supported programming language of their choice

Thus, we will promote it as a beginner smart contract creation tool.

We will investigate a few avenues to do so:
1. generate our own tutorial/""how to"" content in various forms (video, blog post, etc.)
2. work with SDF to incorporate it into the official tutorial documentation (at some point once it is feature complete)
3. actually use it ourselves, proving it is functional for real use cases

For folks new to the ecosystem, we'd expect them to learn about Digicus via avenues (1) and (2). For existing folks in the ecosystem, they may also learn about Digicus via (1) and (2) but also potentially (3); maybe they are a Ruby developer at heart and have been frustrated by the Rust language/toolchain, waiting for a simpler way to develop smart contracts.",,,https://www.digicus.dev/,https://github.com/robertDurst/digicus,,,,,,,,Robert Durst,,,,,

SSApps are decentralized applications built on top of Calimero's peer-2-peer infrastructure, where users have full ownership over their data.

Data is incredibly valuable, powering progress and innovation. Yet, it's often collected and used in ways that might surprise you, raising privacy concerns. At Calimero Network, we argue that users should be in full control of their data, ensuring privacy, security, and autonomy over their personal information and interactions within the network. Additionally, as digital interactions become increasingly important in both personal and professional contexts, there is a growing need for solutions that provide enhanced security, privacy, and data ownership.

Our goal is for Calimero to become a Layer 0 for Private Data in the Stellar ecosystem. We recognize the strong linkage between blockchain technology and off-chain compute, and would love to see developers building use cases on Calimero’s infrastructure, such as Private DAOs, Private Finance, Private Social, Edge Computing on user devices (mobile, PC, and browsers) where private data is closer to the source (user), while all the immutable and trustless execution happens on Stellar.

To make our vision true, we have developed a framework that empowers developers with tools like the Protocol SDK for defining application-specific communication rules and the Client SDK for seamless interaction with the network, alongside a specialized compute market for executing demanding tasks. The network's architecture supports peer-to-peer encrypted data streams, ensuring verifiability, data privacy, and security. Calimero Network stands out by offering localized consensus, which contrasts with traditional global consensus models, allowing for scalable and efficient application performance without sacrificing user privacy. Intended for developers seeking to create privacy-preserving applications and users desiring control over their data, Calimero Network promises a decentralized computing environment where privacy is paramount, and data remains under the user's control hosted on their local device.

Later in this proposal, we dive deeper into the specific technical integration with Stellar in the question regarding the technical architecture. Additionally, we will break down the roadmap into 3 major milestones. While this proposal’s scope captures integration with Stellar, followed by a joint hackathon, afterwards we plan to integrate with projects building on Stellar to further promulgate the privacy-preserving narrative within the Stellar ecosystem.",,,https://www.calimero.network/,https://github.com/calimero-network/core,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JO0uPA4UY07Vh1jU_TF-26Rh17Jgu8Cx/view,,,,,,,"coach_saveznik , coach_saveznik",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/calimero-network/,https://x.com/CalimeroNetwork,https://discord.gg/kjP4GrafXj,

Through its multifaceted approach, the program aims to transform these individuals into skilled professionals and innovators in the blockchain space.

Events in the West Africa Ambassadors Program play a crucial role in promoting projects built on Stellar, particularly those utilizing Soroban smart contracts. These gatherings serve as dynamic platforms where developers can showcase their applications through detailed presentations and engaging live demonstrations. By highlighting successful projects, these events encourage broader adoption of Stellar’s technologies and demonstrate practical uses in solving local issues. Each event is carefully structured to maximize exposure for developers, allowing them to present their blockchain solutions to an audience that includes potential investors, industry leaders, and future users. This exposure is instrumental in securing feedback, fostering partnerships, and attracting necessary funding. Additionally, these events offer valuable case studies and success stories that illustrate the tangible benefits and impact of using Stellar and Soroban in real-world applications. Moreover, the community-centric atmosphere of these events encourages networking and collaboration among participants. This environment fosters a supportive ecosystem where developers can connect, share insights, and collaborate on future projects. Such interactions not only enhance individual projects but also strengthen the overall capacity of the local blockchain community to innovate and address regional challenges effectively.

The coding classes within the program are integral to preparing ambassadors for these events. By focusing on the technical workings of the Stellar SDK and the Rust programming language, essential for crafting smart contracts on Soroban, ambassadors gain a deep understanding of Stellar's infrastructure. This knowledge equips them to host discussions and presentations about Stellar's technical interworkings at events, enhancing their ability to educate and engage audiences effectively. Participants start with a fundamental understanding of blockchain technology and progressively tackle more complex topics, including smart contract deployment and optimization on the Stellar network. This structured educational approach ensures that by the end of the program, attendees are not only well-versed in theoretical concepts but also competent in applying them to develop practical, scalable solutions.",,,discord.gg/stellardev,,,,,,,,,david ogoegbunem,,,,,

We are Women Biz, a latin community created by women to empower women through web3. We organize events and educational programs to promote Blockchain adoption through web2 to web3 onboarding. With a diverse community with over 1800 members across 16 countries, we have created an environment that promotes education, collaboration, and empowerment within the blockchain industry. These engagements have served as crucibles of learning and interaction, facilitating knowledge exchange and fostering a supportive ecosystem for women navigating the complexities of Web3. Our experience includes organizing over 50 IRL events and hosting over 30 online workshops, providing valuable opportunities for learning and networking. Notable highlights include our successful “Women in Web3” bootcamp, which attracted 190 women participants and received over 400 quest submissions as well as our “Latina Blockchain Hackathon” that produced 21 innovative projects.

What problem do we identify? Today's financial systems are often inaccessible, inefficient, and costly, particularly for individuals and businesses in underserved and developing regions. Traditional financial services can be exclusive, slow, and burdened with high fees. Additionally, according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and POCLab gender diversity research results published in 2023, women make up only about 27% of the Web3 workforce, often in non-technical roles. Only 13% of Web3 founding teams include a woman, and only 3% have teams that are exclusively made up of women. This significant gender gap further limits the potential for innovation and inclusion in the blockchain space.

Our solution Recognizing the potential of Stellar to transform financial systems, we propose a DeFi-focused bootcamp to educate and empower individuals to leverage Stellar for decentralized finance applications. The Stellar Women Bootcamp is a 4-week, gamified educational program designed to equip Latin women with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and utilize decentralized finance solutions on the Stellar network.

Online Learn-to-Earn Activities: The main focus of Soroban Samba, developers will face weekly challenges to win prizes. These challenges will be revealed each Monday, and participants will have a few days to complete them. The challenges will be individual and graded by difficulty levels (junior, mid-level, senior). Each weekly batch will have rewards distributed to everyone who completes the challenges according to the level of difficulty. These challenges will prepare participants to build various integrations and products within Soroban, including financial solutions, DeFi integrations, on-ramps and off-ramps, and more. This experience will bring significant traction to the Soroban Community in Brazil. Also we believe there are many excellent projects within Soroban, though most currently have low traction. To address this, we will include strategies to engage future Soroban developers and our audience with Soroban apps and DApps through gamified experiences with prizes. The idea is to reward every participant.

Focus Areas: Financial Solutions: Developing applications for payments, remittances, or decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. DeFi Integrations: Creating DeFi solutions such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, or yield farming tools. On-Ramps and Off-Ramps: Building tools to facilitate the conversion of fiat to crypto and vice versa. Social Impact Projects: Creating applications that address social issues like transparency in charity, voting systems, or identity verification.

Benefits of Online Learn-to-Earn Activities for Stellar: Increased Developer Engagement, Accelerated Ecosystem Growth, Community Building, Enhanced Visibility and Adoption, Quality Assurance, Innovation and Problem-Solving. By implementing Online Learn-to-Earn activities, Stellar can significantly enhance its ecosystem, attract and retain talented developers, and ensure sustained growth and innovation.

Online Coding Classes: During Soroban Samba, each week will feature its own coding challenges. To prepare developers for these activities, coding classes will dive deep into Soroban code and explain various ways to complete each challenge. These classes are crucial for understanding the structure of Soroban coding. Additionally, during Soroban week, all Brazilian Stellar projects will be invited to showcase their solutions and share their personal experiences building on Soroban. In total, we expect to offer more than 10 hours of content, crafted in Portuguese and focused on builders. We aim for participants not only to build but also to interact with applications in the ecosystem, using wallets, exchanges, on-ramps, off-ramps, and more.

Support for Developers: Support is crucial as hundreds of developers will participate in Soroban Samba. A technical team with substantial knowledge about Soroban will be available within our community to assist developers with specific needs, including screen sharing and personalized guidance. This dedicated support will ensure that all participants can effectively navigate challenges and maximize their development potential.

In Summary: We expect 1,000 developers to participate in Soroban Samba, resulting in the deployment of over 2,000 contracts. Senior participants will be incentivized and supported to build their own products on Soroban. This comprehensive support and encouragement will help foster innovation and growth within the Soroban ecosystem. Our team is committed to achieving transformative results.

We will do this by expanding our existing product suite to include XLM as a collateral option for clients looking to borrow USD or stablecoins. Today, there are limited options available for XLM holders to easily use their tokens as collateral for a USD or stablecoin loan. Previous crypto lenders like BlockFi and Celsius have since gone bankrupt or are no longer operational. This implosion stemmed from a slew of risky institutional lending between these companies, which eventually took the retail lending space down with it. While there are DeFi options, these aren't ideal for many investors who are risk averse and not tech-savvy given the tax and compliance headaches, multiple layers of smart contract risk, and sub-par user experience.

A collateralized loan from Lantern will allow XLM holders to get access to dollars without having to sell their assets. This way, investors can retain upside if they are bullish on the value of XLM long-term, as well as defer capital gains taxes. In return, Lantern will custody the clients' XLM collateral in our BitGo cold storage wallets (insured up to $250MM), which will be used to cover any potential loan losses should the price of XLM fall drastically. Our loans are over-collateralized (typically around a 25-40% loan-to-value at origination), which gives Lantern ample time to allow clients to address margin calls, as well as protect the Company from losses. USD loans enter margin call once they hit a 60% LTV and will have some of their collateral force-liquidated once the loan hits 70% LTV.

Unlike previous crypto lenders like BlockFi and Celsius, Lantern will not be engaging in undercollateralized institutional lending with our clients’ crypto collateral. Previous platforms commingled client funds with other tokens on hand, which exposed their clients’ balances to outsized counterparty risk. Our product is designed to keep client collateral in a designated wallet for the life of the loan and will only be touched should the loan trigger liquidation or repayment of the loan.

Our ideal customer profile (ICP) are urban professionals usually in finance, consulting, tech, between ages of 25-45. They tend to be higher net worth with ~25-50% of their portfolio in crypto holdings, including XLM. They are finance-savvy but risk averse and uncomfortable navigating DeFi applications.

If accepted into the Stellar Community Fund program, we will use the funds to build out the necessary infrastructure required to accept XLM as collateral for USD loans, including the auto-liquidation functionality which is critical to protect Lantern from defaulting borrowers. Any residual funds will be used to help fund the loans requested by our clients. As we continue to expand our product offering, we hope to become the most trusted and primary lending of choice for XLM users looking to borrow dollars against their holdings.",,,https://www.lantern.finance/,https://github.com/lanternfi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMCR9kzgyfc,,,,,,,Jung Won Kim,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/lantern-fi/,https://twitter.com/LanternFi,,

However, existing lending markets both lack the compliance rails to support these assets and don't have mechanisms in place to prevent liquidity fragmentation caused by different parties tokenizing the same underlying asset (e.g. there are 10+ US Treasury Bill tokens on Eth Mainnet alone).

Mystic solves this by setting KYC/KYB requirements at the asset-level, which allows us to modularly support any asset and its legal requirements (e.g. non-US investors only). Not only that, Mystic has an optimizer system in place which helps balance liquidity across assets of the same asset class (e.g. distribute liquidity amongst multiple tokens representing US Treasuries). Both of these characteristics combined make Mystic the perfect lending playground for institutions and high-networth individuals looking to leverage their real-world asset holdings.

Seeing as our current infrastructure is all Ethereum-based and EVM-focused, we lack the ability to support Stellar assets and work with Stellar-aligned asset managers, like Franklin Templeton and future ones. We are very interested in being on Stellar, as the ecosystem seems like a perfect fit with our value proposition. Hence, we are requesting this Activation Award so we may reproduce our infrastructure on Soroban and go live on Stellar!",,,https://mysticfinance.xyz,Stellar code not started yet.,https://www.loom.com/share/b297b561357f4cb2b38a3a2ed219b075?sid=1ecb1a4a-98c3-4f8e-86a1-c1484238991a,,,,,,,"kelmat, kelmat ",,,https://twitter.com/mystic_finance,,
Chrysalis,SCF #29,Chrysalis,Chrysalis,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/reclPkvuD4iqLs6E5,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$49040.00,$49040.00,577850.78,8/5/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"Chrysalis - turn Stellar assets into fluid opportunities, offering seamless liquidity and staking rewards on one dynamic platform.","Chrysalis is a liquid staking platform built on the Stellar network, designed to provide users with a seamless and efficient way to stake their XLM or ETH assets. By leveraging the power of Stellar's fast and low-cost transactions, Chrysalis enables users to convert their XLM into ETH, which is then staked on Lido, one of the most trusted staking protocols on Ethereum. This process allows users to earn passive income through staking rewards while also receiving rnETH, a representation of their staked ETH, which can be utilized within the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Chrysalis addresses several key problems:

1. Limited Staking Options on Stellar: Stellar users traditionally have fewer staking opportunities compared to other blockchain ecosystems. Chrysalis allows Stellar asset holders to convert their assets to ETH and participate in Ethereum's robust staking environment.
2. Illiquidity of Staked Assets: Staking typically locks assets, making them illiquid. Chrysalis provides rnETH tokens, which represent the staked ETH and can be traded or used in DeFi applications, ensuring users have liquidity even while their assets are staked.
3. Complexity of Cross-Chain Staking: Cross-chain interactions can be complex and costly. Chrysalis simplifies this process, offering a user-friendly interface and automated conversions, reducing the technical barriers for users wanting to stake across different blockchains.

Chrysalis is aimed at crypto enthusiasts and investors who hold XLM or ETH and are looking for ways to maximize their returns through staking. It appeals to users who value liquidity and want to leverage their assets in DeFi while still earning staking rewards. Additionally, it targets those who appreciate the efficiency and low transaction costs of the Stellar network.

Chrysalis integrates deeply with Stellar using smart contracts on Soroban, Stellar's native smart contract platform. Here’s a detailed look at the integration and architecture:

1. Asset Conversion: Users deposit XLM into the Chrysalis platform, where a smart contract automatically converts it into ETH using a decentralized exchange (DEX) integrated within the Stellar ecosystem. This conversion process leverages Stellar's fast and cost-effective transactions.
2. Staking Mechanism: Once converted, the ETH is staked on Lido via an inter-chain bridge. The staking process is handled by another set of smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. Users receive rnETH tokens representing their staked ETH, which are issued on Stellar.
3. Liquidity and Rewards Management: rnETH tokens provide users with liquidity. These tokens can be traded on Stellar’s DEX or used in various DeFi protocols. Additionally, the staking rewards generated on Lido are periodically converted and distributed to rnETH holders through the Chrysalis platform, ensuring users benefit from their staked assets without needing to manage the complexities themselves.
4. Integration with Ecosystem Partners: Chrysalis integrates with various Stellar ecosystem partners for efficient asset conversion, secure staking, and liquidity management. Partnerships with Stellar anchors facilitate fiat on-ramps and off-ramps, enhancing the overall user experience by providing seamless entry and exit points for fiat currencies.

Chrysalis chose Stellar for several reasons:

1. Speed and Cost: Stellar’s network is known for its rapid transaction speeds and low fees, making it an ideal choice for frequent asset conversions and transfers.
2. Robust Ecosystem: Stellar’s growing ecosystem of anchors, wallets, and DEXs provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive liquid staking platform.
3. Security and Transparency: Stellar’s commitment to security and transparency aligns with Chrysalis's mission to provide a trustworthy and reliable staking service.
4. Soroban Smart Contracts: Soroban’s powerful and flexible smart contract capabilities enable the complex logic required for Chrysalis’s cross-chain staking and liquidity management, ensuring a seamless user experience.",,,https://raum.network,https://github.com/Raum-Network,,,,,,,,"Zypher Shaw, Mridul Singh, toraraum",,,https://x.com/ChrysalisFi,https://discord.gg/3TRy4pzzHn,

You can connect your native wallet, deposit native collateral, borrow bnUSD, and swap native assets cross-chain with Balanced. A portion of the ICON network's monthly ICX emissions go towards liquidity in cross-chain liquidity pools.

You can see the benefits to the user from user reviews here: https://balanced.network/reviews/, the app itself here: https://app.balanced.network/, and the on-chain statistics here: https://stats.balanced.network/. We also have an active Discord community here: https://discord.gg/ru2bJ6JRxG.

There are 4 main services in this project:
1. Balanced smart contracts - these are the DEX operations. These were written as part of our previous Activation Grant deliverables.
2. xCall smart contracts - While our focus is on Balanced and the end user, this connection also provides the infrastructure for anyone to easily make arbitrary cross-chain function calls to any of the chains ICON is connected to. The ICON blockchain serves as a router if it is not the source or destination chain of these calls. These were written as part of our previous Activation Grant deliverables.
3. Centralized relay - This relays messages between ICON and Stellar. We have implemented a variety of cross-chain protocols, ranging from trusted to trustless. Trustless bridging takes a lot more work and is a lot more expensive to verify source chain messages on the destination chain, so for the scope of this project we are focused on higher speed and lower transaction cost. There are currently two entities that operate the centralized relays, the ICON Foundation and Lydia Labs, and their on-chain messages must agree in order for a transaction to execute. This is the focus of the deliverables for this Community Award application.
4. Frontend user interface - You can see our interface at https://balanced.network/. For example, you can natively swap AVAX from Avalanche with ICX from ICON, deposit native AVAX to mint bnUSD on Avalanche, or deposit native ICX to mint bnUSD on ICON. To be able to do similarly with native XLM on Stellar are among the end results of this project.

In the previous Activation Award phase, we wrote Balanced and xCall Soroban smart contracts. In this Community Award phase, we will add Stellar to the centralized relay so that the Balanced and xCall Soroban smart contracts on Stellar can communicate with the Balanced and xCall Java smart contracts on ICON. Note that because ICON is a central hub connected to other chains, it will also be able to propagate communication to other connected chains as well, such as Avalanche.",,,https://balanced.network/,"https://github.com/icon-project/xcall-multi, https://github.com/balancednetwork, https://github.com/icon-project/centralized-relay",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE8doW77HT8,,,,,,,"arosh, cyrusvorwald ",,,https://twitter.com/BalancedDAO,https://discord.com/invite/DCa53m9wPq,

Users can overcollateralize XLM to mint stablecoins of a range of currencies through its blend pool. This blend pool allows users to deposit XLM to borrow a stablecoin of their choice, enhancing liquidity and stability across the platform. The stablecoins are added to the blend pool by the treasury contract with deposits of new stablecoins to the pool. These stablecoins can then be utilized for various financial activities such as trading and international transactions, providing flexibility and utility to cryptocurrency holders within the OrbitCDP ecosystem.

OrbitCDP mitigates cryptocurrency volatility by allowing users to collateralize their XLM and convert them into stablecoins, offering a reliable medium of exchange. This helps users avoid the need to sell their crypto assets during market downturns, thus maintaining liquidity. Additionally, OrbitCDP issued stablecoins can help facilitate fast and low-cost international transactions using Stellar's blockchain, making cross-border payments in different currencies more efficient. Furthermore, by providing stablecoins backed by XLM collateral, OrbitCDP helps users in developing countries with volatile currencies to protect their wealth and conduct transactions more reliably.",,,https://orbitcdp.finance/,https://github.com/orbit-cdp,https://youtu.be/qiFxxExaMVQ,,,,,,,"Ishan Singh, Robin Olthuis",,,,,

OTC Traders looking for a secure way to do large scale transactions without having to hold/swap on a liquidity pool. Today CEX's (as we have seen with numerous limitations) hold the market share on P2P Transactions and are not scalable in emerging and developed economies because of the various regulations and bureaucracy surrounding them. Trust still remains a major factor in P2P Payments. Counterparty risks and really slow settlement times. Stellar doesn't have a DeFi Incentivized protocol focused on stablecoins. These marketplaces are so static and rigid and are not flexible enough for under the hood automatic liquidity provision.

Our Solution:

Build: As global FX activity grows, Centralized players become increasingly fragmented. No Decentralized alternative yet. We’re bringing the full $805B FX market on-chain. Payments layer (LINK Business, DFX), FX focused liquidity layer (WAVY), Yields Layer (USDC, EURC, CADC, BRZ). WAVY is eliminating this by enabling peer-to-peer payments to be instant, secure and incentivized. P2P: OTC powered by a trustless escrow smart contract. Swap: Stablecoin swaps powered by WAVY'S P2P Marketplace, Soroswap etc. Spend: Stablecoin digital debit card. Bridge: Stablecoin transfer across blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Stellar, Avalanche). Top Up & withdraw: Compliant local on & off ramps (For Consumer: SEP6/24, Bank Transfer, MoneyGram, VISA, Interac, Google Pay) (For Businesses: LINK Business).

By leveraging partnerships with stablecoin anchors to enable said on & off-ramps. This also in turn boosts the respective anchors activity on Stellar. Permissionless on and off ramps leveraging anchor partnerships on the network (on the roadmap as well would be to build sort of a bridge on soroban smart contract that would allow cross chain). FOCUS IS BUILDING the Largest Stablecoin P2P Marketplace where users get to buy/sell stablecoins with other stablecoins at their own terms, in this case we are building our own asset trustless set of escrow contracts on Soroban that would hold the both stables that lets the both users sign through their wallets with/without the other counterparty.

Think of it as a decentralized Binance P2P Place but for stablecoins where users can buy a stablecoin of their choice (from the Vendor or Ad) and off-ramp that to a local payment method using the inbuilt ramp feature unique to the anchors. Or use the bridge feature powered by the soroban smart contract to send it across different chains.

Even with the new policies Argentina has been implementing which kept the ARS at USD 1:ARS 1000 for nearly four months, recently the ARS has again devalued from USD 1:1000 to USD 1:1300 (30% depreciation) almost overnight. See: https://cuex.com/en/usd-ars_pa At SGF (SGF Solutions SRL), we have 12 years of providing financial solutions to Argentinians, and through our well-established network of retail and corporate clients, we are able to provide double the liquidity in ARS and USD than the other two providers combined, monthly; our relevant monthly volumes are ~ARS 600M (7.2bn/yr) in bank transfers (payouts) which are exchanged from ~USD 500,000/month (6M/yr) and smaller volumes of crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT) totalling ~USD 100,000. Our operating fees, while dynamic, are generally between 0% and 1%. We believe this is a good fit for the Stellar network, which prides itself on providing low fees for financial transactions. While not relevant to this application, we also provide remittances from Argentina to Spain, which has seen a significant uptake in the last few years as the emigration rates increased due to Argentina’s poor economic conditions. It’s important to clarify that we are not looking to issue our own ARS asset, but rather to improve the interoperability of the Stellar blockchain by accepting Stellar’s USDC and off-ramping ARS directly to bank accounts and digital wallets (CBU’s and CVU’s such as MercadoPago, see https://www.bcra.gob.ar/MediosPago/Politica_Pagos-i.asp). SGF proposes building an application that leverages the Stellar Anchor Platform and SEP-24 to accept USDC and offramp ARS. This is supported in SEP-24 as per this pull request https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1064, and we quote: “This protocol was originally designed to provide conversions between off-chain and on-chain equivalent assets – for instance BRL <> BRLT, USD <> USDC, NGN <> NGNT, etc. – but it has been updated to make exchanges between off-chain and on-chain non-equivalent assets like BRL <> USDC.“ Our use case is USDC <> ARS (one-way, to begin with).

Problem

According to a Bloomberg report, the audio-visual industry in Africa faces significant challenges due to the high cost and limited accessibility of gear and studio spaces for creators to execute audio-visual projects. It's estimated that the audio-visual industry loses approximately USD 1.2 billion yearly due to these barriers. Additionally, the lack of professional workshops, audio-visual production courses, and training hampers the productivity and profitability of African creators.

Solution

Gearup solves this problem through a peer-2-peer marketplace application that lets creators across Africa have seamless access to quality gear, studio spaces, and professional courses they need to bring their vision to life without the burden of high purchasing costs. We do this by leveraging blockchain technology to track and trace gear, courses, and studio trades and reward good actions in the trading process to ensure security, speed, and transparency.

Additional Information

Gearup offers a decentralized investment opportunity for both creators and non-creators to invest in high-demand gear and list them on the marketplace to generate passive income from rentals. In addition, our comprehensive insurance coverage helps to protect gear owners from all forms of eventualities. This innovative model allows anyone to invest and participate in the creative economy.

The Opportunity

Building Gearup on the Stellar network offers unparalleled opportunities for marketplace applications due to Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions and robust security features. Stellar Network will enhance Gearup's efficiency in handling micro-transactions and on-chain tracking of gear movement from person to person. In addition, Stellar's infrastructure ensures transparency, reduces operational costs, and enables seamless integration with financial institutions built on Stellar. In return, Stellar Network will benefit from Gearup through automatic onboarding of Gearup users into the Stellar Network, increased transaction volume and network activity which can enhance liquidity and network robustness.

GiveCredit's pilot initiative is offsetting the total carbon dioxide emissions from the Stellar blockchain ecosystem, partnering with SCF grantees StellarCarbon (who are providing carbon credits sourced from Verra, a leading carbon credit provider) and PublicNode (a 501(c)3 nonprofit providing blockchain infrastructure accepting donations to make Stellar fully carbon neutral).

GiveCredit solves different problems for different customer demographics. For donors: It allows them to reduce crypto-related tax fees such as capital gains by making tax-deductible donations for negligible fees, while also making a verifiable positive impact on the environment. For nonprofits: It opens a new source of funding, as well as enabling them to a positive impact on the environment (such as offsetting the emissions from their work). For blockchain carbon projects: it provides a stream of revenue- people to buy the tokenized credits they are offering! For interested third parties such as governments, corporations and foundations- it provides a way to crowdfund carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and other emissions offset initiatives, as well as a source of data about positive environmental impact being made by citizens and nonprofits. For the planet and humanity: Donations through GiveCredit help fund ecosystem preservation and other forms of positive environmental impact.

How GiveCredit Works: First, the user chooses a project in the GiveCredit app, and goes through the payment flow to send a cryptocurrency donation for the desired amount. At this point, the user can elect to mint an NFT containing the donation details in the metadata as well as to receive a receipt email for tax purposes. The NFT is minted on Soroban using a modified ERC-721 contract.

Second, the donation flows to the nonprofit, where it is then divided by Soroban smart contract. A portion, typically 10%, is retained by the nonprofit to cover administrative fees and overhead, and the remainder used to retire carbon credits. The remaining funds are sorted by Soroban smart contract into “buckets” corresponding to the price of one carbon credit, after which they are transmitted to the carbon credit provider (in this case, StellarCarbon).

Third, when funds are received by StellarCarbon, they retire carbon credits for the given amount and expose the retirement data in their API, to be accessed by GiveCredit. Finally, GiveCredit’s hook system retrieves retirement information and mints it automatically by Soroban smart contract as an NFT under the appropriate initiative, forming a verifiable connection between the donation and the emissions offset.

Donation, donor identity, NFT, and carbon credit data are stored in GiveCredit's registry database to create a full record of all behavior, display up-to-date data (e.g. carbon credit price, initiative progress) and ensure reliable and efficient performance within the GiveCredit app.",,,https://givecredits.cfce.io/,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqSn07fPMqDtFnh6Bc6MUcH3yTHL2UIe/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,Evan Cooper Hudson,,,https://x.com/c4collabecon,,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Rs3PAyj7fjI-Q6fCk5jVdqLukWxrCcy9ZORQrkQI18/edit?usp=sharing

Our pursuit of this idea stemmed from personal experiences seeking ways to safeguard and grow wealth amidst economic volatility. Traditional financial solutions like mobile money and banks proved inadequate, leading us to explore alternatives.

Cryptocurrencies emerged as a potential remedy, but their complexity and the focus of platforms like Coinbase and MetaMask on card users excluded many. Despite digital transaction growth during the pandemic, challenges like high fees and fragmented infrastructure remained, making cross-border payments difficult—an issue still experienced by Richard and me, along with millions of African workers.

The pandemic underscored the limitations of mobile money, as services like Spotify and Netflix required cards, excluding many youth. A survey of 350 people showed high demand for these services among underserved youth. Observing these gaps, we leveraged our expertise in mobile payments and blockchain, and my cofounder's legal background, to create a solution. We identified blockchain, stablecoins, and innovative card distribution as key to addressing Africa's financial issues.

We assembled a team to tackle technical and regulatory challenges, aiming to empower millions of underserved African youth with access to financial services, wealth preservation, and global economic participation. Our solution is a stablecoin app that lets users open dollar accounts on their smartphones, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. Users get virtual and physical debit cards linked to their balance, enabling online and offline transactions. The app allows free, instant P2P transfers and offers savings, yield earning, and borrowing against savings, helping users preserve wealth amidst economic volatility.

The app also introduces users to cryptocurrency investment, simplifying the process while maintaining blockchain benefits. Our strategy focuses on Africa due to its unique financial landscape and the potential for transformative change through blockchain and stablecoin adoption. Africa's high internet and smartphone penetration support this integration, mirroring successes seen in regions like Latin America. Our goal is to foster financial inclusion and empowerment for Africa's youth, driving socio-economic transformation across the continent.

How we use Soroban:
- Connect to Blend Liquidity protocol to allow users to earn yield on their USDC
- Plan to create our own liquidity pool through Blend

Go To Market:
- Start with Kenya, leveraging high interest in Bitcoin as an investment, then funnel users to save and earn yield.
- Provide users with cards for payments.

OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,SCF #28,OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec59dhu7lEcLfHwR,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$40500.00,$40500.00,463774.09,7/10/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,OCTO is a super dApp that revolves around NFT and digital assets with a strong emphasis on creators and their communities.,"Our project, OCTO, named after the octopus, reflects our vision and platform functionality. OCTO aims to be the ultimate NFT hub focusing on creators' content and their communities. Despite differing opinions on NFTs as digital assets, their permanence and evolving use cases are undeniable. Here are some key foundations of OCTO:

Limited and/or Fractioned Functionality: Popular blockchains like Ethereum or Solana offer a variety of NFT-related services, but even these require multiple platforms for basic actions. Other blockchains, including Stellar, lack a convenient all-in-one platform, causing wasted time/money, unnecessary friction, and potential for fraud.

Lack of Engagement / Crypto Tribalism: Successful NFT projects need to outreach, engage, and onboard users. However, different standards and blockchain interoperability issues force NFT creators to choose between their favorite blockchain or a more NFT-centric one for a larger audience. This crypto tribalism draws quality projects from blockchains like Stellar to Ethereum or Solana.

Content Creator Economy: As the 'flipper economy' declines, NFT collectors seek projects with immediate and long-term benefits. Entertainment and content take center stage, yet there is typically no method to share content with the project's community safely, timely, and conveniently. Creators often resort to custom-built websites or multiple platforms to achieve basic results. The content creator economy of NFT projects should be rewarded to incentivize quality projects.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: The often-overused concepts of Maslow's pyramid of hierarchy are representative of NFT communities, particularly the 'Love and Belongingness' and 'Self-actualization' layers. These explain one's aspiration to be part of exclusive communities and engage with peers.

Problem & Areas of Improvement

Research on Stellar NFTs revealed several improvement areas we aim to address:

1. Lack of Latest NFT ERC-Compliant Standards on Soroban: This issue causes unnecessary friction for users.
2. Insufficient Functionality of Other NFT Marketplaces: Existing marketplaces offer limited functionality compared to OCTO and often operate as custodial services, limiting true asset control.
3. Lack of Community Building and Engagement: Current Stellar-oriented marketplaces do not focus on community building, engagement, or other aspects of Gamification and SocioFi of the NFT experience.

OCTO's Solutions & Benefits

We aim to provide the most comprehensive NFT toolbox for the Stellar community with features like a no-code Launchpad, Stellar-based on-chain discussion boards, and auctions. Key USPs include:

- Stellar-based Launchpad: Enables easy NFT collection kickstarts with no-code, lazy minting upon user interaction, and supports advanced standards like ERC-1155 or ERC-404 for complex projects.

- Intends to approve token permissions to an untrustworthy address.
- Engages with an address previously linked to suspicious activities.

How it Works:
Upon initiating a transaction, W3A intercepts the call to Metamask, pauses it momentarily to analyze the codebase for potential red flags such as suspicious logic, dangerous functions, or risky access permissions. The tool also simulates the transaction on a dedicated testnet to check what will enter and leave a user’s wallet. Within seconds, W3A provides a comprehensive report detailing the transaction's potential threats and outcomes, empowering users to make informed decisions about proceeding. All transaction data, detected threats, and approved accesses are conveniently displayed on the W3A Dashboard.

Currently, W3A supports Ethereum. We aim to add support for Stellar and enable Stellar users to proactively protect their assets and steer clear of scams and fraud.",,, https://web3antivirus.io/   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web3-antivirus/inejiiekmjkmphgjjehhcmkpjncboodn   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web3-antivirus/   https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/web3-antivirus/nggcakhlblakghejdigkaekbhicfkckn ,https://github.com/web3-antivirus/chrome-extension,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qSXp6_IHCI ,,,,,,,Ksenia Ksenia,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3-antivirus/,https://twitter.com/web3_antivirus/,https://discord.com/invite/4hJAJUQCR2,

The product is property-testing based formal verification for Soroban smart contracts. This enables developers to write Rust property tests and not just fuzz over them, but formally verify them, to achieve the highest level of assurance for their codebase.

The problem being solved is that formal verification is difficult for many engineers to get started with, but by taking a property-testing approach, Runtime Verification is lowering the barrier to entry. This allows developers to include formal verification in their normal quality assurance processes, even enabling it on CI, using our open source tooling. One example of the success of this is when Amazon enabled formal verification of C code using C property tests (and CBMC for model checking). They had great success getting normal C developers to do formal verification at a much larger scale than previously by using the property-testing based approach.

Our tool uses KWasm to do symbolic execution of compiled Soroban smart contracts. There is tooling for turning Rust-level property tests into WebAssembly code (via the compiler), and then into KWasm based verification challenges. Once the verification is complete (passed, failed, or unsure), the result is translated back to the Rust level for developers to understand the next step. This keeps developers in their own workflow, rather than asking them to step outside of it. This first activation award is focused on specializing KWasm to Soroban by implementing the Soroban host functions.",,,https://kasmer.runtimeverification.com,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0f3N39DGMw,,,,,,,Paul Len,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3142238/,https://twitter.com/rv_inc,https://discord.gg/CurfmXNtbN,
Merkle Tree Airdrop Tooling,SCF #28,Merkle Tree Airdrop Tooling,Merkle Tree Airdrop Tooling,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recf8bn219NPAb7rX,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$48000.00,$48000.00,526239.05,6/26/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Open-source tool for efficient Stellar airdrops enabling scalable and cost-effective token &amp; NFT distribution via smart contracts,"Sorodrop addresses a significant gap in the Stellar ecosystem: the lack of an efficient, scalable, and low-cost solution for conducting large-scale airdrops of tokens and NFTs. Currently, projects wanting to distribute tokens or NFTs to a large audience face technical challenges, high gas fees, and inefficient distribution mechanisms, which hinders their ability to reach wider audiences effectively.

Wasted effort: Teams currently develop their own airdrop solutions from scratch, wasting valuable developer time and SCF funds. Sorodrop eliminates this inefficiency by providing ready-made airdrop functionality, ensuring no team has to start from scratch again. Inefficient Distribution: Existing methods are slow and can't handle large recipient numbers effectively. High Costs: High gas fees make large-scale token and NFT distribution expensive. Lack of Automation: Manual interventions increase errors and reduce efficiency. Resource Wastage: Unclaimed tokens or NFTs often go to waste without a clawback mechanism. Rigidity in Distribution: Current solutions lack flexibility to pause, resume, or stage airdrops as needed.

Sorodrop caters to various groups within the Stellar ecosystem: Project Owners: Launching new tokens or NFTs and needing a cost-effective way to distribute them widely. Developers: Seeking robust tools for efficient token and NFT distribution without high costs. Community Managers: Rewarding community members efficiently and transparently. Marketers: Conducting promotional campaigns to attract or retain users through airdrops. Fundraisers: Using airdrops to support fundraising events and achieve milestones.

As an example, we recently had an exploratory conversation with the growing Token Tails community. They need to airdrop their tokens and NFTs to over a thousand addresses. Currently, this isn’t possible on Stellar without manual effort or writing a custom contract. This need is already evident in the ecosystem, and it will become more apparent as more projects and communities grow on Stellar. SoroDrop will save teams and SCF thousands of dollars and hours of work.

Solving this problem will positively impact the Stellar ecosystem: Increased Adoption: Easier, cost-effective distribution attracts more projects to the Stellar network. Enhanced Engagement: Efficient airdrops foster higher community engagement and participation. Innovation Encouragement: Reliable distribution tools encourage developers to innovate on Stellar. Resource Optimization: Clawback functionality prevents resource wastage, boosting ecosystem efficiency. Market Expansion: Projects reach larger audiences without technical and financial constraints, growing the user base and market penetration for Stellar-based assets.

Sorodrop streamlines the creation and distribution of tokens and NFTs on the Stellar network using the Soroban framework. Sorodrop addresses the aforementioned issues in several ways: Efficient Distribution through Merkle Trees: Sorodrop uses Merkle tree structures to handle large-scale airdrops efficiently, reducing computational load and ensuring quick, accurate distribution. Cost Reduction: The platform minimizes gas fees, making token and NFT claims more affordable. Automation and User-Friendly Interfaces: Sorodrop automates airdrop execution by allowing CSV uploads of recipient addresses, reducing errors and enhancing efficiency. Resource Optimization through Clawback Functionality: Unclaimed tokens or NFTs can be reclaimed by the project owner, preventing resource wastage. Distribution Flexibility: Project owners can pause and resume airdrops, offering greater control over the distribution process. Multi-Stage Airdrops: Supports staggered distributions, beneficial for complex tokenomics or tiered reward systems. All of Sorodrop’s software components will be open sourced and this will allow users to tailor their airdrop however they want. Application specific airdrops can be made possible with custom development on top of Sorodrop’s smart contracts.

There have been several attempts at airdrop tools on Stellar, but none have gained traction or are widely considered by projects in the Stellar ecosystem. Our airdrop project on Stellar stands out with several key features that will change this: We support airdrops with over a thousand recipients by implementing merkle calculation for greater gas efficiency. Project owners can customize airdrop terms, including start time, expiration time, name, and logo. Our platform allows multi-stage airdrops, enabling tiered structures within a single contract. Owners can pause and resume airdrops for enhanced security. We are open-source, providing users and project owners access to our tools and contracts for secure use. We also offer the capability to airdrop NFTs to large audiences.",,,N/A,,https://www.loom.com/share/dd8fa363e8084969b217f2b7151b1f60?sid=bde11a68-a997-45f6-9e7c-1bd5a9d095fd,,,,,,,"Arda Nakisci, Hasan İrice",,,,,

Git is one of the most widely used VCS and while being by design decentralized, developers rely on very centralized synchronization systems such as GitHub.

This centralization raises serious concerns as any actor gaining access to these repositories can: change the history, update code, make releases, and even delete files. All while being hardly noticeable. As open source software is relied upon by all industries, it poses a real threat in terms of software supply chain security.

The core idea of this proposal is to bring Git hashes onto Stellar's blockchain to benefit from the traceability and accountability blockchain technology guarantees. The code itself is still versioned using Git and it is still hosted on the synchronization platform of choice, which does not interfere with maintainers' traditional workflows. This gives maintainers access to new ways of managing their project on-chain and at its core it provides a distributed way to prove the integrity of their project.

Our project will greatly benefit Stellar's ecosystem as open-source maintainers using our system will get to use Stellar and Soroban. This will in turn bring some of these maintainers to the Stellar ecosystem.

Version Control System (VCS), specifically using Git, is ubiquitous among software engineers. Git is by design decentralized, more so, the code history makes use of a Merkle tree: a given version, referred to as a commit, is given a hash and hashes are linked together to provide a history. Git is in essence a blockchain.

When working on a project using Git, everyone gets the complete history and people can push and pull code from one person to another. The resolution of differences between one's code to another can be challenging if many people work on the same code area.

In practice, a team of developers-maintainers need a more convenient way to synchronize their work. To address this problem, maintainers can use a central platform where they can synchronize their work. GitHub is the most used platform to share and collaborate on open-source projects. For many teams, the whole software development lifecycle happens there, from the inception of ideas to making a release of a new version.

This centralization brings a lot of challenges when it comes to securing the software supply chain. In past years, we have seen attacks on almost every, if not all, parts of this centralized structure. Maintainers are being compromised, they become rogue, through exploits on GitHub or in the continuous integration system the code is compromised, there are occurrences of release artifacts being compromised and GitHub is also deleting projects which they deemed (albeit enforced by local regulations) not suitable for their platforms.

To answer these concerns around software supply chain security, we propose to leverage the Stellar blockchain to store Git hashes. The following components are proposed: (i) a Soroban smart contract to register Git hashes on-chain; (ii) a dApp for maintainers to manage their projects and users to participate and monitor their dependencies; and (iii) tools to help maintainers deploy and use this system transparently.

The core of the proposal is a Soroban Smart Contract called: Soroban Versioning contract. This contract will set the foundation of what will be built to support maintainers with their projects.

The contract will hold project-specific metadata and a key pointing to the last code change hash. Updating the hash leaves a permanent record on-chain. These update events can be monitored to build an off-chain history and be further compared to the state on other platforms such as GitHub. We will build the necessary services to ingest these events. These services will play a pivotal role as sitting in between Soroban and our proposed dApp.

Strict access control is key to guarantee that only maintainers can update on-chain data. Soroban provides an elegant and robust solution with address signing. By storing a list of authorized maintainers on-chain, we are enabling projects to be more transparent as to who has specific rights.

As we have seen in past similar projects, the developer experience is paramount to get any traction and adoption. To that end, we will provide various pre-commit hooks to seamlessly fit most maintainers' workflow.

Last but not least, our codebase will not only be open-sourced, our development will also be open. We will ensure that we provide comprehensive documentation and that the code can be easily understood and audited. Maintainers will need guarantees that we are only doing what they explicitly want us to do with their credentials.",,,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,,,,,,,Tupui,logomark_black.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1758463200000/w4iLmh7jjNTJsD1aRmYD2w/VgoOPZzVtIhuArCvnWi4y4HXYkoXi_VEX7-_BQkjmN4bEsnDfiDmLNW6E5Prmpi-4P2OgGlQJ2dpWNMMxi-3wLbkorYHiQIsDvcY2GgfwsVIKhdMP_ko7iaaMmNBCVCt19cuHglU52m7UzlTk-ZQKRCNBRv2vTuRPQcCRuIy3bw/1_V5VxWb5eA3kQpu1pcT3ojWQ74UyKmvWHWpJiFRlmc),,,,

The Stellar Startup Camp is a program that provides the guidance and building blocks needed for startups looking to launch their projects on Stellar. Bigger ran the first Startup camp with 34 companies. For the first iteration of the Stellar Startup Camp, we developed the Startup Camp Gitbook and the Figma file, which is what founders use to turn their vision into a well-crafted application. The Figma file containing the design sprint has been thoroughly tested in beta with a select number of founders (previous to the Startup Camp), and we will continue to tailor it with each iteration. Important: The Stellar Development Foundation can use the resulting startup camp materials and knowledge independently of Bigger, meaning the SDF is not vendor-locked. Besides the direct value we bring to the community in the form of new projects and helping reviews be of higher quality, we are also able to provide value by gathering insights from seeing the entire funnel, from companies hearing about the Stellar funding opportunities (with little to no prior Stellar knowledge) until they apply to the SCF and how they receive and act on the feedback given by reviewers.

Key learnings:
The technical aspect of Stellar remains a challenge for newcomers. Here is where a dedicated team of mentors makes a difference. By clarifying concepts and ensuring the technical solutions make sense, companies gain clarity on leveraging the Stellar network and give reviewers confidence that the team knows what they are doing and is ready to build. Go-to-market strategy needs to be more prominent. There is a notorious shift in the reviewer’s preference for projects that bring (existing) users to the community. Some “unwritten” rules for projects need to be included in the SCF handbook and cascaded to the Startup Camp. For example, Anchors will not be funded without an existing attestation of reserves and active userbase. The Startup Camp was more intensive than anticipated. We should start earlier by giving people access to the basic Stellar resources and setting some expectations around what they should acquaint themselves with before starting. It needs to extend beyond the deadline to support people with resubmissions, where eligible.

Key metrics:
122 companies pre-registered. 34 companies selected. 29 companies finished the Startup Camp (~85% of participants). 26 companies submitted (~90% of those who finished). 7 companies funded (~27% of submitted). 10 participants gave us feedback (~30%); the average score was 4.9 out of 5.

What was our initial objective and how did we do? The objectives of our initial application were to turn the Startup camp process into a self-serve process that attracts fresh talent from diverse demographics more frequently and sets them up for success. Self-serve process: The first iteration of Startup Camp 2.0 set the baseline for where we stand today. The two most highlighted aspects of the Startup Camp were the clarity we brought participants on how to submit a project to the Stellar Community Fund (self-serve) and the technical support we offered throughout the process (still manual). Fresh talent: 122 participants. Diverse demographics: We selected teams from South and North America, Africa, Europe, Oceania (AU & NZ) and Asia. More frequently: This startup camp will run in July (the last one was in April), which is already 1 month sooner than the previous version. We aim to keep streamlining this process so it can run every month. That sets participants up for success: 90% of participants presented their project to the SCF, 73% asked to resubmit, and 27% funded projects. The biggest challenge was that people weren’t sure who would build the solution.

To wrap up, some unfiltered feedback:
""I am surprised by the careful thought you guys have been giving during this entire time. We can see that every step was considered and we are doing our best to learn the tools, through the daily meetings and mentors. I will overshare a little here: I was recently fired from a company that was very hard to work with, had many many problems and I felt just a number there. And I fall here, in the SCF Camp with all this love, respect, and kindness to each other. Just makes me try even harder because that is the life I want. Those are the people I want to be next to. Thank you guys!"" ""Invaluable feedback and insights from every team member!"" ""Figma file could have been more defined and ready to be used as a first time user.

ClickPesa Debt Fund,SCF #28,Making DeFi Finance work #2,ClickPesa Debt Fund,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recEgzZZ8W6tacMCS,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$95000.00,$95000.00,1042560.62,7/11/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,We provide Web3 End-to-End transparency and accountability promoting access to funding for financial institutions.,"The primary challenge addressed by the ClickPesa Debt Fund is the lack of transparency that often characterizes traditional DeFi lending systems. Typically, once funds are raised, they transition off-chain, leading to a subsequent lack of transparency. This opacity can shy away investors, limit access to capital and availability of capital.

Our project, the ClickPesa Debt Fund, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) debt fund that leverages the Stellar Network and Soroban smart contracts to provide end-to-end traceability in the lending process. The intentions are to bring enhanced transparency to DeFi lending, making each step in the lending chain—from disbursement to repayment—fully verifiable and transparent. The ClickPesa Debt Fund introduces a solution that maintains traceability entirely on-chain, ensuring that every transaction is recorded and accessible, by leveraging our licensed payment gateway ClickPesa, which is already integrated with Stellar and providing a wallet to each MFI. This approach not only increases confidence among investors by providing clear visibility into the flow of funds but also enhances the ability of MFIs and SMEs to secure necessary financing under fair conditions.

Target Audience and Their Benefits:

Lenders benefit from increased transparency, which reduces risk and provides clearer insight into how their funds are being utilized.

MFIs gain better access to funds through a transparent platform, enabling them to expand their operations and support more SMEs efficiently.

SMEs benefit from more readily available funding opportunities, facilitating growth and operational stability.

How does it work and how does it use Stellar and Soroban:

ClickPesa utilizes the Stellar Network for its robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure, which is ideal for handling cost-efficient and reliable transactions. On top of this, we employ Soroban smart contracts with the ClickPesa Debt Fund to automate and secure the lending process:

Disbursement and Collection Visibility: Smart contracts track and verify the actual flow of funds to and from MFIs, ensuring all parties adhere to agreed terms.

Fee Transparency: All fees charged during the lending process are recorded and made visible through the blockchain, preventing hidden charges and fostering trust.

Automated Execution: Our platform automates transactions such as fund disbursements and repayments based on predefined criteria or milestones. For example, when a payment is made, the smart contract automatically executes the necessary actions, such as refunding money back to the appropriate entity.",,,https://clickpesadebtfund.com,,https://youtu.be/pMa1aHESACQ,,,,,,,"Rick Groothuizen, rlematz ",,,,,

It is powered by a PoS blockchain infrastructure. The product includes the development of a secure and cost-effective EVM-Soroban stablecoin bridge with low latency.

Interoperability has long been a challenge addressed by blockchain developers. Many interoperability technologies focus on moving assets between siloed chains, but this raises concerns about a single point of failure. To address this issue, oracle protocols like Chainlink have developed inter-chain messaging protocols that relay data between siloed chains. However, most of these oracles, like Chainlink, do not support non-EVM blockchains.

ZKLiquid proposes an EVM-Soroban bridge for stablecoins. This solution relies on ZKLiquid's interoperability messaging protocol, a decentralized network that uses a PoS consensus mechanism to validate and synchronize data between EVM chains and Soroban.

Bridging liquidity between EVM chains and Soroban in a secure and efficient manner is crucial. This capability will enable users to freely transfer assets back and forth. Consequently, many crypto enthusiasts who have long relied on EVM chains for interoperability will now have the opportunity to utilize dApps and hold assets on the Soroban blockchain. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in the number of users and the on-chain TVL of Soroban.",,,https://app.zkliquid.io,https://app.zkliquid.io/swap,https://app.zkliquid.io/swap,,,,,,,Adedotun Akintayo,,,https://x.com/LiquidsFi,,

As a result, the merchant receives instant access to revenue and simplified accounting, as these funds are put straight into their bank account.

SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) Integration (for European Merchants): PlutoPe leverages SEP-6, a standardized protocol within the Stellar ecosystem for European merchants. This enables smooth deposits and withdrawals between the merchant's PlutoPe account and their external bank accounts, streamlining financial operations.

User-Friendly Interface: PlutoPe prioritizes simplicity of use. A user-friendly interface allows merchants to manage their cryptocurrency wallet balances in many currencies. They can also check the complete transaction history for record-keeping and access current conversion rates to make informed choices.

Dapp (Decentralized Application) Integration: PlutoPe plans to include a Dapp (decentralized application) within its merchant app. Further features offered by this Dapp might include advanced analytics for a more in-depth understanding of consumer behavior and spending trends, and combining rewards programs with cryptocurrency to encourage usage.

Problem Solving: Explain the problems your product addresses, how it resolves them, and the benefits for your target audience, including personas. The traditional payment landscape presents several challenges for merchants:

Traditional payment systems are costly as they require payment infrastructure, such as POS machines and payment gateways, which all come at a charge or monthly fee that not everyone can afford.

Merchants lose over 3-5% of revenue during the settlement of funds.

The setup of traditional payments is time-consuming and requires documentation and paperwork from banks.

Merchants in traditional payment systems face many limitations. They cannot accept international payments, limiting them to a domestic customer base.

Merging traditional payment gateways into crypto is challenging; hence, a new solution is required.

To accept international payments, merchants need to pay settlement fees.

PlutoPe addresses these challenges by offering:

Reduced Operational Costs: Removing specialized crypto infrastructure requirements saves businesses time and money.

Merchants save over 3-5% of the settlement fee banks charge.

Setting up a crypto payments gateway with PlutoPe is neither time-consuming nor expensive. Merchants can accept a variety of cryptocurrencies through our user-friendly multi-chain wallet, eliminating the need for separate integrations for each blockchain.

With PlutoPe, there isn't any limitation in accepting international payments. Since cryptocurrencies are global, a user can pay in the crypto of their choice, and the merchant can settle that amount instantly in their preferred fiat currency. The amount will be deposited directly into their bank account. This eliminates the risk associated with crypto price fluctuations and simplifies accounting processes.

PlutoPe Merchant app is the ground-breaking solution that will provide a gateway to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance.

With the PlutoPe merchant app, the merchant does not need to pay any settlement fees on international payment settlements.

Operational Mechanism: PlutoPe makes use of Stellar blockchain technology's innovative functions:

Fast and Scalable Transactions: Stellar's distributed ledger facilitates rapid and efficient processing of crypto payments, even during high transaction volumes.

Low Transaction Fees: Stellar's network architecture enables minimal fees compared to traditional payment methods, benefiting merchants and customers.

Enhanced Security: Stellar's robust security protocols ensure the safe and transparent transfer of crypto funds.

Integration with Anchor Protocol: Integrating PlutoPe with the Anchor protocol is essential to its operation. Anchor, which serves as a bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat money, makes the fiat settlements fast, a fundamental component of PlutoPe's product.

Seamless User Experience: PlutoPe provides merchants with a user-friendly interface for managing their crypto wallets, tracking transaction history, and accessing real-time conversion rates.",,,https://www.plutope.io/,,https://www.loom.com/share/9697106ae34a45538435b2501ae5ce14?sid=c6906dcd-808b-4952-999b-3d475ff34075,,,,,,,"Kumar Chetan Tyagi, kchetantyagi",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/plutope/,https://x.com/Plutopeio,,

We build tools that enable anyone to fund anything and track impact across different blockchains. Our build on Stellar is GrantPicks, a mobile responsive application that uses pairwise voting to reduce the cognitive overload of allocating funding to projects. This enables grantmakers to allocate funding distributed across projects and community members to vote, allowing for a more decentralized funding program. We will integrate an on-chain project directory, and round factory contract to allow anyone to run their own permissionless budget boxing application.

Problem: Growing an ecosystem is hard. Allocating capital and keeping track of project image is hard. There is no way to support projects on Stellar directly.

Our goals: Bring more transparency and streamline project tracking on chain. Bring external capital into the Stellar ecosystem. Supplement community fund delegation. Reduce cognitive overload for grant and community members. Continue to build out new funding mechanisms on top of Sorbon.

Currently, there is no on-chain application for communities to support public goods on Stellar built on Soroban directly. We will change this with our vaulting mechanisms, which delegate funds via Pairwise + Budget Boxing algorithms. This enables anyone to create their own funding round. Projects to enlist in an on-chain project registry and apply to rounds. Anyone to fund ongoing rounds. Quick voting rounds to delegate and allocate funding.

As part of this ask: $50,000 for development. Cover audit costs for vaults (audit bank). $150,000 USD worth of XLM to put in vaults to run a series of 3 $50,000 rounds after the next SCF round. Marketing & onboarding of Stellar ecosystem onto GrantPicks (verified community voters and projects).

Rehoboth Finance,SCF #27,Rehoboth Finance,Rehoboth Finance,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recHJGfP4QX8paLWp,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$23300.00,$23300.00,212343.64,5/24/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Crypto savings wallet for Africans,"Rehoboth is a crypto wallet that gives users the ability to earn yield in a secure, safe, and transparent manner. One of the biggest problems facing some African currency devaluation due to economic factors and crypto is one of the leading ways for people to hedge against the high rate of inflation. This is why Rehoboth is on a mission to curb economic waste and shield users against high inflation rates.

Our shared goal with SDF is to provide people with equitable access to the global financial system through savings products that help them generate yield while they go about their daily business. Are we the only ones doing this? Of course not. That is why we believe we will be such a phenomenal success as others who have walked this path have. We have a very good founder-market fit and will prove that as we go in this application to show we have the data and skill set to solve this problem. Another major thing we have looked at is that people who hold crypto don’t actually like to spend it. Data has shown and proven that we are in fact in the heart of the biggest crypto mine in the world, Nigeria. Nigeria has beaten every country in high volumes of crypto trades and you can easily tell why. Everyone wants to invest. Most people really don’t care about buying stuff for clout right now as they can sense the urgent need to save. Finally, a major constraint comes around being able to use a crypto wallet seed phrase and not lose your money. There is an issue with writing down your private key and being able to operate a non-custodial wallet. This is why we’re opting for a 3-key Multi-sig wallet where users have their funds but we can help them sign transactions and in the case of losing their keys, we can recover their funds and move them to a new account.

Problems Rehoboth Solves

1. High Inflation and Economic Uncertainty: Problem: African currencies are prone to devaluation due to economic factors, leading to high inflation rates. This poses a significant challenge for individuals seeking financial stability. Solution: Rehoboth provides a crypto wallet that allows users to earn yield in a secure, safe, and transparent manner. By leveraging crypto assets, users can hedge against currency devaluation and inflation, thus safeguarding their wealth.

2. Limited Access to Financial Services: Problem: Many people in Africa lack access to traditional financial services, limiting their ability to save and invest effectively. Solution: Rehoboth aims to provide equitable access to the global financial system through savings products that help users generate yield. By offering these services, Rehoboth empowers individuals to build wealth and achieve financial security.

3. Hesitancy to Spend Crypto: Problem: Despite the growing popularity of crypto in Africa, many people are reluctant to spend it, preferring to hold onto their assets for investment purposes. Solution: Rehoboth addresses this issue by offering a platform that combines both payment and investment functionalities. By providing opportunities to earn yield on crypto holdings, Rehoboth incentivizes users to save and invest while still offering the ability to make payments when needed.

4. Security Concerns with Non-Custodial Wallets: Problem: Users often face challenges in securely managing their crypto assets, particularly when it comes to safeguarding private keys and seed phrases. Solution: Rehoboth implements a three-key multi-signature wallet system, providing users with enhanced security and peace of mind. In the event of lost keys, Rehoboth can assist in recovering funds and ensuring uninterrupted access to assets. By addressing these problems, Rehoboth aims to provide a comprehensive solution that promotes financial inclusion, stability, and security for users in Africa and beyond.

How are users getting access to Forex?

Stablecoins as Forex: Reasons and Benefits

Stablecoins are gaining traction as an alternative to traditional methods for forex transactions, offering several advantages: Reasons for using stablecoins in forex:

Unlike traditional currencies, stablecoins are pegged to assets like fiat currencies or baskets of other currencies. This significantly reduces their price fluctuations, making them more predictable and less risky for forex transactions.

Stablecoins leverage blockchain technology, enabling faster and often cheaper cross-border transactions compared to traditional systems. This is due to the elimination of intermediaries and faster settlement times.

Unlike traditional forex markets, stablecoin markets operate 24/7, allowing for greater flexibility and convenience for users.

Blockchain technology provides transparent and secure transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.

Stablecoins offer the potential for financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for individuals without traditional bank accounts.

Steps involved in accessing stablecoins on Rehoboth:

The user creates an account and moves to verify their identity (KYC/AML) by making their first deposit.

The user chooses the desired “stablecoins” to purchase within the Rehoboth platform.

Rehoboth allows users to select their preferred payment method (e.g., bank transfer, mobile money).

The user initiates the purchase with the chosen payment method and the transaction is processed.

Rehoboth users can also convert deposited fiat currency to the selected stablecoin at competitive rates.

Purchased “stablecoins” are credited to the user's Rehoboth account, ready for business transactions.

What tokens do we support?

USDC XLM BTC ETH

How will the savings feature work?

1. User Enrollment: Users opt-in to the savings feature within the Rehoboth platform. They can choose to allocate a portion of their crypto holdings for savings, allowing Rehoboth to use these funds for yield generation activities.

2. Asset Allocation: Once enrolled, users can specify the assets they want to allocate for savings. These assets may include stablecoins like yUSDC or yXLM, which are suitable for generating yield through staking or other investment mechanisms.

3. Yield Generation Mechanisms: Rehoboth utilizes the staking of assets on Ultra Capital, participating in liquidity pools, or engaging in other yield-generating activities within the Stellar ecosystem. By leveraging these mechanisms, Rehoboth aims to maximize the yield potential of users' savings while minimizing associated risks.

4. Accrual of Rewards: As Rehoboth earns rewards through yield generation activities, the accrued rewards are credited to users' savings accounts on a regular basis. Users can track the growth of their savings and monitor the rewards earned over time.

5. Flexible Withdrawal Options: Users have the flexibility to withdraw their savings at any time, allowing them to access their funds whenever needed. Rehoboth ensures seamless withdrawal processes, enabling users to transfer their savings back to their primary wallets or use them for other purposes.

6. Transparent Reporting and Monitoring: Rehoboth provides users with transparent reporting and monitoring tools to track the performance of their savings accounts. Users can view detailed transaction histories, track accrued rewards, and monitor the overall growth of their savings portfolio within the platform. Overall, the savings feature in Rehoboth offers users a convenient and secure way to earn passive income on their crypto holdings while maintaining control over their assets. By integrating with yield generation mechanisms and providing flexible withdrawal options, Rehoboth empowers users to achieve their financial goals and build wealth over time.

How will this improve the Stellar community?

Communities: Rehoboth is a community-serving product that places the power of savings in the hands of the community and will empower African communities who will in turn, empower Stellar with more adoption. We intend to host meet-ups which will help the users gain more events.

Problems that Kript solves:

1. Merchant Payments: Kript allows merchants to generate payment checkout links that enable customers to pay using Stellar USDC, XLM. When a customer makes a payment using the checkout link, Kript automatically converts the received cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC or non-stable coins) into Stellar USDC, ensuring price stability for the merchant. Merchants can also receive payment directly in Stellar USDC via payment links. The merchant can then choose to keep the funds in Stellar USDC or seamlessly offramp them directly to their local bank account, reducing the risk of volatility and enabling quick access to fiat currency. This use case simplifies the payment process for merchants, expands their customer base to include cryptocurrency users, and reduces the costs and delays associated with traditional payment methods.

2. Remittances: Kript allows users to send cross-border payments using Stellar USDC or XLM, enabling fast and low-cost remittances. Senders can onramp their local fiat currency into Stellar USDC, specify the recipient's details, and initiate the remittance transaction. Kript handles the conversion of Stellar USDC to the recipient's local currency and offramps the funds directly to their bank account. By using Stellar's blockchain, Kript bypasses the intermediaries and high fees associated with traditional remittance services, making the process faster, cheaper, and more accessible to people. This use case is particularly beneficial for migrant workers, expatriates, and businesses with international operations, as it streamlines the remittance process and reduces costs.

Benefits:
1. Financial Inclusion: Kript promotes financial inclusion by enabling businesses to accept payments from customers who may not have access to traditional banking services.
2. Lower Transaction Costs: Stellar's low transaction fees can help businesses save on costs associated with traditional payment methods, especially for cross-border transactions.
3. Faster Settlement: Stellar's fast transaction speeds allow for quicker settlement of payments, benefiting both businesses and their customers.",,,https://kriptup.io,,https://youtu.be/Wl6DHQgxzYo?si=0vLKbAMCD5L7E4LH,,,,,,,Ayomide Lasaki,,,,,

Traditional finance is moving on-chain for efficiency. We’ve seen how Franklin Templeton launched its Franklin OnChain United States Government Money Fund with $BENJI on Stellar, and how KKR is tokenising a part of its private equity fund on Avalanche. Even BlackRock is launching its first tokenised fund on Ethereum. It’s not long before other institutions start following suit. The problem is, that the onboarding and verification processes (which include Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and accredited investor qualification) for new users are still based on the old Web2 approach: they’re repetitive, and manual. This is problematic to say the least, since 40% of potential users will abandon the onboarding process if it takes longer than ten minutes. This results in the loss of trillions of dollars (3.3 trillion in 2019 alone) of potential revenue. The need for a seamless, but compliant Web3 onboarding process with portable credentials is long overdue.

What Problems Are Tokenised Fund Institutions Facing?
Institutions need to keep investor fees as low as possible to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive market. This explains why so many of them are choosing to move on-chain. However, this is merely one part of the equation. High compliance costs are still a major source of concern since investors are just as likely to be alienated by expensive verification processes as they are by a clunky onboarding experience. Bringing acquisition costs down would ultimately result in higher conversion rates. Additionally, tokenised funds are still operating in a gated and siloed fashion. This greatly reduces the number of potential investors that can be acquired. A cross-chain approach would significantly increase this number.

What Are We Proposing?
0xAuth proposes a frictionless onboarding and verification process along with portable investor credentials — while boasting minimal compliance costs. The key features of our solution include:

A compliant, automated verification process: 0xAuth verifies accredited investors using trusted off-chain oracles in an automated fashion. This includes Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) checks via Plaid. Plaid enables investors to verify their real-world assets, such as bank and brokerage accounts, and undergo Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance and Political Exposed Person (PEP) screening. Additionally, 0xAuth leverages Vezgo, which allows investors to verify their digital assets such as crypto holdings, centralised exchange (CEX) and decentralised exchange (DEX) accounts, and non-fungible token (NFT) holdings.

Portable, verifiable credentials: 0xAuth deploys a digital identity contract (ERC-734) on-chain when a new user onboards for the first time. After the verification process is complete, the user is issued two verifiable credentials: off-chain, using the W3C VC standard, and on-chain, using the ERC-735 standard (which are linked to the user’s digital identity contract). We’ve explained the ERC-734 and ERC-735 standards in more detail in the next section.

Conditional wallet connectivity: If a platform (such as a private investment fund) wants to verify the user’s eligibility, it can simply integrate with 0xAuth and check their verifiable credentials to conditionally allow or block access.

Zero-knowledge proofs: If a platform needs to further verify a user’s personal information, it can utilise JSON-LD-based zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify off-chain (W3C) credentials. This approach allows for selective disclosure, enabling users to share specific pieces of information without revealing their entire identity or related data. As an example, an institution can request that a user verify their country of residence in order to provide them access to a private staking pool that is restricted to European residents. In the future, we’d like to allow these off-chain (W3C) credentials to be verified on-chain as well. In this case, we would deploy a ZKP verifier contract on the Stellar network. This contract would support criteria selection (ZK predicates) and selective disclosure requests. Any institutional contracts on the Stellar chain can simply call our contract to verify ZK proofs on-chain.

How Does Stellar Fit into the Picture?
We envision 0xAuth as the single sign-on (SSO) for a seamless, yet fully compliant, Web3 ecosystem. Our solution eliminates the need for siloed and gated environments typical in tokenised funds. With an eye toward a multi-chain future, 0xAuth is designed to facilitate the effortless movement of eligible investors across different blockchain networks while enabling institutions to attract and engage users from these diverse ecosystems. Incorporating support for Stellar-based tokenised funds into 0xAuth is a strategic move. By doing so, we aim to significantly expand the pool of potential investors for institutions like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, which are already utilising Stellar. Our included illustrations depict the envisioned integration and the benefits it brings.

How Can Stellar Benefit From Our Solution?
Stellar stands out as a premier blockchain for institutions looking to tokenise their investment funds thanks to its speed, low cost, and energy efficiency. By integrating 0xAuth, Stellar can enhance its appeal further by serving as a central hub for cross-chain activities: Enhanced Interoperability: With 0xAuth, Stellar can facilitate seamless identity verification across blockchains, reinforcing its position as a bridge within the multi-chain ecosystem. Compliance as a Service: Leveraging 0xAuth’s compliance tools on Stellar not only simplifies the compliance challenges for tokenised funds, but also turns Stellar into a compliance hub for cross-chain RWA transactions. Stellar as a Market Expander: By reducing compliance friction in cross-chain transactions, Stellar can attract a broader range of institutional participants and eligible investors, boosting its overall ecosystem activity and liquidity. Exclusive Features for Stellar Users: We plan to develop custom features for Stellar on 0xAuth, which include institutional dashboards, audit trails, and enhanced security protocols specifically tailored to meet the needs of institutional users. By enabling these capabilities, 0xAuth will help solidify Stellar's role as a leading network for tokenised assets, broadening its user base and enhancing its operational ecosystem.

How Will We Implement the Required Standards on Stellar?
As mentioned above, we’ll use the ERC-734 and ERC-735 standards for our proposed solution. These are Ethereum standards proposed for managing on-chain identities. ERC734, or the ""identity"" standard, outlines how identities can be created, queried, and managed, allowing entities like individuals, organisations, and machines to have an on-chain presence through identity contracts. These contracts can hold claims and be controlled by one or more key managers. ERC735, on the other hand, complements this by defining how claims can be added, removed, or changed within these identity contracts. It specifies the methods for making claims about an identity, which claim issuers can validate. All ERC standards essentially propose a set of methods (or functions) that must be implemented. As such, we’ll implement the same methods and leverage custom types and data structures using the Rust language via Soroban. This way, we’ll be “porting over” the ERC standard to the Stellar chain. Additionally, we’ll use the Deployer feature for straightforward setup and initialisation of the required identity contracts, the Auth feature to secure operations and access (ensuring that only authorised actions are allowed), and the Events feature to track and announce changes in claims for transparency and ease of auditing. This approach will enable us to create a functional and secure identity verification system on Stellar.",,,https://0xauth.co/,,https://docsend.com/v/yrmz2/0xauth-tokenized-funds,,,,,,,"Rico van der Veen, Zohaib Adnan",,,,,

The product consists of a reputation aggregator system that utilizes Stellar badges and on-chain data, prioritizing contribution over plutocracy in DAOs and digital organizations governance, fostering engagement, and encouraging fair collaboration across organizations. The current approach of relying on token ownership for voting and participation has led to decreased community engagement among members. Additionally, individuals are less motivated to join new communities, fearing the time and effort it would take to establish their reputation from the ground up. Trustful is a verifiable and interoperable reputation dApp that addresses these challenges by establishing a framework where contributions as a Stellar community member are acknowledged. This system empowers members to influence the community they are dedicated to, not based only on economic power or tokens they possess but on the level of their commitment and efforts towards the community's future (Valocracy). A pioneering use case in the realm of reputation narrative.

What problems it solves, how it solves them, and what audience it solves them for (explain the benefits):

Problems addressed and Solutions:

1. Verifiable track record of past contributions and Valocracy
1.1 Absence of a history: make your story count and enhance your on-chain reputation with all past collaborations
1.2 Arbitrariness in role selection decisions: assign roles to those with more knowledge and building experience in specific areas, basing decisions on verifiable reputation – contribution-based role assignment
1.3 Certain Stellar Badges from the quests are tradable, enabling the badge-earning effort to be bought or sold, essentially invalidating any reputation tracking. Since quests are individual and showcase efforts, the solution would be the “soulbinding” of these badges, preventing the splitting of these efforts and encouraging the community to view them as active participation in the ecosystem rather than assets for buying and selling.

2. Coordination, Interoperability and Modularity
2.1 Lack of interoperability between ecosystems: portability matters, so take your Stellar reputation forward, participate in other communities, and show them what you've built on Stellar
2.2 Plutocracy and voting turnout: value valocracy, make your participation and contributions valuable and important; currently, governance tokens lead this front and are still based on monetary power and not always on contribution
2.3 Bribery: when we have a non-transferable reputation based on our verifiable contributions, bribery becomes harder.
2.4 Absence of an equitable community currency: a community coin can be created taking reputation into account; economic value may be considered, but reputation can be part of the governance equation
2.5 Voting system based only on token holdings amount: reputational systems, combined with delegate and time-stamp systems, can lead to a better equitative model for voting systems in digital organizations, by weighting the voting power by who are fit by reputation in the ecosystem, not only the amount of holdings.

3. High-quality community engagement and recognition
3.1 Lack of engagement: the ease of tracking progress stimulates increased engagement and optimal decision-making based on a unit with high reputation in a specific area

Most importantly, how it works and how it uses Stellar and/or Soroban:

Trustful is divided into two main branches: the badge issuers and the reputation scorers. The Badge Issuer allows the user to attest the ownership of assets they have and activity they’ve done, giving them a second “non-tradable asset”, which carries the necessary standard information for validating the holder’s reputation. For its initial version, Trustful will operate with a limited set of assets to verify, looking only at assets from: Stellar Quests, Soroban Quests, RPCiege, FCA00C, dApp Quests, and Okashi Cakewalk. The Reputation Scorer allows users to determine a list of “badge:multiplier” pairs, where they can determine what matters for their communities and give it the needed weight. Once a Scorer is created, it becomes openly available for anyone to use for checking one or multiple addresses' Reputation Scores against it. For its first version, the Scorers will be limited to checking assets issued on Trustful, with the same scope used for the Badge Issuer.

Why Stellar?

The main goal of Stellar is to make “blockchain meets the real world”, unlocking human and economic power. Our product aligns with this by connecting economic power to human efforts, by creating a system that allows organizations to fairly reward community members. With this use case, we position Stellar (a ready ecosystem to implement this use case) as a leader in human coordination within the decentralized space, reinforcing its ecosystem's leadership in the emerging narrative of reputation. “The Stellar Community Fund (SCF) is taking a significant step forward with its collaboration with BlockScience to develop Neural Quorum Governance (NQG).” [Source: https://medium.com/stellar-community/scfs-implementation-of-nqg-on-mainnet-open-source-08ca1656cfc8] – Stellar is also at the forefront of development and advancement in governance, with part of this study and development also involving reputation. The Product Manager from Blockful's team participated in a Blockscience community call to discuss GML and the reputation product (Trustful). With the utilization of Soroban and Stellar Badges, we have a ready-to-go use case to showcase to the decentralized community how aggregated reputation with scores can function for community rewards, governance, participation in open-source projects, and even for DeFi usage (imagine if DeFi protocols, in the future, start requiring lower collateral for loans for those with high reputation?). Stellar offers robust governance tools, enhancing its appeal. Additionally, Soroban's documentation is accessible, and the Stellar community facilitated the efficient creation of this use case. Creating a reputation system will bring the ecosystem of DAOs and governance researches to the Stellar environment, enhancing the range of use cases for the GML – Objective: To bootstrap collaboration on governance modules within and beyond the Stellar ecosystem through an accessible and agnostic library, contributing to a sustainable and representative governance of our digital future.

To offer standardized, compatible services, Anchors must implement a whole series of Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. As an anchor, the most important SEPs are SEP-10: Stellar Authentication, SEP-12: KYC API, SEP-38: Anchor RFQ API, SEP-6: Programmatic Deposit and Withdrawal, SEP-24: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal, SEP-31: Cross Border Payments API, and SEP-08: Regulated Assets.

The open-source PHP Anchor SDK helps PHP developers to implement the Client - Anchor interaction by abstracting the Stellar-specific functionality defined in the SEPs. The SDK is composed of two components: a Service Layer Library implementing the Stellar specific functionality described in the corresponding SEPs, and an open-source Reference Server implementation that uses the library.

The library is published on Packagist, the main PHP Packages Repository, and can be freely used in any PHP project. The Reference Server implementation serves as an example project, demonstrating the interaction with the library but can also be easily extended to implement the real business logic.

We have already successfully implemented support for the most important SEPs. This includes support for SEP-01, SEP-06, SEP-09, SEP-10, SEP-12, SEP-24, SEP-31, and SEP-31. In the next phase, we would like to implement support for SEP-08 and then focus on important features like the implementation of callback mechanisms, transactions watcher, event handling, localization, and logging.

One of DappRadar's strengths lies in its dedication to educating visitors about multiple blockchains, including popular ones like ETH, BNB, and Polygon, among others. By providing comprehensive data and insights on dapps and the corresponding blockchain platforms, one of the main challenges dapp users can experience is discovering new applications, whether it be for work, play, or investment. They need to use a plethora of disparate tools to find what they are looking for. For example, browsing through X, going to various Discord channels or just simply searching on the web. Even then, surface level research often does not yield important information about dapps such as, for example, how active a dapp is. While activity is possible to denote through a block explorer, that requires technical knowledge, creating a barrier for many potential users. DappRadar is built with the pure intention of dapp discovery, allowing users to find new applications simply, understand how they perform, and use them. DappRadar does not focus on a specific vertical or category. If a user wants to learn about blockchain gaming, NFTs and DeFi, there is no need for them to use three different platforms. All their needs can be fulfilled by simply using DappRadar. Our product aims to enhance Soroban in the following ways: Attract new users and developers: by integrating on DappRadar, Soroban will be featured alongside 60 other chains, allowing DappRadar’s highly specialized audience, as well as its developer community, to discover Soroban and its dapps. Performance comparison: Soroban dapp users and developers can compare their performance with others in the industry using DappRadar's rankings. Increased traffic to dapps: on average DappRadar sends approximately one million users a month to dapps across all of its integrated chains. Media exposure: DappRadar's articles and reports highlighting positive protocol activity have been quoted by top blockchain media, providing additional exposure for Soroban and its ecosystem. Overall, integrating Soroban on DappRadar will bring new users, provide performance insights, drive traffic, engage experienced builders, offer gaming metrics, showcase activity, and generate media exposure, enhancing the Soroban and its dapp ecosystem. To complete the integration, the DappRadar team will use nodes or blockchain APIs to collect Soroban’s raw blockchain data. Afterwards, the data will be indexed and displayed on DappRadar’s rankings page. The goal of the integration is to track the main DappRadar metrics: UAW (unique active wallets), dapps incoming volume to smart contracts, number of transactions in smart contracts and token balances on smart contracts.",,,https://dappradar.com/,-,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVvtpxWNWs,,,,,,,Rimas Jonusauskas,,,https://x.com/dappradar,https://discord.com/invite/4ybbssrHkm,

This initiative is critical because security flaws in smart contracts have led to billion-dollar losses in recent years. Traditional methods like testing and code review are insufficient, as they cannot cover all inputs and often overlook issues. Instead, we propose an approach based on formal verification to ensure correctness and security of smart contracts. Formal verification leverages rigorous mathematical proofs to eliminate entire classes of bugs and vulnerabilities, beyond the capabilities of traditional testing. A verified contract will always behave as expected even in the presence of malicious actors, ensuring that it has no bugs or vulnerabilities that could cost millions or even billions of dollars.

We will leverage our decades of expertise in formal verification to improve security in Soroban contracts with Formal VerSo (Formal Verification of Soroban contracts). The project will develop formal verification tooling by extending Galois’s Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) with support specific for verifying smart contracts on the Soroban platform. This will allow users of the Soroban platform to ensure their contracts are correct and secure before deploying them. In the decades of developing SAW, Galois has verified critical pieces of software, including Amazon’s S2N cryptography library currently used by hundreds of millions of people. During the activation award, we demonstrated that SAW can be used to formally verify simple Soroban contracts that make straightforward use of just the Soroban storage API. This was done by using SAW’s Rust verification capability and a model of the storage API.

In the upcoming phase, we plan to continue increasing our coverage of the Soroban SDK in the contracts that SAW can verify. This involves incorporating specifications and reasoning principles for various features, including custom types, authentication and authorization and cross contract invocations. Also, since we are now more familiar with the verification process of Soroban contracts, we’ll start paving the way towards a more user-friendly tool with better error reports and better interaction.

Subsequent stages of our work will focus on further expanding our support for the SDK to include more of its features. We also want to start exploring how to make the tool usable and useful for the community. Our overarching objective is to validate the effectiveness of our tool by verifying a real-world, intricate protocol such as the pool-factory of the Blend Protocol. We have engaged with Script3 to start the conversations and plan towards that goal.

It is a powerful tool for enabling secure and controlled transaction scheduling in the blockchain space. Protocols that have decentralized governance implement timelocks into their contract functions to prevent contract admins/owners from maliciously making contract changes without prior notice. Approved proposals also use a timelock so that users have sufficient time to prepare for contract changes.

The TimelockController is usually paired with role-based access controls (RBAC) such that only certain types of users may invoke specific functions within the contract. An AccessControl contract allows the specification and CRUD of one or more roles.

OpenZeppelin has created the canonical timelock functionality for Solidity and EVM applications. We aim to do the same for Soroban applications. The main functions of the Soroban timelock contract are to enable the scheduling and execution of one or more transactions, specify a minimum time span (tdelay) between the initial scheduling (tschedule) and the execution of the function (texecution), as well as set the roles of proposer, executor, canceller. texecution - tschedule >= tdelay.

It's important to note here that we cannot simply translate the Solidity OpenZeppelin timelock contracts into Rust/Soroban. Because Soroban has a different set of logic governing the maximum size of a contract, we have found in our research and development that many complex functions will fail, as maximum contract sizes are limited and external contract calls look to be expensive relative to how things operate for EVM execution.

Once we have created this timelock contract, we will work with the Stellar foundation to help spread awareness and get adoption from developers so that this can be a core contract build block going forward.",,,N/A,,,,,,,,,Kevin Wang,,,,,

The JS Worker SDK solves all three issues with a very lightweight SDK built on modern standards, with no dependencies for most usage. Its module lazy-loading design means that reading the Horizon API can be done with a 3.5kB browser download weight and the use of only pure browser standards allows for drop-in compatibility for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and WinterJS (which runs on Wasmer Edge).

Some quick examples of usage for the Horizon API module:

// include the SDK with a connection to the test network
import { horizon } from './horizon.js?network=test'

// grab a single page of 10 transaction records as an array
const setOfTenTransactions = await horizon.get.transactions()

// start listing out all transactions with automatic pagination
for await (const t of horizon.stream.transactions()) console.log(t)

// start an EventSource based listener to fire an event when new transactions are posted
const { listener: transactions } = await horizon.listen.transactions()
transactions.addEventListener('message', event => console.log(event.data))

// submit a transaction
const secretKey = 'S...', transaction = { ... }
const { response } = await horizon.submit(transaction, secretKey)

JavaScript is arguably the most important language to have a modern SDK available for, as it is uniquely able to address both front and back end integrations. Front-end integrations especially require the option of a lightweight SDK for simpler use cases, as well as having unavoidable performance concerns which can deeply inform the choice of SDKs and tools. The JS Worker SDK solves this problem, creating one lightweight, universally compatible, and performant SDK for JavaScript applications.

The JS Worker SDK is architected from first-principle with strict web standards compliance, and is optimized for maximum performance and minimum footprint.

It serves as a dynamic ecosystem where developers can come together to learn, solve problems, compete, collaborate, and build innovative solutions. Currently, the platform has 40,000+ active web3 developers, learning, solving challenges, contests, tutorials, building profiles, etc. Along with active users, we have a community of more than 60k users and the presence of over 50+ universities in India. We also got accepted into Ethindia grants, we partnered with multiple companies like Push Protocol, Aptos, QuillAudits, StackOS, Vechain, Revise, Dapps, and more.

Last week, we built 20+ projects on Stellar with multiple groups within our community as we partnered with Rise In to assist them in the Soroban Stellar Accelerator by leveraging our skilled developers community. These developers came from diverse backgrounds, ranging from beginners to experts. In Web3 space most developers are from Ethereum or Solana backgrounds. However, they found transitioning to Stellar development challenging due to a lack of resources for learning and understanding the platform. Soroban, despite using Rust, presents a different set of challenges, especially development flow and Soroban working, along with these major challenges, developers struggle with overall dapp development. This further complicates matters as detailed resources for Stellar development are lacking, making it difficult for developers to grasp the intricacies of building on the Stellar network. The best way to build and strengthen the developer community is to have little to no friction while building, by providing them with high-quality resources for smooth building. This problem also leads to an influx of developer queries in Stellar community channels, overwhelming the Stellar team with repeated questions and doubts.

Our team has been developing resources and dapps for the past 5 years in the ecosystem from Ethereum, Polygon's POS Plasma to building games on Lens, we have built very comprehensive courses with our experience and expertise. So far we have provided 15+ different courses, 30+ quizzes, 60+ challenges, 16+ contests, and 400+ tutorials and guides, i.e overall 400+ hrs of web3 learning on the platform. Our proposed solution involves leveraging DApp World's resources to create high-quality free courses that will serve the Stellar community. These educational resources will simplify the learning process for developers, reduce the number of queries from developers during dapp development, and ultimately, enhance the Stellar community's capacity to build on Stellar. The learning track will include certified courses, quizzes, and articles to create a comprehensive learning ecosystem around Stellar. These resources will be simultaneously updated to reflect changes in the Stellar blockchain and ensure that developers remain up to date with the platform's upgrades.

In addition to educating developers, the introduction of this Stellar learning track will serve as a valuable resource for Stellar events and workshops. It will serve as a comprehensive guide, helping developers get started with Stellar more easily and efficiently. These resources, produced over time, will meet the requirements of any developer, from beginners to experts. By focusing on Stellar, we can introduce these resources to various communities, including those we are building in India. This will, over time, accelerate the pace at which developers jump into the Stellar ecosystem.",,,https://dapp-world.com,,https://youtu.be/V9QZ800SuU8,,,,,,,Aniket S,,,,,

With the support of advanced features such as tranches, first loss cover, modular structured finance, fee manager, profit and loss manager, and 30/360 calendar, Huma V2 is one of the most sophisticated business lending protocols live today. Huma V2 contracts feature 6000+ lines of Solidity code. Besides the sophistication in its smart contracts, Huma also has advanced infrastructure for on-chain transparency and credit risk management. For different use cases, developers can build adapters for Decentralized Signal Portfolio and Evaluation Agent to leverage various on-chain and off-chain signals for credit underwriting and ongoing risk management. Our transparency layer allows businesses to present the life cycle of their receivables on-chain to give investors full visibility with the health of the underlying assets. (Note: the integration with Decentralized Signal Portfolio and Evaluation Agent will be covered in a separate award application in Phase 3.)

Arf is one of the most powerful use cases on the Huma platform. It provides on-demand liquidity to cross-border remittance financial institutions to free them from the heavy burden of pre-funding. Since loans originated by Arf have a very short duration of 1-6 days, Arf can turnover capital very quickly. With a facility of $16M, including capital support from SDF, Arf has achieved $1.3B+ on-chain transaction volume with zero default in the last 500 days and proved itself as one of the most exciting on-chain real world lending use cases (Dune dashboard). So far, Huma and Arf are live on EVM chains such as Polygon and Celo despite Stellar being a key liquidity provider to Arf. This project is to develop and launch Huma and Arf smart contracts on Stellar and Soroban. Since Arf can turnover capital 50 times a year, with borrowing and repayment transactions, the existing liquidity from Stellar and others will generate $1B transaction volume on Stellar and Soroban within 12 months after the project goes live. The project will not only massively improve Soroban's transaction volume, but also aligns with Stellar's vision extremely well.

Since Huma is a complicated protocol, given that Soroban is relatively new, it is expected for us to encounter feature gaps and hit limitations of Soroban infrastructure. We view giving feedback to the Soroban core team as one of the best ways for us to contribute to Soroban and the broader ecosystem. We have been in close contact with Jake Urban from SDF to document these gaps, explore workarounds or figure out a plan to build the missing pieces.",,,huma.finance,"Soroban source code is not open sourced yet.

These assets include ETH, stETH (anchored to Lido’s stETH) and AAVE’s aUSDC, aUSDT, and aWBTC, each designed to bridge Stellar with the Ethereum ecosystem.

Problems Addressed & Solutions Provided:

Limited Access to Yield-Generating Opportunities: Solution: By introducing assets like stETH and aUSDC, Aquarius offers Stellar users exposure to Ethereum's DeFi yields directly on the Stellar network. This expands financial opportunities for users who can now earn yields from Ethereum protocols without leaving the Stellar ecosystem.

Complexity in Handling Crypto Assets Across Blockchains: Solution: The assets act as bridges, simplifying the complex process of moving funds between Stellar and Ethereum. Users can now interact with Ethereum-based yield protocols while enjoying the low fees and fast transaction speeds of Stellar.

High Custodial Risks: Solution: Shifting from a classic custodial model on Stellar to decentralized assets on Soroban reduces the regulatory and security risks associated with handling user funds directly.

Real-Time Yield Updates: Solution: Through the integration of a rebase mechanism and oracle updates, users will see their balances update in real-time directly within their wallets, mirroring the yield accruals seen on Ethereum.

Audience & Benefits:

Crypto Enthusiasts and DeFi Investors: Users seeking passive income through crypto assets can now access diverse yield options without managing multiple wallets or navigating complex cross-chain transfers.

Stellar Community: Enhancing the utility and appeal of the Stellar network by integrating it more deeply with the broader DeFi ecosystem, which may attract more users and developers to Stellar.

Functionality and Integration with Stellar/Soroban:

Minting and Burning Mechanisms: Utilizing Soroban smart contracts, Aquarius will automate the minting and burning of anchored assets. For example, when users deposit native stETH for stETH on Stellar, the corresponding stETH tokens are minted through a smart contract and vice versa for burning.

Oracle Integration for Yield Updates and Rebase Mechanism: Integrate with Ethereum’s rebase mechanisms via an oracle (like Reflector) to monitor and verify updates in the yield generated on Ethereum-based assets like stETH and aUSDC. This ensures that Stellar assets are updated in real-time to reflect changes in their Ethereum counterparts. Oracle data is secured by a decentralized network of trusted nodes, ensuring that yield updates are both accurate and tamper-proof.

Decentralized Financial Operations: The assets will participate in yield-generating activities by interacting with established Ethereum protocols like Lido for staking and Aave for lending. Soroban's capabilities allow these interactions to be programmed into the smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.

Interoperability Facilitation: By creating a seamless link between Stellar and Ethereum, these assets enable fluidity of capital across the ecosystems, reducing barriers for users who wish to leverage opportunities across both platforms.",,,https://aqua.network/,https://github.com/AquaToken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMtEKc106pw,,,,,,,Jason Cudmore,,,https://twitter.com/aqua_token,https://discord.gg/sgzFscHp4C,

By simplifying web3 for the less tech and financial savvy, we intend to increase utilization of financial products across sub-Saharan Africa. The “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many, especially in the informal sector, from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends. Furthermore, data penetration is still very low in Africa, thus by packaging our solution through the USSD channel we could reach more than half a billion users. This simple, and mostly ignored telco asset could help push Web3 mass-market adoption, not only in Africa but anywhere with no internet access.

This submission will focus on integrating two of our core products to the Stellar ecosystem: Clixpesa Spaces and Clixpesa P2P Lending.

Clixpesa Spaces is basically a savings feature where users can save for personal goals, participate in saving challenges, and also save in groups through RoSCAs. With Rotating Savings & Credit Associations (RoSCAs), users can come together as a group to help each other stay financially resilient. Users contribute to a pot, and the target amount goes to one of the users in a particular order until everyone has received a pot and the cycle starts over. This utility, commonly known in Kenya as Chamas, helps many raise funds for otherwise big financial goals such as business capital or bills. Within the RoSCAs, members can also ask for financial support for financial needs outside of the pot allocations.

Many of the unbanked and underbanked in sub-Saharan Africa utilize traditional financial methods to stay financially resilient. Many of these methods are manual, offline, and require a great deal of trust for all involved. We begin by bringing the utility of RoSCAs to web3 and online as this has stood out as the most straightforward means of saving among our communities. While RoSCAs have proven to be efficient, many are plagued with short life spans as they tend to break off after a few rounds, and internal wrangles and flight funds arise. Furthermore, some members drop off along the contribution cycle, hence breaking the chain of contributions.

Our platform helps solve these problems by offering a trustless way to save together and manage the RoSCAs. Through automated contributions, reminders, transparent transaction histories, pot allocations, and rotating signatories, the platform evens out the skill level required to manage a RoSCA and hence even the non-financial savvy member claims some level of control on their RoSCA.

Users can create a RoSCA easily by inviting their friends through their phone numbers. A user comes up with a group name, the pot allocation they have agreed upon, and selects members from their contact list. This information is then used to create a new smart contract on Soroban, and the smart contract acts as the RoSCA with all the necessary logic needed to run the RoSCA. Members then receive an invitation to join the RoSCA and after all members have joined, signatories are assigned, and a pot allocation is created. Members can then start contributing to the RoSCA by sending and locking funds on the deployed smart contract. Upon a deadline or pot allocation being filled, it is automatically sent to the pot's bearer, and a new pot is created with the next member in line. Members can appeal to appear next and here the signatories can sign upon this change. Signatories are also needed for any emergency withdrawals from the RoSCA or changes that require the whole group to agree upon. Signatories are also rotated in order to ensure everyone has power in the direction the RoSCA takes.

Clixpesa P2P Lending offers an avenue for users to request microloans on their own terms. 68% of loans in the alternative lending market in Africa are P2P loans. Clixpesa helps with creating and monitoring the credit scores of users and only recommending matches to users in order to minimize the risk of default among users. This feature is very useful for those who survive on day loans to run small businesses for purposes such as inventory purchases.

Digital mobile loan lenders and traditional shylocks have made it impossible for low-income earners to access quick loans due to predatory interest rates. Those who have no alternative and end up settling for these loans end up in a pile of debt not because they are not financially organized but mainly because the loan was too expensive in the long run. This leads to the loss of the small assets they have or even the failure of their small businesses.

This product greatly reduces the cost of loans as it democratizes lending while also opening other earning avenues for users through interest. Users can negotiate on the interest rates with their peers and since it's an open marketplace for loans, interest rates will go down as lenders look to attract more borrowers.

On Soroban, two smart contracts are deployed, one for loan offers and requests and another for active loans. When a user creates a loan request or offer, this information is stored in the smart contract and once another initiates a loan from the offers or requests, the active loan is updated in the loans contract. This contract tracks the terms of the loan, payment schedules, and any payment history between the parties involved. The creditor will then be asked to fund the loan by sending funds to the user via the Stellar protocol. Once funds are received, the loan schedule is updated and interest calculated and updated. Clixpesa smart contracts will be responsible for sending reminders to loans and calculating credit scores based on user loan behavior. This credit score is essential in matching loan participants.

Everyone wants more from their money, however, only a few financial savvies understand how to. Easy, frictionless, and accessible financial products are necessary to make them work for as many individuals as possible. To be inclusive, low-income earners and struggling small businesses need tools that put them in control of their money and unlock more ways to realize their potential.

Our initial target market is in Kenya, with plans to roll out in East Africa and later the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Many in the informal sector in Kenya underutilize financial products due to high learning curves, costs, and the commitment involved. While making payments is easy, participating in mediums that expose them to cheap lines of credit and saving pools still has high friction.",,,https://clixpesa.com/,https://github.com/clixpesa,https://youtu.be/MvFuiixrV4E,,,,,,,Samuel Moyi,,,,,

Additionally, it enables crypto holders to pay for utility services and settle their related bills using cryptocurrencies. Currently operating in 6 African countries, we help merchants engaging in international trade and individuals who send remittances to family and friends with a cost-effective and instant payment alternative.

Africans contend with high transaction fees, delayed payments, and accessibility issues associated with existing payment systems. Businesses and individuals pay up to 15% of transaction fees of transaction value and sometimes have to wait up to 3 days when sending money home or making cross-border payments.

How does it work?

Businesses / Merchants: For merchants to accept cross-border payments, they create a unique paylink that specifies the amount to be paid. These links are shared with the intended payer using communication channels such as emails or WhatsApp. Once the recipient clicks on the paylink, it directs them to the interface to make payment with a blockchain network of their choice and address to send stablecoins. Once a transaction is complete, the amount equivalent to stablecoins paid is deposited into the paylink creator's fiat wallet for withdrawal into mobile money or banks.

Individuals / P2P remittances: To make payments, users deposit fiat from their mobile money or banks. Using an account number to credit payments, the amount paid is on-ramped into stablecoins and the equivalent value is credited into the specified account number wallet for withdrawal. Alternatively, users have the option of using a default paylink associated with their account. In this case, payers can utilize the paylink to deposit stablecoins, and the equivalent value will be credited to the paylink wallet.

Utility payments and bill settlements: Users use their assets held in their wallet to pay for utility services or settle bills such as electricity, mobile airtime or data, TV subscription, etc.",,,https://pretium.africa,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Xp2ejrFhc,,,,,,,Derrick Bundi,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-bundi/,,,

We believe this reinforces our vision to provide the persons around the world the ability to leverage gold as an asset of stabilization and security amidst uncertain times:

Original Submission

Storehouse Gold offers a platform which specifically provides gold as a tokenized real world asset. Our platform launched in 2023 and utilized the Polygon network and ERC compliant smart contracts (specifically ERC-721 and ERC-20 for our two token types.)

Tokenized gold provides individuals in the emerging world that are subjected to the risks of weak currencies, needing to travel and remit funds back ""home"", risks of having their physical money stolen, and so many other scenarios that the modern ""west"" does not encounter. By tokenizing gold, Storehouse can offer a path for individuals almost anywhere worldwide to convert their wealth into tokenized gold assets that can be remitted, traded, bartered, or redeemed.

Our method of token redeeming and liquidity is unique in the industry, and provides both the user as well as the gold providers the ability to maintain utmost security in any of our partnering hubs in different regions around the world.

Since our product was built on Polygon, we faces on-ramping and off-ramping limitations. With the emergence of Soroban and being able to leverage more efficient and powerful smart contracts across the stellar network, the solution to our product was simple.

After our conversion, users around the world in compliant regions will more easily be able to convert fiat to stable-coins for both the purchasing and selling of their tokenized assets in nearly real time.

This is something that Polygon can offer, but nowhere near as efficient or with the same growing infrastructure as Stellar.

Wagent,SCF #26,Wagent,Wagent,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recyhHu5bchmieL0C,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$43400.00,$43400.00,395911.70,5/7/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Offers merchants effortless reception and management of crypto payments and easy checkout for the buyers.,"What is the product?

Wagent is a decentralized payment gateway within the Stellar and Futurenet networks. Beyond simplifying payment processes, Wagent offers powerful features tailored to meet the needs of merchants and buyers. Wagent provides a streamlined payment process, allowing buyers to select different payment options: direct, stream, or vesting, catering to diverse buyer preferences. This not only enhances revenue potential for the merchant but also opens new avenues for growth and global reach. Moreover, Wagent's integration with the Fluxity protocol ensures secure and trustless payments, empowering buyers to manage their financial commitments effectively. Wagent provides seamless integration with popular e-commerce platforms through plugins for Presta, Magento, OpenCart, WordPress, and Shopify, ensuring effortless adoption and compatibility for merchants across various platforms. Wagent introduces automated conversion of payment tokens into the merchant's chosen currency. For instance, if a buyer selects XLM to pay for a product, Wagent seamlessly swaps incoming tokens to the merchant’s desired tokens before transferring them to the merchant's address, ensuring a smooth and convenient experience for both parties. Furthermore, Wagent streamlines the payout process for merchants with automated receiving of different tokens. Merchants no longer need to manually trigger functions or click buttons to access accumulated funds from buyers. Instead, Wagent's fully automated system ensures that merchants receive their earnings effortlessly, enhancing operational efficiency and convenience for businesses of all sizes.

What problem does it solve? How does it solve them? And what audience it solves them for (explain the benefits)

Wagent addresses the complexities and inefficiencies often associated with online transactions by offering a range of solutions tailored for both merchants and buyers within the Stellar and Futurenet networks. The Stellar Network is designed for financial purposes and it has great potential to be a widespread solution for crypto payments, but it lacks in having a fully decentralized automated payment gateway in which merchants would easily install plugins and integrate them and also let buyers purchase products and services. Due to Stellar’s fast, reliable, and cost-effective nature, Merchants can get a great deal compared to centralized solutions without any formalities. Wagent allows merchants to accept various tokens, giving buyers the freedom to choose their preferred method of payment. Wagent would then convert these tokens into a single token chosen by the merchant, aiming to simplify the payment process. It's worth noting that while centralized payment gateways often charge significant fees, ranging from 2% to 3% of the transaction amount, our platform operates on the Stellar and FutureNet networks, which offer fast and low-fee transactions. This means that buyers using our platform do not need to pay as much in fees compared to traditional payment gateways, resulting in cost savings for both buyers and merchants.

How it works and how it uses Stellar/Soroban?

Underneath the hood, Wagent utilizes proxy smart contracts to manage transactions in a trustless manner. These contracts handle various payment options such as direct payments, streaming, or vesting, enabling flexibility for both buyers and merchants. Upon completion of a transaction, Wagent's automated system ensures that merchants receive their earnings promptly, without the need for manual intervention. Furthermore, Wagent leverages the Fluxity protocol for streaming payments, locking tokens in a smart contract vault, and unlocking portions of funds incrementally over time. This feature grants buyers the flexibility to cancel subscriptions at any time while providing merchants with a steady revenue stream. Additionally, Wagent seamlessly bridges transactions between the Stellar and FutureNet networks, allowing buyers to utilize their preferred network for payment while ensuring seamless cross-network transactions for merchants. Wagent's backend infrastructure seamlessly converts incoming tokens into the user's preferred currency through a sophisticated process. Leveraging on-chain decentralized liquidity pools, Wagent efficiently swaps user tokens, ensuring optimal prices and liquidity. Even if the token originates from the Stellar network, Wagent intelligently identifies the best prices, executes swaps, and seamlessly bridges the tokens to meet user preferences.",,,https://wagent.app,https://github.com/fluxitystellar,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u828UpVjw8,,,,,,,"Ceyda Esen, Ruveyda Kışla",,,https://x.com/wagentofficial,,

We have accumulated 30 million online users and 1,500 creators on our Web2 App. The story-gameplay (also known as Script-Murder) is becoming popular in recent years. Based on the story, the player acts as one of the story roles, and interacts with others to achieve the ultimate goal from the first-person perspective. It is characterized by the strong immersion, content-based, social networking attributes, etc. Moreover, this new gaming form can empower various industries, such as the film industry and tourism industry, and expand their influence in a novel way.

However, with the rapid growing of the story-gameplay industry, it encounters several issues which need to be solved urgently, for example: The creation efficiency is low. It takes a professional creator two months to produce a new story, which will affect the content quantity; The creators only get a small part of the story selling; The players have no way to be profitable; The piracy is rampant, which will affect the creation enthusiasm; The story price cannot be correlated with actual popularity. The price is controlled by publisher, not by the freedom market mechanism.

These issues limit the development of the whole industry. We believe that the content creators and players need to receive more incentives in the whole economic system as they contribute their innovative ideas and active participation to the whole system. We found that the Web3 and AIGC technology are very suitable to solve the problem and can give an explosive growth for high quality contents.",,,https://findtruman.io,,https://youtu.be/mjcPf1sQ6Sk ,,,,,,,Longfeng Hou,,,https://twitter.com/FindTruman,https://discord.com/invite/vrUjMWsjAj,

The SDF has done a great job in building the Stellar Disbursement Platform as a solution to this problem. However, after speaking with businesses that benefit from this solution, we have identified that as it stands, it’s too complex for them to use it. Their main issues are:

- Having to create a Stellar public key
- Having to buy stablecoins somewhere
- Managing private keys in a secure way without too much complexity
- Requiring dev resources to set up their own instance of the SDP
- Having to research potential wallet partners

P’aid is a payroll and aid distribution SaaS solution built on top of the SDP. Within P’aid, businesses will be able to:

- Create an account effortlessly without requiring dev resources
- Manage private keys through SEP 30 without any complexity, including 2FA
- Deposit their local currency easily directly in the UI
- Preselected wallet partners based on their payout needs
- Payout without having to create a Stellar wallet or buy XLM as the platform will sponsor all balances and fees
- In the future: Set recurring payouts via a Soroban integration

Problems It Solves, How It Solves Them, and Target Audience: P’aid focuses on businesses that payout funds to a diverse international audience, be that companies with an international workforce, aid organizations, or web3 companies with a global development team. These companies run into high transfer costs and long transfer times. Blockchain and more specifically the SDP can help them solve this. However, we have identified that potential users still experience too many hurdles, as described above. We will abstract away things like running your own SDP instance, managing private keys, paying for minimum balances and fees, depositing funds into the platform, and in general build a UI that these businesses can understand and use.

How It Works and Utilization of Stellar: P’aid will realize a seamless user experience by integrating Stellar in the following way:

- Multi-tenant architecture built on top of the SDP: Users create an account inside P’aid and don’t need any dev resources themselves.
- Fee bumps and reserve sponsoring: Users that create a P’aid account are given a Stellar wallet with sponsored reserves so that they don’t have to do this themselves. They also won’t require you to purchase XLM to pay for any fees.
- Users will be able to deposit funds directly inside the UI via banking partners, integrated via SEP 6/24 or API.
- Automatic wallet recommendation: Based on the geographic location of the recipients, the platform will recommend a wallet partner. No need to research this as a business yourself.
- Companies will not have to manage their own Stellar public key and private keys. With SEP 30 we will offer them seamless 2FA. We are also researching account abstraction by the use of Soroban for this purpose.
- Preferred currency based on the location of the business, which connects the company with local anchors to deposit funds into the platform.
- Using Soroban to schedule payroll disbursements.

We will contribute to the open-source SDP where relevant. However, we will also require building our own back-end to, for example, save a business’ preferred currency, available anchors, connection between anchors and fiat currencies, deposit statuses, available Stellar currencies, etc.",,,www.p-aid.world,,https://youtu.be/iCGtoFG-bEc,,,,,,,"Thomas Luijken, Bas Jan Lubbers",,,,,

You'd also need to follow official blogs and social channels from existing ecosystem participants such as Cheesecake Labs and Soroban Domains, and everything in between. And video? Hopefully, you're an avid user of various video platforms because you'll also need to subscribe to updates from platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Adding to this complexity, navigating SDF-specific sources adds another layer of difficulty, requiring a meticulous approach to stay informed about Stellar's protocol updates and announcements through the official Stellar website, SDF blog entries, Developer Discord, and official social media channels like StellarOrg and SorobanOfficial. Additionally, tracking progress and updates for the incredibly diverse ecosystem projects presents a unique challenge. From official blogs to GitHub repositories and Twitter announcements, it is incredibly hard to see who is actively building on Stellar and where to find more information about them. Being unable to efficiently find and view this information leads to the perception of lack of innovation on the network. This fragmentation not only makes it challenging to stay informed but also creates barriers to entry for those new to Stellar. Vital events and discussions are often missed due to the lack of centralized notifications and the diverse rules of engagement across platforms.

Experience the convenience of navigating the Stellar network's dynamic landscape through one centralized web hub - Lumen Loop. Lumen Loop is designed to streamline the Stellar blockchain network's vast information ecosystem into an organized, accessible format. Lumen Loop automatically scrapes the web for the latest Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and developments. The scraper then uses AI to categorize and tag the content, as well as provide shortened, or ""TLDR"", excerpts for searchability and ease of access. For example, want to see just educational content? We’ve got you covered! Looking for protocol updates? No problem! We’ve got a category for that! Spanish content? Check! Lumen Loop also includes a project tracker where each Stellar project has a detail page with summaries, development activity, social metrics and news, making it easy for the community to follow developments. Let’s say you are a SCF reviewer or voter and you want to know if a project has been active in the ecosystem. Head to the project page, and we’ll have a breakdown on their social and dev activity! Lumen Loop’s project tracker increases project transparency and accountability. Beyond news discovery, Lumen Loop offers a centralized events calendar that details Stellar-related live events, meetups, and conferences from a variety of sources with essential information for easy community participation. Subscribe to our calendar and you won’t miss out! This ecosystem-wide calendar will keep people informed and boost engagement within the ecosystem. Finally, once Lumen Loop finds new information about projects or a new event it automatically posts summaries to various communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit and X/Twitter. This helps promote projects and grow the ecosystem - by keeping everyone in the loop.

We create scrape rules to monitor Stellar project activity on different platforms. We normalize the discovered data from an enormous list of sources into one database. We use AI to give tags and categorize. This includes a manual review process. We push discovered content to our web platform where it's easily browsed by category, tag, project, etc. and also update the events page and the individual project tracker pages if applicable. We automatically push summaries of the discovered content to different social platforms.

The basic idea of Lumen Loop is as follows: Centralized Information Hub: Aggregates Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and project developments into one platform. AI-Categorized Streams: Uses AI to organize content into searchable streams, such as educational content or developer updates, or even SCF project news. Comprehensive Event Calendar: Offers a centralized calendar detailing Stellar-related events for easy community participation. Detailed Project Tracker: Features individual pages for Stellar projects with summaries, development activity, social metrics, and a project news feed. Automated Social Media Sharing: Promotes ecosystem projects and updates by automatically posting discovered content to platforms like Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Enhances Ecosystem Transparency: Increases project transparency and accountability through detailed activity breakdowns.

The trade finance gap is $2.5T worldwide, and we are focusing on the maritime industry in SEA which represents a $500B gap with annual growth of 9.6% (https://www.adb.org/publications/2023-trade-finance-gaps-growth).

These SMEs are underserved by the traditional financial institutions, experience tight cashflows, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. These SMEs face tight cashflow problems because they have short-term needs for the money, but customers will only pay them after anywhere between 30-90 days. With invoice financing / freight factoring, these SMEs get upfront funding thus freeing them for important things such as paying their employees on time, rent, etc.

The BorderDollar platform involves two stakeholders: investors, and businesses.

Investor-facing platform: Investors refer to individuals who want to finance invoices in exchange for a certain amount of returns, i.e. between 6-11% APR. Here on the investor-facing side, investors connect their wallets, choose a liquidity pool to fund, and how much they want to fund.

Business-facing platform: SMEs which require cash will upload their invoices, and we will assess these invoices internally before putting them up for funding by funders. On this end of the platform, businesses undergo KYC. They will then receive 80-90% of their invoices' value in fiat using an off-ramp service. For example, when we onboard SMEs from the Philippines, we can use Moneygram for money transfers from the liquidity pool to fiat because of their collaboration with Circle and Stellar (https://www.moneygram.com/intl/stellarwallets).

These invoices will initially be assessed manually through SME owner interviews and due diligence, along with our risk scorecard. In the future, we will integrate machine learning for automated risk assessments for scalability.

It models a decentralized set of local community currencies with the ability to trade between currencies. Community currencies (also local currencies or LETS) are a tool for financial inclusion and for a transition to a more fair and ecologically sustainable economy. They are issued and governed by mutual credit groups, cooperatives, time banks, local councils, etc. They define the currency rules, deploy local monetary policies, and need more features than just a payments system: engaging marketplace with offers and needs, news feed, efficient means of contact between members, etc.

Blockchain technology has not penetrated this user base and most of these communities use classic centralized systems (CES, Cyclos, IntegralCES, TimeOverflow, MutualCredit). This is because individual communities lack the resources to develop a project like this, and existing cryptocurrencies don’t fit the use case because they don’t have the required features, are not flexible enough or are difficult to use or deploy. “The LETS movement, on a whole, hasn't been able to keep up with technology.” (Investopedia)

Komunitin aims to be the flagship open source project for community currencies where to join efforts into an engaging, easy to use, decentralized and secure application. After the completion of this project and thanks to Stellar, Komunitin will also provide a critical feature that all previous systems are lacking: the ability to reliably trade between different community currencies without the need of a global coordination or global asset. This feature can effectively scale heterogeneous and autonomous community currencies into a locally-governed global payments system.

Komunitin is already up and running and being used by tens of local communities across Spain, Italy and Greece for 10 years, but recently the project team is working hard in renewing the system. The user interface has already been redesigned and rebuilt and now it is time to upgrade the backend. The goal of this project is to replace the part of the old backend related with payments by a new web service using Stellar: the Komunitin accounting service.

We define a concrete set of assets, accounts and trustlines in order to model community currencies in the Stellar network. Concretely, each currency has an issuer account issuing their own asset, and an administrator account that distributes the asset. Each user within a community has its account and has the administrator account as additional signer. In order to enable trade between users of different currencies, each currency has a special external account, which acts as a proxy to foreign currencies via bidirectional sell offers. The currency administration may set trustlines with external accounts of other communities, after acknowledging that the other currency is indeed trustworthy. Then, end-users of communities can effectively trade with users from other currencies, each of them using only their local currency.

The following are the main characteristics of the Komunitin accounting service with implications on the architecture. Full representation in Stellar: Each community currency issues its own Stellar asset. Each user has its own Stellar account and all transactions are reflected in the Stellar network. Locally governed: Local currency administration has full control over their user accounts. There is no superstructure beyond local communities. Sponsored: Both base reserves and transaction fees are fully sponsored by the platform. Multi-tenant: A single Komunitin server can hold multiple community currencies. A new community currency can be created by filling a form. Data from different communities are isolated in different databases. Federated: Several Komunitin servers can coexist, each one in charge of a different set of community currencies. Users can trade with other users in the same or different Komunitin server (provided there is a trust path between their currencies). Custodial: Users and administrators don’t save their Stellar private keys. Their server is responsible for signing transactions on their behalf and users need to fully trust it. This property may be changed in the future to a non-custodial architecture.

The Komunitin accounting service is the bridge between the Komunitin app and the Stellar network. It implements a JSON REST API for communication with the Komunitin app. It features payments and all other related operations: CRUD for currencies and accounts, local (same currency) and external (different currencies) payments. It is also responsible for implementing some features not directly translatable to Stellar: payment requests, negative balances, recurring payments, collecting membership fee, sending events to users and persisting state not suitable to be stored in the Stellar ledger. Once ready, the Komunitin app will switch from using the current old backend to the new Komunitin accounting service for the payment-related operations. After that, the app and the backend will evolve together with new features. The social features (offers, needs, news, profiles, etc) will still be provided by the current backend. The Komunitin accounting service will be developed in TypeScript, using the Nitro web server toolkit, a PostgreSQL database server for data persistence via TypeORM and the JavaScript Stellar SDK for interaction with the Stellar network and the OAuth2 protocol for client authorization. The whole system will be deployed using a set of Docker containers using Github Actions. Push messages to users will be sent via the notifications service, an additional microservice written in Go, already developed and working and using the Google Cloud Messaging service.

All user’s private keys will be stored in a database column AES-encrypted using a different key per community. These community keys will be again stored in the database encrypted using a master key, provided to the server in deployment time, only in memory and not shared with other OS processes. Master and community keys will be rotated periodically. This is a simple but sufficient security approach in case of community currencies, where the first security layer is given by interpersonal trust of small communities. The fact that all transactions are recorded in Stellar makes it possible for the currency administration to check and eventually restore the balance of a compromised account. The current architecture allows for switching to a non-custodial model in the future if any community currency is ever convertible to fiat or cryptocurrency assets.

There can be multiple Komunitin servers. Each community currency completely belongs to a server, and a single server can maintain multiple currencies. The team will maintain an instance at komunitin.org, but communities are encouraged to deploy additional instances if they have the resources. The only federation feature in this iteration is the availability to perform payments with users on different servers. For same-currency payments, the user can select or search the list of members. Account names, avatars and profiles are provided by another subsystem (the Komunitin social service) that is out of the scope of this project. This is not available for external users yet, and hence the user will need to enter an account URI (either scanning a QR code or selecting the currency and account number) to identify the target account. The server will reach this URI to get the user’s public key and perform the path payment through the Stellar network.",,,https://komunitin.org,https://github.com/komunitin/komunitin/,https://studio.youtube.com/video/PM-gJJ-5MGM/edit,,,,,,,Esteve Badia,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/esteve-badia-orive/,,,
ICanProveIt -Proof-of-Learning,SCF #26,ICanProveIt -Proof-of-Learning,ICanProveIt -Proof-of-Learning,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rectVXjaidotlGe5e,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,451015.64,5/3/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"An AI exam generation platform for the creation of universally respected, academic-standard proof-of-learning certificates.","ICanProveIt is a digital certification platform that uses advanced technologies to issue verifiable, blockchain-based educational certificates. The platform combines AI, blockchain (Stellar), and decentralized identity (DID) to create proof-of-learning certificates that adhere to high pedagogical standards accepted universally by academic institutions. ICanProveIt is designed by university professors and academics to not be adversarial to the academic world. While ICanProveIt may challenge traditional educational roles it also promises to liberate teaching professionals from administrative burdens, enabling them to focus more on teaching and research. ICanProveIt was designed to be teacher/professor friendly.

This platform addresses multiple challenges:

Non-Demonstrable Knowledge: A significant issue is that 98% of our knowledge and capabilities are non-demonstrable and unshareable. ICanProveIt creates a digital, verifiable format that allows individuals to demonstrate and share their learning effectively.

Chaotic Proof-of-Learning Outside Academia: Outside of the academic world, proof-of-learning is often chaotic, pedagogically repulsive, and largely ignored. The platform standardizes the validation process with rigorous academic oversight to restore credibility.

Limited Formal Education Scope: Formal education covers less than 1% of subjects that people learn throughout their lives. ICanProveIt expands the scope by certifying a broader range of knowledge and skills, regardless of how they were acquired.

Lack of Verifiability: Traditional online learning often lacks a reliable method to verify educational achievements. ICanProveIt solves this by using blockchain technology for immutable record-keeping.

Education Accessibility: High costs and geographic barriers often limit educational opportunities. The platform provides affordable, universally accessible educational certification.

Standardization: There is a disparate recognition of educational certificates across different geographies and institutions. By adhering to globally recognized standards, ICanProveIt ensures its certificates have wide acceptance.

Mass Retraining Needs Induced by Job Markets Being Disrupted by AI: The platform also aims to assist those whose jobs have been disrupted by AI, offering a means to retrain and certify new skills in a rapidly changing job market.

The platform primarily serves self-learners, educational institutions, and employers. Self-learners benefit from obtaining verifiable credentials for informal learning, institutions can reduce administrative costs and maintain integrity in credential issuance, and employers receive reliable proof of candidates' learning.

ICanProveIt embraces continuous learners and recognizes that self-learning has real value to employers, and the employment market. The internet provides us with nearly unlimited opportunities follow our interests and passions. Learners can pick from blogs and YouTube videos or take fee courses from the world’s top universities given by the professors famous for their contributions or their teaching abilities. But there is a catch! Without a reputable certificate as proof-of-learning, the learner is unlikely to receive immediate benefits from his learning. No employer is going to hire someone on the basis of the learner claiming to have read a book or taken a free course with nothing to prove it. ICanProveIt works in 3 steps: The Learner follows their normal path to acquiring knowledge by reading books and blogs, watching videos and taking free online courses from universities. The learner uploads or provides us with links to their learning material. ICanProveIt platform creates an exam by matching the provided learning material against material in a repository curated by academics ensured to be up to date. After successfully completing the exam the learner is issued a certificate that can be put on a resume or shared on social media.

AI Integration: AI is used to generate personalized exams based on the content learned by users, ensuring that the assessment is tailored to the individual’s study material. Blockchain (Soroban): Stellar’s blockchain technology offers a decentralized, fast, and low-cost ledger to store certificate data, making the issuance and verification of certificates secure and efficient. Soroban Smart Contracts: Utilizing Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform, allows for complex operations like conditional certificate issuance and automated verification processes. This enhances the scalability and functionality of the certification process.

In contrast to the typical, rigid model, where learners are each given the same set of study material, followed by the same exam, ICanProveIt tests learners on the specific material they have consumed, including material from YouTube videos, blog posts, traditional or audiobooks etc. All exams are created on the fly from a curated repository of content matched with the learners' uploaded content. In the case of courses that mimic those found at traditional universities that have a generally recognized curriculum, the learner’s uploaded content will not be used for exam creation but instead will be used to inform the learner as to whether they have sufficiently studied enough (assuming that they studied all of the material uploaded) to be successful in the examination. Learners will still be able to take tests on such standardized classes if their material does not completely satisfy this requirement, but required areas are not covered by the uploaded materials and will draw their questions from a set of curated materials that reflect the standards required for passage of the material. Generating exams that are relevant to employers means following pedagogical standards that allow for comparability across subjects. Most online learning certificates are deemed worthless simply because there is little to no information about the test or material studied. Hiring managers are unlikely to dive deeper into the specific areas studied, the source of the information or the reputation of the certificate issuer. ICanProveIt is designed so that all exams generated are relevant to the learning goals and are formulated in a coherent and logical manner, one that clearly demonstrates the acquired knowledge of the student.

Coverage of Source Material - A metric ranging from 0 - 1 that indicates how much of the input text (material studied) is reflected in the quiz. It is calculated by mapping each question to the relevant sentences in the text and comparing the length of the mapped text to the total passage length. This method is based on the pyramid method used in summary annotations. Coverage of Curated Material - In cases where there is a typical course content, such as is the case for most principles and intermediate courses in various subjects at the world’s universities, the source material coverage metric will be replaced with the curated material coverage metric that covers the entirety of what is normally expected from a student in such a course and that is similarly given a metric ranging from 0 -1 as evidenced in the Coverage of Source Material metric. This prevents students from selectively choosing material that is narrower than what would typically be found in a standardized course. Employers or associations that wish to ensure coverage of specific topics can have standardized courses offered and learners will be notified as to what percentage of curated material is covered by their source material so that they can determine whether they wish to proceed with the standardized examination or whether they wish to read more of the recommended curated material instead.

Structure - A 1-3 metric assessing if a set of questions flows logically together, i.e. from easy to difficult, or that natural chronological order is used. For example, if the student was being examined on the formation of the universe, the questioning would start with the Big Bang and work towards the creation of our Solar System. This is similar to a measure used in conversational QG, where questions are logically linked for natural conversation (Mulla and Gharpure 2023). Redundancy - A 1 to 3 metric assessing repetition within an exam, such as identical questions being asked that do not require a differing perspective or adaptation of the student's thought processes. This has been utilized in conversational QG to prevent repetition and ensure natural conversation (Mulla and Gharpure 2023).

Ensuring a heightened level of quality regarding the entire test is crucial. However, the individually tailored questions must also meet exceptionally high standards. Questions must be rated on three metrics used to measure the fundamental aspects of a question's quality: Relevancy - A binary metric which measures whether the question is semantically relevant to the input context. Fluency - A binary metric used to assess the grammatical correctness and clarity of language in a set of questions. This metric is employed by Mazidi and Nielsen (2014) and Elkins et al. (2023), and is also used in different scales in Mulla and Gharpure (2023). Answerability - A binary metric which measures whether the question can be answered from the input context. It is not necessary to be able to find a passage from the input that is an answer to the question; it is enough if a student could reasonably answer the question from the context. For example, applying logic explained in the passage to a new situation makes the question ‘answerable’. As above, previous work by Steuer et al. (2021) and Elkins et al. (2023) uses a similar binary metric, and Mulla and Gharpure (2023) suggest similar metrics on different scales.",,,https://app.gitbook.com/o/mogysG76FhoGs2ghP2tZ/s/juIgouIea6BjwXmTGAhR/video-presentation,,https://app.gitbook.com/o/mogysG76FhoGs2ghP2tZ/s/juIgouIea6BjwXmTGAhR/video-presentation,,,,,,,"Tim Northrop O'brien, Tim  O'Brien",,,,,

But what do we mean? Whilst most digital wallets focus on solving one of two core pain points: payments and remittances, at Peer we believe that, whilst those are crucial problems that customers face on a day-to-day basis which we've also significantly optimized for, wallets should be so much more than a way to pay and get paid and at Peer we've built and continue to build an ecosystem of services within our app that align with one of the Stellar ecosystem's core missions: real-world use-cases. Let me break it down:

✅: for boring standard features
💜: for our differentiators that you can only find on Peer or that are unique

As of today, users on our app can:

Send & Receive any trusted asset on the Stellar network. ✅

Swap any asset on the Stellar network via our Integrated DEX built using Path Payments & Stellar Offers as part of the Stellar Core Protocol. As part of our commitment to the Soroban ecosystem we're now working on a Soroban-based version of our in-app AMM and a savings and investment feature which should be live on Stellar in Q1 2024. ✅

USDC Swap: Stellar CCTP Bridge,SCF #26,USDC Swap: Stellar CCTP Bridge,USDC Swap: Stellar CCTP Bridge,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recqE4Pq1SlYXqzuC,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,456119.48,5/7/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"USDC Swap: Seamlessly bridges USDC across networks with CCTP, prioritizing Stellar integration for efficient, low-fee transactions","USDC Swap is a cutting-edge platform designed to facilitate the swift and cost-effective swapping of the USDC stablecoin across various blockchain networks. By leveraging the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), our product prioritizes ease of use, security, and efficiency.

USDC Swap addresses the challenge of fragmented liquidity and the high cost of cross-chain transfers in the cryptocurrency market. It serves an audience ranging from individual crypto users to larger financial entities, solving these issues by providing a unified platform for swapping USDC across multiple chains, enhancing liquidity; significantly reducing transaction fees, making cross-chain transfers more accessible; and streamlining the swapping process to make it user-friendly, even for those new to cryptocurrency.

The core of USDC Swap’s functionality lies in its smart contract architecture, which underpins the CCTP integration. Here's how the process works: Users initiate a swap of USDC from one blockchain to another (e.g., from Ethereum to Stellar) via our easy-to-use interface. Upon Stellar’s integration into CCTP, USDC Swap will utilize this protocol to efficiently bridge USDC between Stellar and other networks. Until Stellar is fully integrated into CCTP, we will implement an alternative bridging method. This interim solution will facilitate USDC transfers between Stellar and ERC-20 networks, ensuring service continuity. This is the same method we used in our previous production release of USDC Swap, which saw hundreds of thousands in transaction volume with no major issues. Ultimately, our platform intends to leverage Stellar’s low-cost, high-speed transaction capabilities. Furthermore, with the advent of Soroban — Stellar's smart contract platform — we plan to enhance our services, utilizing Soroban’s advanced features for smart contracts to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable swaps.

USDC Swap will act as a fast and reliable bridge for Stellar, significantly improving its interoperability with other blockchain networks. By becoming one of the few multi-chain bridges that prioritize Stellar, we aim to position Stellar as a more accessible and versatile player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By facilitating the movement of USDC into and out of the Stellar network, USDC Swap will help in enhancing the liquidity available on Stellar. This increased liquidity is crucial for the growth and stability of Stellar’s financial ecosystem, attracting more users and use cases. The integration of USDC Swap will attract users from other chains to Stellar, showcasing its capabilities and advantages. It will make Stellar a more attractive option for various crypto activities, including trading, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, expanding its user base and utility.

These enhancements to the Stellar network, powered by USDC Swap, are aimed at unlocking new opportunities for growth, user engagement, and innovation within the Stellar ecosystem.",,,https://usdc-swap-staging.ultrastellar.com/cctp/landing/,N/A,https://youtu.be/ptq_bTIFl6E,,,,,,,"Dima, Gleb Pitsevich, Alex James",,,https://usdc-swap-staging.ultrastellar.com/cctp/landing/#,https://usdc-swap-staging.ultrastellar.com/cctp/landing/#,

The goal is to bridge the gap for Web2 users and developers who are new to the Web3 space. With Accelar, you are capable of creating dApp features, managing blockchain wallets, deploying smart contracts, and Web2 containers like LLM instances, allowing you to unify and accelerate your development process and software automations with an in-platform IDE that compiles and deploys Soroban smart contracts (Rust).

First feature: Custodial wallet management.

What problems it solves, how it solves them, and what audience it solves them for: By allowing users to deploy Web3 components with a custodial wallet, you can aggregate all your product development steps in one place. Non-Web3 users now have a simple and efficient way to start learning how to work with blockchain capabilities; companies and startups can have their developers working in the same environment without the need to share private information that could compromise production environments.

How it works and how it uses Stellar and/or Soroban: Similar to how it currently works with the Accelar ICP wallet creation and management for interactions with the Soroban protocol and the creation of identities, we use node-pty to programmatically execute calls in the terminal, handing it over to the soroban-cli.

Second feature: IDE.

What problems it solves, how it solves them, and what audience it solves them for: By having an IDE capable of compiling and deploying Soroban code, the platform facilitates the onboarding of new Web3 users to the network. The main difference is that no other Soroban IDE currently has the capability of deploying the smart contract coded on the platform with the option of using either a custodial wallet (created by the Accelar platform under the management of the user) or the user's own Web3 wallet. The contracts deployed by the IDE will be automatically added under the data management section of the user, where the user can have an overview analysis of its smart contracts running (similar to how it works today with Accelar <> ICP). The main targets are companies that need to have a standardized operating system and that allows the management of multiple members per workspace. With a low-code environment, we are also able to reach Web2 developers who are willing to transition into the Web3 world.

How it works and how it uses Stellar and/or Soroban: The development of smart contracts with our code editor will be facilitated by the Monaco Editor (by Microsoft). It integrates with our Next.js frontend and Nest.js backend to save compiled code and eventually deploy it.

Accelar is built on top of a variety of frameworks to enable all its functionalities. For features involving the deployment of LLM containers, we utilize AWS and open-source models from Hugging Face. For automation processes and interconnections, we intend to build on top of our monolith in NestJS, which is already operational. To allow instant messaging and notifications between users and services (user <> backend), we implement WebSocket (socket.io) workflows. The backend is built with Nest.js (main backend) and FastAPI (for LLM apps), while the frontend is developed with Next.js. The development of smart contracts with our code editor will be facilitated by the Monaco Editor (by Microsoft).

The following features are already available on the platform:

Creation of custodial ICP identities
Deployment of canisters (two templates: hello world and POC vector database)
Deployment of wallet canisters
UI canister integration to interact with the deployed canisters
Create transfer transactions with wallet canisters
Workspace members' management
Workspace chat feature
Workspace Kanban feature
Deployment of LLM instances (two templates from Hugging Face: NLP and Falcon 7B)
Interaction with LLM instances (question/answer workflow)
Creation of automated workflows within a workspace

Monetization: The Accelar platform will monetize in two ways: fees from transactions and monthly subscriptions. For every major transaction, such as CPU deployments through Akash, a fee will be charged. Additionally, certain features will only be available to users through a monthly subscription, which is a feature planned for the future.",,,www.accelar.io,https://github.com/Accelar-labs,https://youtu.be/KJDSlkWEnbE,,,,,,,BRUNO LAUREANO DOS SANTOS,,,https://twitter.com/accelarlabs,,

It's a new platform built on Stellar that uses Soroban smart contracts to make moving digital assets between different blockchains easier. Think of it as a bridge connecting various blockchains, allowing users to send and receive tokens effortlessly. This ultimately brings more resources (liquidity) into the Stellar ecosystem.

Who is MUWP for?

New Users: MUWP makes complex cross-chain transactions simple, letting beginners participate in DeFi (decentralized finance) without needing deep blockchain knowledge.

Experienced Users: MUWP offers advanced users improved security and efficiency. They can create custom trading paths and benefit from faster transactions.

Everyone: MUWP simplifies cross-chain transactions for all users. It's user-friendly but still leverages the power of Soroban's smart contracts.

Benefits of MUWP:

Easy to Use: No more complicated DeFi processes! MUWP makes it easy for anyone to move tokens between blockchains.

Safe and Efficient: MUWP uses Soroban's smart contracts for secure and fast transactions.

Liquidity Boost: As users and assets flow into Stellar for DeFi activities, overall liquidity in the ecosystem increases, benefiting all market participants.

DeFi Expansion: Introducing sophisticated DeFi operations on Stellar through MUWP and Soroban attracts a broader user base and developers interested in building DeFi applications.

More Decentralization: MUWP reduces reliance on centralized exchanges, making the overall financial system more independent.

How Does MUWP Work with Soroban? MUWP integrates with Stellar and leverages Soroban's smart contracts to improve DeFi on Stellar. Here's how it works for sending a single token from another blockchain (Blockchain X) to Stellar:

User Starts Transfer: You want to send Token A from Blockchain X to Stellar.

Deposit to Bridge: You deposit Token A into a special contract on Blockchain X. This contract confirms your deposit and starts the transfer process.

Validation and Locking: The contract checks the transaction and locks your tokens, ensuring they can't be used on Blockchain X anymore.

Issuing on Stellar: A matching amount of Token A (or a wrapped version) is created on Stellar by MUWP's Soroban smart contract. This might involve verifying the transfer through special programs called ""oracles.""

Tokens Arrive on Stellar: You receive the created tokens in your Stellar wallet, ready to be used within the Stellar ecosystem.

For now, MUWP focuses on single-token transfers. Multi-token swaps will be added later in our roadmap.

Existing Work: It's important to highlight that our team has already developed an MVP with a single-token feature and multi-token feature operational within EVM-compatible ecosystems. This existing framework establishes a solid foundation for our forthcoming development on Stellar. Upon release, we plan to leverage this pre-existing infrastructure to streamline liquidity transfer on Stellar. Initially, this will facilitate single-token transactions, with an expansion to multi-token transfers to follow (see roadmap below).

We invite you to experience our MVP firsthand at https://muwp.xyz/. Please note that the current design is tailored for functionality, primarily to enhance usability for our non-developer beta testers.",,,https://www.muwpay.com/,https://github.com/Muwpay-uniswapper/Muwp-Stellar/tree/main,https://youtu.be/3J7QXVyJXu4,,,,,,,"Gaël BOKONGO, Xavier Gomez, Abongi-Gael Bokongo",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/muwpay/,https://twitter.com/muwpay,https://discord.gg/wmZUxJtuad,

Bingtellar has been live since 2023, serving customers in 5 African markets (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda) with plans to expand to more regions by Q3 2024. We currently have 5,000 customers and 150 businesses onboarded, growing at 45% MoM, and more than 15 signed Letters of Intent from businesses looking to accept and make payments leveraging our on/off-ramp infrastructure.

Bingtellar’s vision is to bridge the gap between Web3 payments and the traditional financial system, making cryptocurrency spending and utility as easy and seamless as any other currency, providing an ecosystem shaped around users' everyday needs. With a web2 approach, our aim is to provide users a seamless experience in both traditional and digital financial services, with an emphasis on accessibility and security.

Why Is Bingtellar Needed?

Remittances serve as a crucial lifeline for 40% of the population in Africa. With rising globalization, there is a growing need for better ways to connect with the global economy, seamless cross-border transactions, and financial operations, which presents a $103bn market opportunity. This market is not yet served by incumbents like Wise, PayPal, and Western Union due to limitations in the underlying infrastructure and a lack of inclination to serve the African market.

Nearly 66% of Africans are either still unbanked or lack access to formal financial services and global payments. For remote workers, migrants, and cross-border traders, this is particularly challenging because they have no safe or reliable way to bring their money across borders or an affordable way to send and receive money, leaving them vulnerable to exploitative exchange rates and theft. Intra-Africa remittance corridors are the most expensive in the world, costing users up to 25% in fees and foreign exchange rates. Nevertheless, informal channels (like P2P and FX brokers) still process a huge chunk of transactions in sub-Saharan Africa because they figured out how to stay connected to local users. In the African market, customer convenience, better experience, and flexibility trump all other characteristics of remittance services.

This is where Bingtellar comes in. Our cross-border and payment product is not confined by state boundaries. With the platform, Bingtellar users can send money using both fiat and cryptocurrencies, swap multiple currencies, enjoy fast transfers, pay for goods and services, and more.

How it works:

Bingtellar is akin to a Wise for Africa, but with stablecoins and better, tailored to both crypto and non-crypto native users. Most blockchain-based products have targeted the crypto community, but we have taken a different approach and will target the everyday user by abstracting the complexities involved with blockchain transactions and crypto wallets. The beauty of Bingtellar’s design is that it does not impact the customer experience. No understanding of complex technical systems is required for non-crypto users. Users transact using local currencies they already know and trust (currently NGN, RWF, KES, GHS, and UGX) or crypto for crypto-friendly users. We have given users the flexibility to pick their preferred currency and process transactions. This currency will be used to send, request, and receive payments. All payments between users, no matter the currency, will auto-convert. No need to think about currencies or trustlines ever again. Payments are affordable, and we will even sponsor the network fees through feebumps.

We use Stellar’s Blockchain under-the-hood to facilitate all transactions and improve Bingtellar’s security and efficiency without complicating the user experience.

Problem Bingtellar solves:

Cross-border payments: Traditional fiat rails for cross-border payments can be slow (takes 4-7 working days), expensive (about 10-15% fees to receive payments), and complex (might need 2-3 apps + lots of intermediaries before final settlement to the bank). Unfortunately, platforms like PayPal and Wise, which could address these issues, are not tailored to the African market.

Crypto for everyday payments: One of the biggest blockers to why people cannot use or access crypto and utilize it for daily payments is because of platform user experience. A lot of platforms that support crypto do not have the best user experience, either too many steps and processes or just generally overly complex user interfaces. At Bingtellar, the crypto payments experience can be optimized to solve the crucial problems that customers face on a day-to-day basis, and we've built and continue to build an ecosystem of services within our platform that align with one of the Stellar ecosystem's core missions: real-world use-cases.

Crypto utility: With crypto adoption quickly rising in Africa, stables have become a great way for people to hedge against inflation and devaluation of local currency. However, most crypto platforms are built mostly as trading-only and crypto exchange platforms, which is extremely complex for non-crypto users that just want to access basic services, and this difficulty hinders adoption. In order to onboard the next billions of users into crypto or make holding digital assets as common as cash or using a debit card for payment, we need to optimize for one thing: ""utility,"" and we are building with this in mind.

Cross-border trade: Selling products and collecting payments today from users in different African markets is very difficult for businesses due to the fragmented nature of payment systems across the continent. By streamlining payment processes, we empower businesses to boost their revenues and scale their operations without the complexities and anxieties traditionally associated with cross-border payments in Africa.

How Bingtellar solves these:

Bingtellar aspires to create an experience that merges the effortless user experience of Wise/Venmo with truly borderless accessibility made possible by the Stellar network's unique ecosystem. Our approach not only contributes to strengthening the Stellar ecosystem but also serves as a vehicle for financial inclusion and economic stability, offering communities a valuable tool to grow and participate in the global economy more securely and efficiently.

Through a series of external integrations with licensed partners, in addition to our continent-wide agents (P2P network) and institutional OTC infrastructure that acts as rails, Bingtellar is able to facilitate the movement of fiat and expand into new markets without a physical presence or its own licenses. Our core on and off-ramping experiences are fully native, never requiring a user to go through hurdles.

Bingtellar & Stellar:

How Does Bingtellar Use Stellar?

Using Stellar helps Bingtellar reduce transaction costs, improve security, facilitate instantaneous transactions, and enhance transparency as a back-end system. Stellar is currently not a customer-facing technology; Stellar is the engine behind all transactions. Being built on Stellar enables us to access the blockchain’s benefits and also pass on the benefits of a blockchain-based system (including speed, transparency, and reduced costs) to customers without exposing them to volatility or a complex user experience. We create individual Stellar wallets for each user, and all transactions occur on-chain. That said, we do not hide the presence of blockchain from customers. As Bingtellar expands its network and to other anchors, additional currencies can be added to the front-end.

We are utilizing Soroban for Transaction Monitoring and for verified audit trails, ensuring data integrity and creating an on-chain audit trail. Soroban enables us to verify transactions, substantiate liquidity claims in peer-to-peer engagements, and facilitate service discovery. By leveraging Soroban, we strengthen security measures, mitigate risks, and uphold regulatory compliance standards. Additionally, Soroban's Account Specific Token Allowances feature empowers us to manage token allowances efficiently, enhancing user experience and operational effectiveness. Overall, Soroban plays a pivotal role in enhancing the reliability, transparency, and efficiency of our solution on the Stellar blockchain.

Why Is Bingtellar Valuable to Stellar?

Bingtellar aligns with Stellar’s mission: we focus on financial inclusion in emerging markets. We strive to make our services available and accessible, especially for the world’s most financially marginalized. Bingtellar offers inexpensive services to the financially excluded. We’ve already seen users in LATAM corridors use Bingtellar to remit money back home to their friends and families in Africa, which is very exciting.

Many companies promote using blockchain to benefit the underserved and unbanked, but few have been able to bring that idea to fruition. Our focus has been to build a product that feels like a regular web2 payment solution but uses blockchain behind the scenes. To do this, we have chosen to let users pick a preferred currency. This currency will be used to send, request, and receive payments.

From a technical perspective, Bingtellar is valuable to Stellar. As we grow, Bingtellar is planning to bring thousands of transactions to the network each month and expand Stellar into countries it has not been able to reach yet. As we move forward, we will become interoperable with other anchors in order to facilitate a truly global network of payments and currencies. Our customers are inherently mobile and moving across borders, so our vision is to support them — by using Stellar — anywhere they go.

Benefits:

Scalable Distribution:

With strategic alliances with commerce, SMEs, diaspora communities, and partnerships with financial institutions through OTC desks, we unlock a world of possibilities. These partnerships not only amplify our credibility but also extend our reach, granting broader access to Stellar USDC and XLM within a vast customer base.

Target Market:

Our initial target market will be Africa (to plug Stellar to Africa local payment rails and underserved communities), but we are aiming to roll out globally. In these countries, many people encounter one or more of these problems. Also, these countries have good Stellar anchor coverage. But by design, Bingtellar is a global product, which means the sender can send from anywhere in the world. A business owner or someone in, for example, Argentina can use Bingtellar to send remittances in USDC or XLM to their business partners, friends, or family in Kenya, and recipients would get Kenyan shillings in their Mpesa wallet at zero fee with near-instant settlement.

By targeting Sub-Saharan Africa, we bring a lot of new exposure to the Stellar Blockchain and the community. This, we believe, will bring in new users not only to Bingtellar but also to the Stellar network at large. Stellar's integration with Moneygram is a great step in making cash on/off-ramp more usable for remittance. However, there's an additional possibility to improve usability by on/off-ramping directly into the recipient's mobile money wallet, which is what we're building for this project.

Through Bingtellar, we bring real-world use-cases to the Stellar blockchain, allowing everyday users to use the Stellar blockchain for their everyday payments and transactions. This will further aid in creating a truly inclusive financial ecosystem that aligns with Stellar's mission to create equitable access to the global financial system.

Here is our Pitch showcase at the Africa Tech Summit 2024 in Nairobi: https://youtu.be/nwB46FSmK9I?si=NeT7503-sBio6Rgd.

Alterscope,SCF #26,KYP - Risk Dashboard (Phase 2),Alterscope,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec9bGg7CKnZUW3tG,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$99200.00,$99200.00,937312.50,5/16/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"We provide a Soroban ecosystem dashboard, enabling the community and LPs to perform DDs on protocols and create risk frameworks.","Alterscope aims to craft a real-time risk overview within Soroban's growing ecosystem, highlighting dApp-specific risks. We follow the thesis that liquidity is directed to trustworthy protocols with the best risk-return ratio. For that reason, we provide retail investors and professional liquidity providers a risk-adjusted view of protocols, and enable them to monitor risks in real-time. We offer publicly accessible risk dashboard that anybody can perform their own research, and onboard protocols and liquidity pools front facing relevant liquidity providers in our institutional setup. We propose to build a community dashboard for Soroban with the major DeFi applications included to facilitate end users to research dApps and to perform due diligence on on-chain/off-chain related parameters, ranging from liquidity to security metrics. Thereby, we provide a clear look at dApps in the Soroban ecosystem, helping improve projects and attract and retain liquidity in the ecosystem. “Know Your Protocol"" (KYP) is a concept we have developed to emphasize the importance of understanding the intricacies of dApps. Drawing inspiration from the financial sector's ""Know Your Customer"" principle, KYP allows a comprehensive research of protocols. The Stellar ""Know Your Protocol"" dashboard links to a DYOR community dashboard to assess dApp-specific risks metrics.

Benefits for Soroban ecosystem: Enable the community to do their own research: DYOR (“Do Your Own Research”) does not work. Neither the community nor professional LPs can sufficiently research risks of protocols. Alterscope changes that by facilitating anybody to perform sound and comparable research across chains, protocols and liquidity pools. Overcome obstacles for large LPs to invest: 53% of crypto hedge funds and 43% of traditional hedge funds are already involved with liquidity provision strategies. Top obstacles for professional players to invest remain a lack of understanding of protocol fundamentals, security concerns, and perceived complexity. Show regulatory compliance: Our KYP (Know Your Protocol) dashboards underscore the value of transparency, demonstrating a commitment to regulatory compliance and fostering a healthy DeFi ecosystem.

Benefits for dApps to become integrated on our platform: Bolster credibility: Show your commitment to risk management and transparency by and linking to your Alterscope risk dashboard. Accelerate your business development: By referring to a neutral third-party that provides metrics around security, liquidity, governance, and socials, the speed of decision making is increased among liquidity providers and investors. Make the right metrics available to investors: Alterscope has built up its solution in partnership with institutions and hedge funds. By showing the right metrics, large LPs are enabled to make investment decisions.

After completing Phase 1 (Activation Award), we have established the foundations for indexing and integrating protocols in the Soroban ecosystem in our KYP dashboards, enabling the community to perform sound due diligences on ecosystem elements. This application is dedicated to Phase 2 of integrating Soroban-based dApps in the Alterscope platform.

Product Frontend Alterscope has developed frontend frameworks that take into account the needs of LPs and investors when analyzing dApps encompassing metrics around security, liquidity, and governance. Our dashboards are continuously updated and further developed to become more and more comprehensive and powerful. We are working on various major risk categories to analyze risks and facilitate users' analysis of risks, which we currently break down in the following overarching dimensions: Security, Liquidity, Community, Governance & Tokenomics. The first section starts by collecting general information about the protocol, such as protocol type, and links to the website, code repository and documentation. Also, we apply an initial assessment based on our own standardized methodology (see here for more information about the Alterscope risk scoring methodology).

Security The Security Section provides information on general security-related parameters, such as information on the founder team, bug bounty amounts, code upgradability (i.e., proxy contracts), past hacks, etc. We deploy a static smart contract analyzer to check for adherence of coding best practices. Additionally, we provide comprehensive development statistics, such as the number of issues raised and pull requests submitted, and analyze the skewness in the distribution of developer contributions. The security section gives additionally anybody the ability to easily evaluate protocols’ audits by aggregating and clustered relevant information around the auditor and, the auditing firm and the audit itself.

Liquidity The Liquidity Analysis section is an essential part of our assessment for DeFi projects. Our approach to analyzing liquidity is carefully tailored to fit the specific type of DeFi protocol we're evaluating, such as DEXs, lending platforms, and others. This allows us to focus on the unique characteristics of each protocol's liquidity system. In our liquidity analysis for DeFi projects, we evaluate several key parameters to gain a comprehensive understanding of the liquidity dynamics. Our analysis starts at the overall protocol level by looking at general parameters, such as at TVL, which gives us a broad view of the financial health of the protocol. We then zoom in on individual liquidity pools, examining their design, activity, and changes in liquidity over time. For example, we monitor daily transaction activity by tracking the average number of transactions and the total transaction volume. This measurement helps us gauge the daily operational activity of the protocol. Next, we assess volume continuity by analyzing the average and median trading volumes, along with the number of unique wallet interactions and the total transaction count. These metrics allow us to evaluate how consistently users are trading and the overall user engagement with the protocol. We also focus on liquidity health, where we score all wallets associated with the protocol based on their financial stability. Our analysis extends to pool-specific insights where we delve into each liquidity pool to review critical aspects such as the liquidity pools’ total value locked, fees generated, transaction count, and the diversity of wallet interactions. We also analyze the volume and value of the tokens within each pool. These comprehensive evaluations provide a detailed view of not only the numerical data but also the practical functionality and stability of liquidity in DeFi projects, ensuring our analysis is both informed and grounded.

Community The community surrounding a protocol and the sentiment towards it can significantly impact the liquidity metrics of a dApp. In the Community Section, we offer a comprehensive view of the community and the social channels they use. For example, we provide statistics on subreddit popularity, Discord server activity, the number of moderators, and the communication patterns, including the intensity of daily interactions. We aggregate these parameters to calculate a sentiment index. Additionally, we offer clear insights through a clustering of recent topics discussed within the community. This enables anyone to quickly identify the most recent and prevalent topics related to the protocol, enhancing understanding of the community's current interests and concerns.

Governance & Tokenomics This section outlines the governance structure of a protocol and, where available, provides insights into the associated project token. Our format simplifies the understanding of key governance aspects such as the voting schema, the number of voters, and details relating to the spread of proposals, as well as metrics on voter engagement with each proposal. Our activity dashboards are designed to clarify the process of evaluating voter ratings and tracking monthly proposals, which are crucial for assessing voting power distribution and its relationship to community requests. If a token has been issued, we offer additional information on the tokenomics of the project, including price dynamics, lock-up periods, and the impact of major holders. We also analyze the Gini coefficient to understand the distribution among token holders. Included in our analysis are key circulation metrics such as the 24-hour trading volume, token velocity, the total number of holders, and the concentration of the top five holders, providing a comprehensive view of the token’s market dynamics.

Comparison Tool Based on the datasets of integrated protocols, we provide advanced features and tooling. For example, integrated protocols are included in our research tool that enables anybody to easily select metrics of the Alterscope platform and put them on a graph to analyze developments over time and across different protocols. With few clicks, anyone can build production-ready dashboards, analyzing off- and on-chain data, into the same visualization layer, greatly facilitating research in the web3 space.

Product Backend Data acquisition and processing: Our high-level design system streamlines a multi-faceted public data ingestion process, differentiated in on- and off-chain data sources. Regarding, on-chain data we run our own nodes and build proprietary ETL pipeline to ensure a high accuracy and latency of data (e.g., Liquidity Risk Data). Regarding off-chain data, we built our own data pipeline infrastructure for being able to continuously gather and process relevant data (e.g., Development Activity Data from GitHub). To ensure data integrity, we run stress tests on our infrastructure and establish quality processes. Architecture: The system architecture is designed to enable efficient data processing, ingestion, and management, integrating machine and deep learning capabilities with high speed data storage. The data processing utilizes Kafka for stream processing, coupled with a ML engine for risk processing, and employs an ETL process for data treatment. The system incorporates APIs to harness off-chain data from various sources, including GitHub and social media, and utilizes web crawlers for real-time data acquisition. Storage solutions are diversified, featuring for example MongoDB for structured risk parameters, ensuring robust data persistence and retrieval. The AWS is orchestrated via Kubernetes, utilizing EBS for scaling. The frontend is made with React.js libraries to render the data in an intuitive dashboard, interfacing with the OAuth2 service for secure user authentication.",,,https://www.alterscope.org/,,https://docsend.com/view/8xq93htps4wnpg43 ,,,,,,,"Benedikt Eikmanns, Halil Eralp Kocas, Vedran Zivicnjak, Can, Marijo Radman",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/Alterscope,https://twitter.com/Alterscope,https://discord.com/invite/QpVxf742qx,

CyVers,SCF #26,CyVers - Web3 Proactive Protec,CyVers,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec06I0eNKQ4gWeOq,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$49996.00,$49996.00,446077.81,4/19/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Cyvers is a ML &amp; AI based security solution that proactively mitigates and prevents asset-loss related exploits in real-time.,"The problem

In 2023 alone, $1.7B was lost due to smart contract exploits and access control violations. Alarmingly, more than 90% of the exploited contracts had been audited. This trend continues in 2024, with large-scale losses. In many cases, these exploits are happening even when organizations are leveraging 3rd party custodians and/or MPC or multi-sig wallets. In short, while security audits and traditional security measures are important, it is clear they must not be the only line of defense when it comes to on-chain asset security. The solution to these issues lives in real-time threat detection and response.

The solution

Cyvers is a proactive security platform that provides real-time detection and automated mitigation against exploits. The platform is built on top of proprietary machine learning and AI models to predict, alert, and mitigate asset loss-related risks with an accuracy of 95%. In practice, Cyvers consumes all activity broadcasted to the network in real-time through Cyvers' operated nodes and/or data providers. This allows our platform to monitor, classify, and risk score each interaction and to detect any malicious or illicit activity in real-time - in many cases, before. Our models have been trained on thousands of confirmed attacks across leading to our impressive detection rate and an industry-leading false positive rate. Within the platform, there are 3 products, all of which use the same underlying technology and provide value to different groups across the Stellar/Soroban network. Each tool can be accessed through API and UI and can be integrated during development or post-deployment.

VigiLens - Native cross-chain threat intelligence platform to identify security vulnerabilities across entire networks.

Product - Cross-chain threat intelligence platform designed to provide a robust, real-time data feed of all security-related malicious and illicit activity detected across Stellar and Soroban.

How - VigiLens consumes all on-chain activity in real-time and feeds this data through proprietary machine learning and AI models to provide predictive alerts to mitigate security vulnerabilities. Accessible via API or UI, users can filter for different threat criteria to ensure they’re only notified and actioning alerts that are relevant to them. In addition, you can create custom workflows and triggers to ensure that any required response is automated and initiated immediately and appropriately.

Audience - This tool has a very broad use case. The Stellar Foundation could leverage this data feed to better understand illicit network activity, exploit trends, and use it as a source of potential areas of improvement for future upgrades on both Stellar and Soroban. Traders, hedge funds, and lending protocols could leverage VigiLens as a data source to inform positions and risk exposure. Insurance companies can use it to de-risk clients building in or holding assets on Stellar/Soroban, affecting the availability and cost of insurance for ecosystem players. Given Stellar’s interest in use cases like CBDCs, cross-border payments, and tokenization of RWA, public sector agencies could use VigiLens to ensure financial compliance and public asset safety. These are a few of many other use cases.

Address Shield - Real-time security monitoring and incident response for wallet addresses and smart contracts.

Product - Customizable address-level monitoring and automated rules for response. Add addresses of interest through UI or API and protect against smart contract and application layer risks including but not limited to malicious contract deployment, smart contract exploits, oracle manipulation, MEV/Front-running attacks, phishing scams, private key and access control leakage exploits.

How - The implementation and “kill chain” regarding how the response mechanism would mitigate the risks is dependent on the use case. AddressShield can act as a first line of defense, alerting and triggering automated responses like contract pause functions, blocking transactions and triggering workflows. With VigiLens you can build bespoke responses for each threat type (17 in total) on individual addresses or create blanket rules. This can be implemented directly through the UI or API.

Audience - The tool integrates with both decentralized/non-custodial and centralized/custodial use cases. In DeFi, it can protect smart contracts against vulnerabilities and exploits. By detecting malicious contract deployments, alerting teams of manipulation attempts, and pausing contracts Cyvers is able to prevent and mitigate asset loss. In contrast, in CeFi it can detect and mitigate access control and private key leakage-related exploits. On other networks that VigiLens supports currently, we have lending protocols, DEXs, CEXs, insurance companies, regulators, analytics firms, hedge funds and layer 2’s using the system to protect themselves against these threats.

Reputation Risk Scoring Engine - Cross-chain address and smart contract risk exposure scoring.

Product - Reputation Risk Scoring provides a complete, cross-chain view of an address or contract’s exposure to security and sanctions-related risks. It automatically scans for exposure to scams, smart contract exploits, sanctions lists, illicit funding sources and more.

How - Leveraging the VigiLens data set and models, the Reputation Risk Scoring Engine scans the input address and calculates an overview risk score and includes a breakdown by risk type and exposure. Please see the attached deck for further context.

Audience - Any organization that is looking to ensure they are not facilitating or handling digital assets that may have exposure to illicit activity can use this tool. Many criminals are leveraging cross-chain swaps and bridges as a new way to launder and obfuscate funds and existing compliance tools are not proficient in tracing risk through these types of transactions. As such, regulated organizations that are using existing compliance tools for transaction monitoring may facilitate the trade or on/off ramp of these assets without knowledge that they carry exposure to illicit activity. Reputation Risk Scoring can be used by CEXs, DEXs, law enforcement, banks, regulators, on/off ramp providers, and more.

In short, Cyvers can provide the entire Stellar / Soroban ecosystem with value. From the Foundation itself, to builders and down to the individual users whose assets can be protected, Cyvers can be an additional pillar of security and trust in the Stellar ecosystem. Given the significant leadership role in developing the web3 ecosystem Stellar plays, we believe that Cyvers can help further demonstrate Stellar and Soroban’s commitment to user security and safety.",,,www.cyvers.ai,,https://app.arcade.software/share/wPz1mfj382DmdsGv74w4,,,,,,,"David Lavid, Assaf Buchner",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyvers/,https://twitter.com/cyvers_,,
Reflector,SCF #26,Reflector | CEX price feeds,Reflector,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec6KwJXq7HNQpjAb,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$100000.00,$100000.00,944871.47,5/15/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"Decentralized price feed oracle for Stellar DeFi smart contracts to support derivatives, lending/borrowing, asset management","Reflector oracle contracts are controlled by the multisig-protected consensus of reputable organizations. The admin account of the oracle smart contract always has all node public keys as co-signers with >50% multisig threshold, so more than half of the oracle backing nodes have to agree on a transaction in order to store price feed data or modify oracle contract state.

Each node independently calculates the values of quoted prices using deterministic idempotent algorithms to ensure consistency, generates the update transaction, signs it with the node's private key, and shares it with other peer nodes via WebSocket protocol. If for some reason (ledger access delay, failing connection, version incompatibility, adversary attack) any given node quotes a token/asset price different from other nodes, the transaction hash will not match the hash generated by the majority, so the transaction won't make it into the ledger. This way Reflector utilizes Stellar protocol underlying security to implement an uncomplicated yet robust consensus, which guarantees reliability, fault tolerance, and regular price feed updates.

For on-chain Stellar assets price feed data retrieval, Reflector relies on a quorum of nodes connected to Stellar validators. Each node fetches trades information directly from the Stellar Core database. Price feeds for generic tokens get updated in a similar fashion, but nodes have to agree on information pulled from external sources (CEX/DEX API, price aggregators, stock exchanges, derivative platforms, etc.)

Other contracts interact with the oracle contract, retrieving data stored by Reflector nodes. Consumers can fetch historical ranges, use cross-price calculation, utilize TWAP averaging, or simply pull the most recent token price depending on the use-case.

Components

Reflector node: Fetches prices, maintains p2p communication with other nodes, and publishes price updates signed by the quorum.

Put simply, developing smart contracts is hard.

Specifically:

While Rust (the most well supported Soroban SDK) is one of the most admired languages, it is far from one of the most popular.

More mature and seasoned smart contract platforms are complicated and error prone.

Thus, how can we help existing developers succeed? Even more importantly, how can we lower the barrier to entry for community newcomers? And as a stretch, how easy can we make it for non-technical folks to participate and even create their own smart contracts?

With the above problem in mind, consider the following:

65% of the general population are visual learners.

Scratch is an incredible first language, in fact it’s also more popular than Rust.

Digicus is a block-based Soroban smart contract programming language complete with an easy to use, low-code IDE. It attempts to leverage the existing programming on-boarding paradigms to give folks an opportunity to get their hands dirty while also requiring only the minimal amount of technical expertise to get started; we want Stellar developers to be writing contracts without requiring them to understand Rust, investigate WASM binaries, etc. Many schools use Scratch as their coding 101 class for exactly this reason!

Once folks become familiar with smart contracts via Digicus, there are two paths forward:

Transition to using the SDF supported Rust SDK (Digicus can target the Rust SDK so this transition can initially be a hybrid). This is akin to CS-201 where folks begin to use languages like Python and Java to learn data structures and algorithms.

Adopt Digicus as the IDE and programming language of choice for Soroban smart contract development. In this case, we will work to adopt and integrate into the IDE other community initiatives, projects, and efforts such as vulnerability analysis frameworks, auto-complete tooling, etc.

There are a few audiences we target:

[primary] net new members to the Soroban developer community

[primary] existing, less technically savvy members of the Soroban developer community

[secondary] existing, technically savvy members of the Stellar developer community who have only just started experimenting with Soroban

While we might see Soroban power users adopt our tooling, we are not (at least initially) developing with this community in mind.

It aims to make the auditing process faster, more affordable, and continuous, thereby enhancing the security of smart contracts by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by hackers.

Problems Solved:
Due to their immutability, smart contracts need to go through security audits before being deployed on mainnet to ensure there aren’t bugs or vulnerabilities in the code. Traditional security audits have incredibly high costs (even up to $200k+) and lengthy processes (top auditors have long waitlists) associated with them, making them inaccessible for many projects. Inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of manual audits, which often fail to prevent breaches even when conducted.

How It Solves Them:
Utilizes large language models (LLMs) and other AI algorithms trained on a vast repository of smart contract audits and known vulnerabilities to automate the audit process. Delivers audit outcomes within seconds, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional audits. Offers a subscription model for continuous monitoring to identify new vulnerabilities or security events as they emerge, moving beyond the point-in-time limitation of conventional audits.

Target Audience:
Stellar/Soroban developers and companies looking to deploy smart contracts on Stellar.

Benefits:
Significantly reduces the costs of audits, making security more accessible for a wider range of projects. Shortens the wait times for audits from months to seconds, facilitating faster development and deployment of projects. Transforms the auditing process from a snapshot in time to a continuous monitoring solution, enhancing ongoing security assurance.

How It Works and Its Use of Stellar/Soroban:
Almanax’s general functionalities include collecting and structuring Stellar/Soroban specific data from various sources, including publicly available Soroban audits and known vulnerabilities databases. Using this data to train an LLM and other AI algorithms, which are then fine-tuned to identify vulnerabilities in Soroban smart contracts and generate audit reports with recommended fixes specific to Soroban. The process involves detecting vulnerabilities, explaining their nature, proposing solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of these solutions through a feedback loop.",,,https://www.almanax.ai/,,https://youtu.be/olAUSF_YP8w?si=K2mhp5jbEf63FCZg,,,,,,,Francesco Piccoli,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/almanax-ai/,https://twitter.com/AlmanaxAI,,
StarLoom,SCF #26,StarLoom [SocioFi Launchpad],StarLoom,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recFkcjDsQUBAKlma,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$45900.00,$45900.00,409532.19,4/19/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"First decentralized Launchpad on Stellar with SocioFi features, community quests and engagement tools with Soroban integration","The main objective of StarLoom is to create a wholesome experience for projects launching their own tokens (and corresponding smart contracts), in particular facilitated by Soroban. One of the typical hurdles that projects face when trying to fundraise via a decentralized token sale is the inability to engage and gather the community. In fact, projects are almost expected to have a community before they are able to proceed to fundraising. However, even in that case, launchpads rarely provide the toolbox to create/test smart contracts, as well as have the ability to utilize transparent cliff/vesting functionalities or easily create snapshots with the following air-/retro-drops. StarLoom is aiming to become the ultimate Launchpad on Stellar blockchain to ensure a smooth launch and prosperity of great ideas.

Projects listed on our launchpad also benefit from a number of built-in tools at their disposal that allow for easier user engagement, brand building, content sharing and rewards. These benefits combined ensure a greater chance for a successful launch, as well as continued support after. Those include:

1. Custom no-code page builders - to allow the projects to share the valuable information, while employing their unique style, branding and more. This is a more user-friendly approach both to the project's appearance and retail client experience.
2. No-code campaign builders allow the project to create quest-like campaigns for the entire userbase of the platform to immediately witness and take part in. This way, not only the projects save time and money by having a simple solution to use without the need for other platforms, but also get to involve their direct target audience straight away.
3. Air- and retro-drops have become an integral part of any successful project's launch. However, due to the need of timely and user-transparent snapshots, followed by an equally complex mechanics to send out the rewards, many projects are often limited and otherwise occupied with unnecessary development of such mechanics. Our internal tools allow projects to perform air- and retro-drops in a transparent, efficient and economical manner.
4. Quests tiers can be customized and adopted by the projects to make sure that the users are engaged in meaningful tasks that unlock access to larger allocation. This is going to be especially effective with 'whales'. [Soroban-enabled]
5. Raffles, being rather self-explanatory, provide projects with an opportunity to hold raffles or lucky draws for their supporters for any asset, including physical and redeemables.
6. 'Happy Hour' is yet another marketing-gamification that would ensure a frequent monitoring from the userbase. Projects can set the Happy Hour, where all of the users participating in the IDO would receive a discount/bonus tokens during the indicated time and circumstances. This also would force the spawn of community-driven monitoring systems, Telegram and Twitter bots with announcements. [Soroban-enabled]
7. Rocket Race mechanic acts as a duel system, where a project would be able to challenge another project to receive the most support from the community. During the Rocket Race duel, the participants lock an equal amount of funds into the pool and the race commences. The winner then receives our marketing/boosting activities (on external media outlets), while both projects would be featured on the main page. This is an additional mode to those described in retail user section. [Soroban-enabled]

User engagement with the launchpad's projects is the key to successful launch. That's why we have devised a social scoring system with GameFi tier mechanics to make user experience more involving, rewarding and entertaining. Those include:

1. Community voting system - where the users directly vote for the projects they believe in. Not only this provides newcomers with a transparent way of filtering the most popular projects, but also boosts projects' confidence and provides direct metric of support. Furthermore, users inherently get a limited number of upvotes, so they need to spread them wisely. However, upon reaching higher tiers they would have more upvotes to spend, as well as the weight of their votes would be higher. This way, each upvoted project would have a dual social score - overall number of votes and weighted votes (shows where the whales/OGs are).
2. Rocket Race mechanic allows projects to participate in the battle of brands, where the retail users will be able to support either of the participants. This mechanic has 2 game modes. In the first, each project allocates an equal amount (stablecoins or platform's native tokens) to the prize pool, where the winning team takes all (minus a small commission of the platform). This way the projects benefit from increased engagement with the launchpad's community, front page banner and corresponding announcement. The second mode allows the participating projects to allocate an equal value in their tokens to the prize pool, where the winning team would receive the loser's token pool to be distributed according to the user's impact in the voting. This way the winning team receives additional tokens from a project they did not participate in, thus benefiting the users directly, while the losing project receives additional exposure and holders (alike airdrop).
3. Since it's in human nature to seek collaboration and to flock, our Guild mechanic would allow to create such groups with their own tiers, ratings, gated and non-gated discussions and content. This way, not only it rewards active, knowledgeable and profitable users, but allows to communicate easily within such communities. Additionally, it becomes easier for the projects to appeal to the entire Guild and enlist its support. [Soroban-enabled]
4. Guilds also benefit from and encourage higher activity from their members by getting access to various platform's perks, discounts, higher allocations and more.
5. 'I bet you will' mechanic is similar to the quests conducted by the projects (see campaign builders), but follows the steps of the eponymous TV show and therefore serves the entertainment/challenge purpose for the retail users. Under this mechanic the users are able to create free-for-all or gated challenges with various rewards. As the common sense dictates, a set of rules and moderation would be required. [Soroban-enabled]

Other Quality of Life and utility features that our team found important for the overall satisfaction of both ends of the platform's users described below:

1. P2P pre-market trading, as the name suggests allows for the users who participate in a project's launch to trade their assets before the official listing and corresponding trading on exchanges happens. This allows for the two scenarios to occur, namely the users to freely exchange their newly acquired tokens for other tokens of the launchpad, and to sell a specific token to make an exit. While this idea is simple, it provides increased liquidity for the owners and additional flexibility to investment strategies. Moreover, it creates a whole new secondary market, which in turn creates higher user activity and increased publicity.
2. Refund system serves a few purposes. On the one hand, the projects that opt-in for this feature are automatically issued a publicly visible badge as a means of communicating its transparency, trustworthiness and confidence. Consequently, the increased safety measures amplify users' trust, therefore resulting in higher investment amounts and general trust in the project. Please note that the Refund will only be available for 7 days and is subject to the project agreeing to use this feature voluntarily. [Soroban-enabled]
3. Referral cashback for projects means that projects can receive cashback on the launchpad's commission, if the users participate in the launch via the referral link. While in practice this will result in decreased profits for the launchpad itself, it provides the projects with an additional incentive to further boost their social media promotions and save money in the meantime. In the end, many projects require a launchpad's infrastructure, while having their own dedicated community already.
4. Referral system for retail users is a modification of the referral system available for projects. Retail users will be able to invite their friends to participate in the project's launch and receive various perks ranging from native social points and tokens of the launchpad to additional airdrops. This not only ensures additional incentives for the active community members, but also boosts projects' promotional activities via the word of mouth. Moreover, users also receive internal point rewards for the general referrals brought to the launchpad with their referral links. In turn, those points will unlock additional perks, access to higher Tiers and allocations and later would be exchangeable for the native tokens of the platform.
5. Tiered marketing boosting is an initiative of the launchpad that essentially states that upon reaching certain Tiers, the project will unlock various benefits like discounts on marketing activities (with press releases on top crypto news and media outlets), AMA sessions, access to the industry's KOLs and more. Furthermore, since it is in the best interest of the launchpad to see more successful launches, our team will ensure best possible marketing support for the worthy projects.

Points system acts as the immediate visual reward for the users based on their activities and thereby shows the social status within the ecosystem. Those points can both be earned and spent based on what the user does, as well as converted into the launchpad's native utility token. Points are associated with a number of paths, such as:

First wallet connection - 10 points earned
KYC completed (non-compulsory) - 50 points earned
A new referral brought to the launchpad - both earn 5 points each
A new referral completes KYC - 10 points earned
Log in to the launchpad 7 days in a row - boost your token earnings x2

NB. points system is subject to potential change and will be announced accordingly

Depending on the account's Tier, there also exists a progressive multiplier for points earning. Moreover, the points used within the launchpad do not decrease the account's Tier, while converting points into the native utility token does. However, holding (staking) and using the native utility token also grants additional benefits, with some of the activities being accessible only via the use of the token.

Benefits to completing a KYC:

Tier increased by 1
Increased allowed allocation portion
Higher voting power (weight) of the dedicated points

Our core offering is a unified API designed for efficiently transacting with chains and protocols and sourcing on-chain data, which saves our users significant time and money to access the vast, fragmented Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging our middleware, users can efficiently connect to over 100 distinct endpoints, including chains, DEXs, lending protocols, DEX & yield aggregators, oracles, bridges, and more. Essentially, Expand’s API serves as a single point of access for the Web3 ecosystem, allowing users to quickly and efficiently interact with over 40 different blockchains and protocols.

The Web3 ecosystem is vast, fragmented, and constantly changing. As a result, those building in Web3 and interacting with chains and protocols incur high resource costs and time delays to build and maintain integrations with multiple chains and protocols. This often hinders experimentation, innovation, and ecosystem in Web3. Our goal at Expand is to provide reliable infrastructure that reduces the barriers to iterating with blockchains and protocols, and helps to grow the Web3 ecosystem in an efficient, scalable, and secure manner. Expand’s API solves this problem by functioning as a single point of access for the Web3 ecosystem, allowing users to quickly and efficiently transact with the blockchains and protocols of their choice. By connecting to a single unified API, users can access over 40 chains and protocols and over 100 distinct endpoints, eliminating the need for users to build and maintain these integrations themselves. Users can get up and running more quickly, explore new chains and protocols more easily, and focus their attention on their core priorities.

Expand serves a broad user base that includes trading firms, asset managers & VCs, research analysts, wallets, dapps, tax & accounting firms, and other service providers. Given the diverse applications of the API, virtually every digital asset client type can potentially find valuable uses of the API for their needs. The API allows users to seamlessly transact across the Web3 ecosystem, access on-chain data, monitor chains and protocols, and build DeFi-related features like swaps and lending. Some examples of popular cases include Liquidity Pool Forensics, Portfolio Management, Trading, Transaction & Pool Analysis, and Trade Reconciliation. Whether you are a wallet looking to build swaps or lending features into your front end, a developer seeking to create a prototype, or a research analyst interested in analyzing and monitoring liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges, the Expand API is designed to assist you in achieving your goals more efficiently, saving both time and money.

Expand offers a single unified API with both read and write capabilities that users can leverage to access over 100 distinct Web3 endpoints and over 40 different chains and protocols. The Expand API is designed to be non-custodial and wallet agnostic, allowing the user to select the wallet of their choice when using the API, and preserving control and privacy over their keys at all times. Transactions occur in a secure three-part process: 1) First, a transaction is prepared using the expand.network API. 2) Then the transaction object is securely sent to the wallet for signing. 3) Finally, the Expand API will broadcast the encoded string to the respective chain.

The specifications are platform agnostic, although the implementation guidelines and examples are focused on Soroban, a Rust-based smart contract platform. The goal for GML is to provide a comprehensive toolkit and instructions set for enhancing DAOs and dApps governance, to demonstrate and spread software development best practices to accelerate innovation in - and adoption of - Soroban as an ecosystem by providing a “batteries-included experience”. This needs active maintenance and development of new modules, especially when done as a public good. This library is intended for community governance and development. While in the bootstrapping phase of this project, we see the need to facilitate active community management to help onboard new maintainers, manage existing community members, and facilitate the active collaboration. This active community management is included in this grant, but is planned to be taken over by the community whenever feasible. Our aim is to transfer ownership and control of all project work to the open-source community. The GML contains documentation for each module as well as a Proof of Concept (PoC) through simulations. Documentation can be found in this GitBook site and demos can be found in this GitHub repo. Initially, the GML included three modules: Neural Governance (NG), Quorum Delegation (QD), and the Tier-based Role Certifier (TRC), and our goal is that the size will grow through the Community input both directly (by submitting new modules) and indirectly (by expressing demand and ideas for library maintainers to help integrate). The initial infrastructure, processes, and workflows for the GML are complete, along with initial governance modules. The aim of this post-award resubmission is to build on the initial, completed development efforts to deepen the library with more governance modules, to make it easier for developers to compose a broader range of governance processes. This could include conviction voting (time weighted preference signaling, as used in 1Hive DAO), retroactive funding (as used in Optimism DAO RPGF), osmotic governance, and multi-track governance. The GML lives in the SCF Handbook GitBook page and each Module in it consists of a series of documents and examples-by-simulation that describe at least the following: 1) Summary, 2) Use Cases, 3) User Journey, 4) Module-specific Adjustments, 5) Specification, 6) Implementation Instructions, 7) Tuning Guidelines, and 8) Simulations. Each one of them are templates that can be readily implemented and tuned to specific applications that depend on or require governance solutions. Because Governance is a wide topic, the library is categorized by templates across typical Web3 use cases. The GML is not intended to be static but rather a living library, to be embraced by the Stellar ecosystem, including other grantees, builders, and developers from other ecosystems that want to contribute to OS, as a source and destination for Governance Modules.

OnBoarding Club,SCF #26,Onboarding.club,OnBoarding Club,Education & Community,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recxmriAgwEaO7GwF,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$90000.00,$90000.00,845249.79,5/9/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"Onboarding builders across emerging ecosystems with a unified platform for curated resources, bounties, jobs, grants and more.","Recognizing the untapped potential in the Asian market, particularly in India and Vietnam, we've identified a significant opportunity to engage skilled developers and bolster the Stellar ecosystem.

In our upcoming efforts, we plan to amplify our developer outreach through a series of in-person hackathons spanning India and Vietnam, complementing our ongoing engagements within technical college circuits. This strategic approach aims to cultivate robust builder communities in these regions.

Overall Mission:
- Host 10 developer workshops across India, facilitating Stellar and Soroban onboarding.
- Organize three weekend hackathons, culminating in a nationwide event.
- Establish a week-long Soroban Builders' Residency in Bangalore, India's tech hub, gathering the top 20 developers from workshops, hackathons, and online applications. These developers will collaborate on impactful projects, mentored by Onboarding.club and ideally, representatives from the Stellar Foundation.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Targeting 100+ participants per event.
- Aiming for the development of at least 50 projects during the hackathons.
- Supporting a minimum of 10 projects for further development on Stellar, with potential backing from the SCF.

Addressing a prevalent concern voiced by builders during our interactions, we've identified the need for a robust solution to verify builder legitimacy and credibility. Introducing our cutting-edge Proof of Reputation (PoR) Engine, the Orion Ring on Onboarding.club, designed to authenticate developer activity on-chain via Stellar.

Data Sources for PoR:
- Developer contributions and project data from GitLab and GitHub.
- Skills and language proficiency derived from projects on GitHub.
- Community engagement metrics from platforms like Stack Overflow, Warpcast, and Discord.
- On-chain data tracking blockchain activity, including contracts deployed and proposals voted.
- Onboarding.club platform activity data.
- Attestations and peer reviews from previous employers for work experience and performance.

How PoR Works:
User data from these diverse sources is aggregated and stored as metadata, forming the basis of a dynamic Reputation Score. Advanced metrics and segmentation continuously refine this score, providing a transparent assessment of a developer's credibility.

Beneficiaries of PoR:
- Empowering builders to showcase their work transparently.
- Facilitating better hiring decisions for organizations through verified credentials.
- Assisting foundations in evaluating builders effectively and deterring grant exploitation.
- Encouraging Open Source Development and promoting genuine builder profiles.
- Safeguarding against fraudulent activities such as backdated Git commits and falsified credentials.

Utilizing Soroban:
Our vision entails integrating Soroban for on-chain verification, leveraging its high transaction speed and minimal gas fees. Each user profile will be linked to a mutable Soul Bound Token (SBT), with metadata stored on IPFS for efficient, verifiable data storage.

Course Creation:
Expanding on our current courses listed on the platform, we're developing intermediate to advanced courses on Soroban, enhancing the learning experience through gamification and NFT rewards for course completion. Our platform tracks user engagement, ensuring content comprehension before badge issuance.

IDE Integration:
Integrating Sorobix IDE, we aim to streamline the learning process and facilitate contract deployment for new developers, aligning with Soroban's architecture updates and mainnet deployment.

Bounties:
Building on our previous efforts, we plan to extend bounty outreach to other Stellar projects, leveraging our growing developer community's expertise and engagement.",,,https://onboarding.club,,https://youtu.be/Dn1MbCMiKMk,,,,,,,Rishabh Keshan,,,,,
EquitX,SCF #26,EquitX: Invest in Small Caps,EquitX,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recgGcVWMy7qp8CAd,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$45300.00,$45300.00,400672.91,4/25/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Seamlessly diversify your portfolio by investing in small-cap stocks as crypto assets on the Stellar blockchain.,"EquitX is a pioneering platform built on Stellar, specifically designed to democratize access to investments in nano-cap (less than $50M), micro-cap ($50M to $300M), and small-cap companies ($300M to $2bn). By generating synthetic assets that mirror the stock performance of these companies, EquitX offers a gateway to a segment of the market that is often out of reach due to high volatility, lower liquidity, and limited visibility. This innovative approach unlocks new investment opportunities, showcasing the untapped growth potential within these smaller enterprises.

The investment landscape for nano-cap, micro-cap, and small-cap companies is fraught with challenges, including heightened volatility, reduced liquidity, and scarce visibility compared to larger entities. These factors deter many potential investors, leaving numerous promising companies underexplored and underfunded.

Individual Blockchain-Savvy Investors: EquitX is keenly focused on attracting individual investors familiar with blockchain technology and dApps. Our platform offers these investors an innovative way to diversify their portfolios into traditional finance sectors, like nano-cap, micro-cap, and small-cap companies, without departing from the crypto ecosystem. This approach allows investors to potentially benefit from the growth of these companies while enjoying the tax advantages associated with not taking their crypto profits. These blockchain-savvy individuals, comfortable with navigating the complexities of dApps, will serve as our pioneering user base, leveraging EquitX to bridge their crypto investments with traditional financial markets.

Individual non-crypto native Investors: In anticipation of future growth, EquitX will be developing a more accessible interface aimed at non-crypto users. This interface will enable users to purchase eAssets directly with fiat currencies, tapping into the liquidity provided by DEXs. This strategic move is designed to open the doors to traditional finance for those less familiar with blockchain technology, allowing them to participate in the earnings from stability pools. By simplifying the investment process and removing the need to directly interact with blockchain's more complex aspects, EquitX aims to make investing in nano-cap, micro-cap, and small-cap companies through synthetic assets appealing and accessible to a broader audience.

For Companies: EquitX provides nano, micro, and small-cap companies with an alternative platform to increase their exposure and engage with a diverse investor base. This is particularly beneficial within the French market and, eventually, other markets as EquitX expands. By representing their stocks as eAssets on our platform, these companies can enhance their visibility and liquidity without the conventional drawbacks of fundraising, such as equity dilution.

Benefits of EquitX: Broader Exposure for Companies: Facilitates enhanced visibility and investor engagement for nano, micro, and small-cap companies, often overlooked on conventional investment platforms. Market Accessibility: Dramatically lowers the barriers for engaging with nano, micro, and small-cap investments, broadening the investor base. Security and Transparency: Employs Stellar's blockchain and Soroban smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and efficient transactions. Passive Income Opportunities: Introduces stability pools, allowing investors to earn passive income through participation in liquidity provision and market stabilization efforts.

EquitX will initially target the French market, leveraging our in-depth understanding of local regulatory laws and establishing direct connections with companies. This strategic entry point allows us to fine-tune our platform, ensuring it aligns with local market needs and regulatory requirements, laying a solid foundation for success. Building on our foothold in France, EquitX plans to expand into other European countries, adapting our approach to meet the diverse regulatory landscapes and market dynamics across the continent.

Here are some examples of companies for which we could synthesize shares: Lectra, a €1.84bn small cap, which is the world leader in leather cutting for the fashion, automotive and furniture industries. Kalray, a €160m microcap developing microprocessors optimized for AI. NFL Biosciences, a €22m nano-cap developing an anti-smoking addiction drug currently undergoing FDA approval. As you can see, we don't focus on any particular industry, but rather on companies with an interesting profile. Then, the idea will be to let the platform's users decide which companies they would like to have through a decentralized voting system.

EquitX leverages Soroban smart contracts to create a dynamic platform for synthetic assets, mirroring the performance of small-cap companies shares. These synthetic assets allow investors to partake in the growth potential of small-cap companies with enhanced liquidity and lower entry barriers. Collateral and Liquidation Mechanism: Investors provide collateral to mint synthetic assets, ensuring a stable foundation for each asset with a comprehensive liquidation mechanism to mitigate market volatility. Earning Interests through Stability Pools: EquitX introduces stability pools as a novel feature for investors to earn passive income, especially beneficial during market downturns or corrections. Governance and Risk Mitigation: The platform adopts a decentralized governance model, enabling stakeholders to make critical decisions regarding the platform's operations and asset offerings, ensuring that EquitX remains aligned with the needs of its community and the market. Efficiency and Accessibility via Soroban: The utilization of Soroban smart contracts streamlines the transaction process, making the platform not only more secure and transparent but also user-friendly for a diverse investor base.

Use Case: Minting eKalray on EquitX Background: Assume you're an investor interested in the semiconductor industry, particularly in Kalray, a company known for its innovative technologies. You wish to invest in Kalray through EquitX by minting a synthetic asset, eKalray, which tracks the performance of Kalray's stock. Step 1: Wallet Setup: You start by setting up a Stellar-compatible wallet (e.g. Freighter, etc), ensuring it's secure and backed up. Step 2: Acquiring Collateral: Next, you acquire a sufficient amount of the accepted collateral on EquitX, that is Stellar Lumens (XLM), to cover the minting of eKalray, keeping in mind the platform's required collateralization ratio, estimated at 150% but may vary. Step 3: Connecting to EquitX: With your wallet ready and funded, you connect it to EquitX via the platform's web interface, ensuring a secure connection. Step 4: Choosing eKalray: In the minting section, you find eKalray listed among the available eAssets. This synthetic asset represents Kalray's stock, and you decide to mint it to gain exposure to Kalray's market performance. Step 5: Collateral Deposit: You proceed to deposit your XLM as collateral. EquitX displays the minimum collateralization ratio (e.g., 150%). You input the amount of eKalray you wish to mint, and the platform calculates the required XLM amount. You confirm and deposit the XLM. Step 6: Minting eKalray: After depositing the collateral, you confirm the details and mint the desired amount of eKalray. The EquitX platform uses Soroban smart contracts to create the eKalray assets, which then appear in your wallet. Step 7: Managing Your eKalray Position: As an eKalray holder, you decide to participate in the eKalray stability pool on EquitX, contributing some of your eKalray assets. This participation helps stabilize the eKalray market and earns you rewards. Considering market dynamics, you also choose to sell some eKalray on a DEX, creating a short position on Kalray's stock. This diversifies your investment strategy and potentially increases your return on investment. Stability Pool Dynamics: When there's a liquidation event in the eKalray market, a portion of your eKalray assets in the stability pool may be burnt to cover the liquidated position. In return, you receive a premium, calculated as the difference between the full minted value of eKalray (100%) and the collateralization ratio of the liquidated party at the time of liquidation. Step 8: Closing Your Position: When you decide to close your position, you repay the eKalray you've minted, as well as any fees. Remember, you had to buy back some of the eKalray on a dex to own as many eKalray as you originally minted. Your XLM collateral is then unlocked and returned to you.

Additional Note: Buying eKalray on a DEX As eKalray is traded on a DEX, investors not interested in minting can directly purchase eKalray without needing collateral. This opens up opportunities for those looking to take a long position on Kalray's stock, further increasing the liquidity and accessibility of eKalray on the EquitX platform. This use case demonstrates how investors can engage with specific industries or companies like Kalray through synthetic assets on EquitX, leveraging blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and innovative investment opportunities.

The financing gap in Africa is $421 billion, with Tanzania alone facing a $7.5 billion financing gap. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), financial institutions that are providing credit geared towards SMEs and women-owned businesses, aiming to bridge this gap also face limitations in resources, especially funding access. The inadequate funding access impedes their ability to scale effectively, thereby constraining their potential contribution to the economy, as a result this obstructs the economic growth of SMEs and women-owned businesses. One of the main reasons for inadequate funding access is the limited transparency and thereby limited trust, making it harder to raise funding. This financial landscape is not unique to Africa, as many regions worldwide, particularly in developing economies, grapple with limited transparency and thereby accessibility in funding. This opacity not only obstructs the growth of SMEs and women-owned businesses but also undermines the integrity of the financial system, fostering inefficiencies and fraud.

The ClickPesa Debt Fund introduces a solution that maintains traceability entirely on-chain, making each step in the lending chain—from disbursement to repayment—fully verifiable and transparent. We ensuring that every transaction is recorded and accessible, by leveraging our licensed payment gateway ClickPesa, which is already integrated with the Stellar network for on/off ramp and merchant wallets infrastructure. By utilizing Soroban smart contracts we can further automate and simplify end-to-end traceability in the lending process. The intentions are to bring enhanced transparency to DeFi lending. This approach not only increases confidence among investors by providing clear visibility into the flow of funds but also enhances the ability for SMEs and women-owned business in Africa to secure necessary financing under fair conditions.

Target Audience and Their Benefits:
Lenders benefit from increased transparency, which reduces risk and provides clearer insight into how their funds are being utilized.
MFIs gain better access to funds through a transparent platform, enabling them to expand their operations and support more SMEs and women-owned businesses efficiently.
SMEs and women-owned business benefit from more readily available funding opportunities, facilitating growth and operational stability.

How does it work and how does it uses Stellar and Soroban
ClickPesa utilizes the Stellar Network for its robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure, which is ideal for handling cost efficient and reliable transactions. On top of this, we planning to employ Soroban smart contracts with the ClickPesa Debt Fund to automate and secure the lending process:
Disbursement and Collection Visibility: Smart contracts track and verify the actual flow of funds to and from MFIs, ensuring all parties adhere to agreed terms.
Fee Transparency: All fees charged during the lending process are recorded and made visible through the blockchain, preventing hidden charges and fostering trust.
Automated Execution: Our platform automates transactions such as fund disbursements and repayments based on predefined criteria or milestones. For example, when a payment is made, the smart contract automatically executes the necessary actions, such as refunding money back to the appropriate entity.",,,https://clickpesadebtfund.com,,https://youtu.be/pMa1aHESACQ,,,,,,,"Rick Groothuizen, rlematz ",,,,,

Each ICHI Vault connects to liquidity pools on leading AMMs to provide asset owners with a staking-like experience for providing liquidity. Users deposit a single asset which is then allocated into an underlying liquidity pool to earn yield from liquidity provision. The vault automatically manages the liquidity position as inventory changes and fees and rewards are accrued. Users are able to withdraw their liquidity at any time and never lose custody. Vaults are designed first to protect user deposits and leverage customized strategies depending on asset types.

The $ICHI token will be bridged, likely using Axelar or Allbridge depending on availability, to Stellar as the governance token for the ICHI ALM but also as the best asset for new tokens to pair with to facilitate sustainable trading volume and liquidity provision. We are in conversations with the Stellar team as well as bridge teams themselves to bridge the $ICHI token.

Strategies are optimized to support specific token types. This means that concentration levels, rebalance settings, and fee optimization settings for managed liquidity from a given vault are configured based on the type of assets in the liquidity pool. Pegged assets will have higher concentration than uncorrelated volatile asset pairs for example. Strategies include:

YieldIQ: Volatile asset pairs (e.g. XLM/VELO)

Flip: Stablecoin and pegged asset pairs (e.g. USDC/ZUSD)

Ascend: Liquid staking tokens wrapped on Stellar (e.g. wMATICx/wMATIC)

Amplifi: Network tokens (e.g. XLM)

Blockchain based, real-time payments are closer to becoming a reality, however, while payments on Stellar take only a few seconds to complete, the onramping and offramping of money through cards is still slowing down the process for financial institutions. While local government initiatives like ACH (US), SEPA (EU) and others make cheap and instant acquiring a reality, card payments are still very much the norm. Unfortunately, card payments are settled in no less than 24 hours after receiving the payment confirmation, at best, unless you are willing to pay predatory fees in order to get the money right away. These costs are then passed down to the client in international transfers and other operations, making it a very unfair situation for the senders, and the recipients will have to wait various days for the final amount to arrive unless they are willing to pay the high prices of instant (pre-funded) transfers.

By signing up to Clear, payment companies will no longer have this issue, as they’ll be able to access short-term liquidity provided by individuals through our Webapp. Finally, financial institutions can enjoy instant settlements of card payments for a non-predatory price, while being able to offer cheap and instant transfers for their customers.

Clear solves this by offering payment companies: Instant Deep Liquidity, Simple Pricing, Flexible repayments, and a tech-free integration through a dashboard or a simple API integration. Payment companies will be able to apply to this liquidity but will have to undergo a rigorous KYB process beforehand, in order to ensure that the companies are legit and able to operate before accessing funds. This is done in order to maximize the security of the deposits of end-users.

On the other side, liquidity will be provided by individuals looking to obtain interest payments. By adding funds to the liquidity pool, they will be given daily payouts, based on the EoD amount that has been used up by the previously approved Payment Institutions. Liquidity, as well as rewards in the form of loan interest payments, will be paid out in USDC and will bear a flat daily interest of the total amount loaned out, and will be distributed according to the % share of the liquidity pool that each individual has.

In order to make this a reality we will have to create the following: Smart contract system - This will self execute the payments based on the amount used by the payment institutions, the time they’ve taken to repay and the interests offered in exchange for the daily upfront liquidity.

And; 3-sided Webapp - Where customers can login using “Wallet-connect” to deposit USDC for the liquidity pool and view their transaction history as well as the interests earned, Payment Companies can request liquidity and manage their account and an admin dashboard.

In order to protect individuals who are giving out loans, our dashboard will display publicly the amount that each PI has asked for (while remaining anonymous), as well as their repayment history. Based on this and for customer simplicity, we will add a public credit score (Clear score). If a Payment institution pays late, their score will decrease until the point where they won’t be allowed to access the liquidity pool. If they fail to pay, they will be automatically expelled. In order to make sure that Payment institutions don’t cheat the system by taking out a large loan and not pay it back, there will be a progressive system in place, where they will only be able to access a small amount at first, and progressively build up to larger amounts as they prove their ability to pay back, much like the current credit system.

Clear’s aim is to improve access to liquidity which nowadays is trapped and badly managed by a few Financial institutions. This will also allow individuals, with small amounts of funds, to access a market which is completely inaccessible for them right now. Join Clear’s mission to make the short term loan market efficient, and that all individuals, not just a handful, can benefit from it.",,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HPTGRLeHs5WRlV3d0yxdML6_f7SGfvt/view?usp=sharing,,https://youtu.be/-K9u3Y1xdPQ,,,,,,,"Alvaro Martinez Esteban, Ignacio Jimenez de Laiglesia",,,,,

Goal: Empowering charities focused on underprivileged children through a sustainable and transparent, Stellar-powered fundraising and fund distribution platform.

The Problem We're Solving: There are over 98 million out-of-school children in Africa (200 million worldwide), and those still in school lack basic learning materials to achieve their dreams. The next generation of digital technologists needs help. NGOs like The Helpmates Foundation and Teens Trust Foundation struggle to raise funds for their annual school initiatives due to the country's dire economic situation.

Summarily:
- NGOs face significant challenges in raising funds for educational initiatives due to economic constraints.
- There is a high number of out-of-school children, and those in school often need more essential learning materials.
- Raising and distributing funds needs more transparency, affecting donor confidence and willingness to contribute.

Overall results with Activation stage:
1. Beta Phase: We started the beta phase with two NGOs, The Helpmates Foundation and Teen Trust Foundation where we refined our product development and also submitted tens of transactions to the Stellar Testnet Network. We also started signing up NGOs on our waitlist during this period.

2. Public Launch: We launched! Our public launch has been with great praise. Here are our results so far and counting:
A - We've signed 20 NGOs/charities on our platform. These NGOs have a combined outreach of 1 million kids across Nigeria. We're currently in talks with onboarding NGOs in other African countries like Ghana.
B - Over 1,000,000 naira has been raised from campaigns. We currently support XLM and USDC donations. We're working on integrating more currencies like Naira and Ghana's Cedis.
C - The platform has reduced the average time from fundraising to fund distribution to under 1 hour, a significant improvement over traditional methods. For example, GoFundMe takes 3-5 business days.
D - More people now know how blazingly fast and cheap the Stellar blockchain is. Compared to traditional platforms like GoFundMe, which charge 2-3% for donations, our transactions vary between 0.00001 and 0.0005 XLM! How amazing!

The heart of IDUNU's success lies in its integration with the Stellar blockchain network. Stellar's open blockchain payment system offers unparalleled price, security, and transparency for online transactions, making it an ideal backbone for a platform like IDUNU. By bridging the gap between donors' generosity and children's needs, IDUNU stands as a testament to the power of technology to drive social change.

For the community stage, we will be building the following features:
1. Charity Pay - Simplifying Donations: This payment link feature allows NGOs to create standalone payment pages independent of specific campaigns. It will build upon the Stellar transactions system we've built. This flexibility enables organizations to receive funds for general purposes, catering to operational costs or emergent needs that might not be tied to a particular project.
2. Support for more currencies - Broadening Donor Base: We currently support USDC and XLM. This works really well now because it caters to the platform's biggest donors, who are from the diaspora community. In 2023, over 200 million migrant workers sent $669 billion to people back home in low- and middle-income countries. Integration to Stellar Anchor, Busha has helped with fund distribution, but as we expand to more African countries, we need to support more currencies. We will do this by integrating more of Busha's Stellar Anchor facilities and exploring integrations with Stellar Anchors in other countries like Ghana, such as Flutterwave and Yellowcard. Our integration with LINK.io's NGN token was put on hold because of current Nigerian regulatory issues and their restrictive integration policies, but we plan to revisit our collaboration.
3. Diverse Wallet Integrations - Support for more wallets: We currently only do Stellar Freighter Wallet. For the community awards stage, we will support Xbull, Albedo, Ledger, WalletConnect, etc.
4. Receipts for Tax purposes - Donation tax deduction receipt: To encourage and reward charitable giving, the platform will provide auto-generated donation tax deduction receipts showing verifiable Stellar chain-based proof, making it easier for donors to claim tax benefits.
5. Proof of donation NFT: When we finish our core deliverables for this stage, we will provide Proof of donation NFTs to donors using Soroban smart contracts. This feature offers a novel digital token of appreciation that serves as a memento of their generosity and opens up new avenues for engaging and motivating the donor community. This will be done freely as a volunteer act and is not included in our budget.
6. Personalized Charity Page: Each NGO will have its own page, just like a GoFundMe charity page, showing all its campaigns, donations, and community updates from the charity.
7. Extensive Donation Subscription System - Ensuring Sustained Support: NGOs can get a consistent/ongoing stream of donations from donors interested in their mission. We will set up a system that accepts donors' emails, automatically creates payment links, and sends periodic (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual) reminders to the specified donor lists.

These features are critical to the long-term sustainability of the charities and our platform, and we're excited to get started!",,,https://www.idunu.org/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVmO2tsZuio,,,,,,,infovore ,,,,,

Mercury,SCF #25,The Mercury Ecosystem,Mercury,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/reckeu03BF6X1OFq7,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$100000.00,$100000.00,1022967.67,6/12/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,Mercury is an efficient and already-running (testnet and mainnet) indexing service which we're looking to scale.,"The introduction of protocol 20 led to new challenges with respect to on-chain data access, signaling the need for complex, granular and customizable data retrieval. That’s where indexers come into the picture, trying to fill the gap between on-chain projects and efficient data fetching. Mercury is a managed indexer specifically tailored for the Stellar-Soroban ecosystem built by the Xycloo Labs team. Its architecture allows for high efficiency which is reflected on the end user experience as fast, reliable, granular and cheap data indexing. To learn more about Mercury’s advantages and how we tackle the new challenges of data needs on the network check out https://blog.xycloo.com/blog/explaining-mercury-stellar-event.

Many important projects being built on Stellar and Soroban are already relying on Mercury for their data indexing: the Freighter Wallet, Soroswap Finance, Soroban Governor, Kwickbit, SmartDeploy, xycLoans and individuals. Their teams are working closely with Tommaso aka tdep (our lead developer), especially for what concerns the integration with Zephyr, as we still need to integrate a more complete SDK and facilitate the developer experience (more on that later). We believe that this is already a good amount of traction given that Soroban has just now started getting traction and the service has been operational only for a couple of months. However, we’ve noticed that:

Once clients start relying on Mercury and get past the initial learning curve, they always continue working with us.

We’ve only worked closely with projects whose developers were already very familiar with Stellar and Soroban.

There’s a good percentage of customers we recognized to have less experience with Soroban that signed up or requested access and then didn’t persist with using the service.

The above insights have led us to formulate what is one of the two main components of this submission: making Mercury a fully-featured data-related ecosystem. With this submission we propose to implement and outline Mercury's significant potential to capture a substantial market share and establish itself as a leader in developing services that bridge the gap between the network’s data and various user groups, including developers, traders, and general users. We want to make Mercury the one-stop service to plug-in projects, set up simple or complex data workflows, simulate transactions, build bots, explore and test contracts, and possibly other data-related features that can scale up the workflows of projects building on Soroban and Stellar. All of this would be accessible to all users in a user-friendly Mercury ecosystem dashboard that doesn’t necessarily require a deep understanding of the underlying network data structure or format, and providing features such as auto-generated code for frontends when interacting with Mercury.

We also believe that it is crucial in this phase of users and developers onboarding for Soroban to provide the network with the best infrastructure possible in order to reduce at maximum the entry barriers. Having a powerful, managed, omni-comprehensive and user-friendly environment to deal with network’s data is a huge step forward in that direction, making available a full suite of components that would significantly simplify the processes.

More concretely, the submission can be split in two components (not necessarily of equal amount of work):

Scaling the ZephyrVM integration.

Building the “Mercury ecosystem”.

Scaling the ZephyrVM integration

The current version of the ZephyrVM works well, but only for teams that are much familiar with Soroban and Rust (outlining the need for better tooling and more work on the SDK). Additionally, the ZephyrVM is meant to replace the need of running your own infrastructure with an indexer and retrieve in real time what you want (with total customizability) from the network by writing a “simple” program, and there are still many features missing to achieve real feature completion and have the service be in fact comparable with running your own infrastructure, including database-related features (full control over your tables or defining your own queries, which is currently done manually), and VM-specific improvements on the host environment to allow for more functionality (testing toolkit, better database client, env objects for optimization, websocket alerts, etc). Another very powerful feature we also want to implement is to allow for a serverless-alike functionality for certain defined functions, so that they can also potentially process their own queries in case the custom querying functionality we already aim to implement isn’t enough. The ability to define such functions within your Zephyr program allows you to have full control over your tables (for example, have authorized functions that load data in the tables if required), over the querying (for if you need to for instance process scvals in the queries or simply need to form highly complex queries). Additionally, for programs that only need to access the current state (imagine an AMM router) you can write zephyr serverless functions to give the best path by simply accessing the ledger state and processing it, making it cheaper as it won’t be executed for every ledger close. Specifics about these improvements can be found in the architecture document. This part of the submission, while probably the most “boring” one (thus why most of the details are in the architecture docs), is one of the most important and expensive in terms of time required. A complete ZephyrVM integration can be extremely powerful for the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem, extensively tightening the gap between projects and custom processed data. Once the code is safe we will also open-source the ZephyrVM (the code is currently available for a few trusted testers) and publish an open-source indexer reliant on zephyr programs which you can connect to your database. We still strongly believe that one of the biggest advantages of using Zephyr is for it to be no-setup without having to bear infra costs and maintenance, but some services might prefer their indexing to run on their own servers with the ability to build the ingestion logic leveraging the Zephyr SDK along with its tooling. The ZephyrVM integration is also part of the Mercury Ecosystem we describe below, having also it’s management panel in the Mercury Dashboard we will later describe:

Building the Mercury Ecosystem

Completing the ZephyrVM integration means that the ecosystem can now rely either on Mercury to easily subscribe and retrieve data directly from stellar core, or on a Zephyr program for when Mercury’s pre-built structures aren’t enough for the use-case. However, as mentioned before, we see the potential for Mercury to grow beyond its current state. To make Mercury the one-stop for projects to scale their on-chain apps, we propose 3 macro-components:

The Mercury dashboard and related components.

The Mercury “simulator” and ledger API.

Testing studio.

Simulator and Ledger API

We want projects and users that rely on Mercury to avoid the necessity of depending also on additional services to simulate their transactions or to access ledger entries (the two most common practices of the RPC). Because we’re obviously already running our stellar core nodes to provide customers with data directly from the network, there’s no added cost for us to implement a very lightweight and graphql version of the RPC’s getLedgerEntries method. This ledger API can be easily integrated into a Mercury-specific fork of the new versions of Soroflare, an open source wrapper of Soroban’s simulation with the possibility of customizing the ledger in the VMs state, also built by Tommaso (note: the work on Soroflare is not part of this submission). The resulting integration, along with a very light Mercury SDK (wrapper of stellar-sdk tx assembly for working with Mercury), will enable our customers to simulate their Soroban transactions and obtain the current ledger entries with expiration as well (note that the entries functionality already exists in Mercury, but will store the entire history of the entry). Note that the simulator is not a Soroban RPC and due to its design has also an important part of Mercury’s “testing studio”, which as you’ll see below powers both Zephyr and Soroban testing activities.

Testing Studio

While it’s relatively easy to write Zephyr code for Rust-familiar folks with a good understanding of the network’s data structures, a big drawback that currently exists on Mercury is the inability to test the programs against meaningful data for your testing flows. To this purpose we will create a testing studio, both on the mercury dashboard and as helpers in the Zephyr SDK. You will have the possibility of simulating calls to an existing contract or load test snapshots from your contract’s tests. Our sdk will do the heavy lifting to construct and translate the tests/execution results into ledgerclose metas and you’ll be able to test Zephyr out, at least for what regards Soroban interactions. Besides being able to test Zephyr programs against real/tweaked data, the testing studio is also meant for users and developers to test Soroban itself, always with data-centered applications:

Snapshot the network entries you’re interested in within your Soroban rust tests through our SDK. This is particularly useful for contracts that are relying on other contracts in their workflows. For example, for testing out flash loans or oracle contracts without having to install and build them and by relying on real protocol data.

From the dashboard, save and manage checkpoints of the ledger state you’re interested into to replay them either in soroban tests or Zephyr programs.

From the dashboard, interact with on-chain contracts without actually submitting transactions (a gadget that can be potentially embedded also by dapps for witnessing and visualizing actual effects of the transaction without submitting it).

Again, this non-zephyr part of the testing studio is specifically designed for Soroban applications that are relying on other contracts, so besides the testing ease of trying out your code interacting with real chain data within your cargo tests (which is cool, but unit testing for production protocols should generally also rely on a “blank” or no-state version of the chain, i.e the tests-only snapshots), it’s perfect for things like arbitraging contracts, flash loan liquidation contracts, etc which will generally also need to index data off-chain to trigger execution. We don’t aim to provide a full testing framework for Soroban, but rather to provide our clients (or whoever needs to index data) with the best experience possible given the resources we have already available from the other features of the environment.

Dashboard

The dashboard is the UI that enables access to all of the features offered by Mercury, while also helping customers manage data subscriptions, Zephyr activity, simulation and testing under named projects. Similarly to Web2 developer-oriented services, the dashboard would serve the purpose of creating projects and managing all of the components. The dashboard in Mercury also has the purpose of highly lowering the entry barrier required for working with Mercury. For example, developers will be able to rely on our Subscriptions Builder: this will be integrated with the Mercury Transaction Simulator, so users will be able to simulate transactions from our dashboard (or they will also able to import test snapshots from your Soroban rust tests) and display all emitted events and changed/created entries, which you can click on to open a dialogue for creating subscriptions starting from that structure’s layout. The dashboard is also responsible for all the generated code snippets that we provide the users with to immediately get started into integrating Mercury’s indexing and transactions simulation, testament to the fact that we plan for indexing to be easy for all developers, even entry-level developers trying to test Soroban/Stellar.

Stellar's native Horizon service is a good service right now, but we envision that with the growth of the ecosystem it might become overcrowded and communities may want to have their own Horizon-as-a-service node. When it comes to RPC nodes, based on our research, the majority of the current RPC providers are bigger companies not necessarily targeting startups/SMBs with their pricing - https://developers.stellar.org/network/soroban-rpc/rpc-providers.

We believe that by building Forge natively for Soroban we will be able to better coordinate and suit our product offerings/price to the growing ecosystem of new startups. When it comes to the challenges of scalability and managing huge data that is being kicked out by the network, we will be using the following approach:

Horizon-as-a-service - We will be using the Enterprise n-Tier approach, where data will be ingested using redundant captive core instances. At the same time we will have several API servers running as those do not require much processing and storage themselves - data is stored in DB cluster - 1 API role instance for each client, also maybe transaction submission role if requested. Our plan is to have 1 database cluster and up to 5 API instances in the beginning. As we will be monitoring the system we may increase the number of API instances based on different metrics. In the future we plan to make a copy of the whole cluster not to have DB as the single point of failure - follow the Redundant Hot Backup schema - https://developers.stellar.org/network/horizon/admin-guide/scaling#redundant-hot-backup. That way we'll make the system more fail-safe and scalable.

Soroban RPC as a service - if a user wants to spin up Soroban RPC we can provide that service as well - we will create the same architecture - single scalable database and several Soroban RPC services to save storage and network resources.

For now the plan is to store 30 day history and then increase the history window gradually as more and more users use the service. We will be using a Load Balancer for serving user requests. We will be running a single (or maybe two, for redundancy measures) node as a public gateway of our infra and propagating data inside the infra for the Ingestion.

Copy-on-write and database sharding are interesting areas for us to explore. While this is not part of the submission, we will explore these technologies to see how difficult/efficient it will be to implement them. When it comes to infrastructure, after receiving a request to create a node for a new customer, our automation and orchestration tool (AOT) will connect to Cloud Provider API and request to create a dedicated virtual machine with predefined configuration (CPU, RAM, Storage). We can configure our AOT to interact and deploy nodes with different Cloud Providers including big ones like AWS/Azure/GoogleCloud and any small ones like Hetzner/Linode/Vultr, also it could interact with on-premise virtualization like VMware/Proxmox/Nutanix. We also can deploy nodes directly on different managed Kubernetes clusters in cloud or on-premise. For now, we choose to use dedicated and individual nodes for customers to have predefined and guaranteed performance, for start we think to provide nodes with 4 CPU / 8GB RAM.

We are also exploring an option to deploy our own bare metal infra in North America and Georgia (Eastern Europe) to optimize our cost base and offer a lower price to our clients.

Our target audience are startups. We believe that all the activation and community awards grantees are a perfect audience for us to outreach.

Such challenges can slow down development, deter developers from fully exploring the capabilities of Soroban, and thereby limit its adoption.

Soroban CLI GUI was born to address these challenges by providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) application that abstracts soroban-cli to simplify the process of developing Soroban smart contracts. It provided a point-and-click interface to reduce the learning curve and potential for manual errors associated with command-line interactions, thereby making Soroban more accessible to a wider audience of developers and users. After its initial release, it was well received by the developer community with 10+ stars, 25+ downloads, and positive feedback in two weeks.

Soroban CLI GUI now becomes SORA to reflect its broader scope and enhanced capabilities. Evolving into SORA, the tool transitions beyond merely a GUI for soroban-cli, embodying a comprehensive suite aimed at enriching the Soroban development journey. New features like the Events Page for real-time contract event monitoring, the Lab Page for delving into Soroban's experimental functionalities, and the AI Command Constructor for translating natural language into executable commands, SORA is redefining the ease of Soroban contract development. This evolution is further supported by a Soroban AI Assistant for on-demand guidance, a VS Code Helper Extension for integrated development workflows, and substantial user experience improvements, ensuring that SORA not only simplifies but also elevates the development of Soroban smart contracts.

This is the second submission of our project, following the approval of our initial proposal after a budget reduction, as we had applied with an idea rather than an MVP. Now, we present a fully functional project that has shown significant progress in development and user engagement, rebranded as SORA. With this submission, we are seeking its justified budget to further develop and enhance SORA's capabilities, ensuring continuous improvement and maintenance to become a demanded tool for Soroban smart contract development among developers.

Transactions on Sanctum are private by default, meaning the identities of the senders and recipients are unknown to the public and the amounts are also hidden. Moreover, the system targets regulatory compliance by implementing the following features:

- Blacklisting: When a user is blacklisted, say in response to a warrant or a known DeFi exploit, any transaction where that user is a sender or a recipient can be decrypted by an authorized party. That is, the law enforcement party is provided a decryption key for accessing all transactions involving that blacklisted user. The key is generated by a decentralized mechanism where, say, all parties in a committee approve the decryption request upon verifying the warrant. The access structure policy implemented by this committee is configurable -- for instance, any m out of n committee members can approve the request.
- Proof of Innocence: As the set of blacklisted addresses grows, any payment must additionally prove that the sender and recipient are not blacklisted users, based on the most recent database of blacklisted users. This so-called proof-of-innocence is zero-knowledge, thus providing anonymity.
- Anti-Money Laundering: Sanctum attempts to provide anti-money laundering (AML) by enforcing a privacy budget, wherein transactions remain fully private only until a certain cumulative threshold (say $10,000 a month) and any transaction that exceeds the threshold can be decrypted by an authorized party (e.g., a law enforcement party).
- Anonymous Credentials: Sanctum provides each user with a credential, which can be issued as a result of the KYC process. Sanctum works with the anon-creds system and is therefore agnostic of the identity provider. Sanctum verifies that a payment only occurs between users that have a valid credential, although the private attributes of the credential are never leaked.",,,https://github.com/zkbricks/,https://github.com/zkbricks/,,,,,,,,Rohit Sinha,,,,,

The current multisignature implementation with a threshold t does not scale well with the number of participants (maximum of 20) because t signatures need to be submitted on-chain and verified in consensus. If more than t signatures are submitted, the transaction fails. Besides that, the network knows which accounts signed the transaction, which is not good for privacy.

Our proposal solves these issues because the FROST protocol is done completely off-chain. It starts with a Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where a secret key is generated that no single participant knows of. Instead, the participants generate shares of that secret key, that they can later use to sign a transaction. This is done by using the Pedersen's variation of the Shamir's secret sharing scheme, which allows the participants to verify their shares and does not require a trusted dealer. Our solution is:
- More scalable and more performant: Only a single Ed25519 signature is submitted to the network and is independent of the number of signers.
- More flexible: The number of signers is flexible between a minimum threshold t and the total number of participants in the protocol n.
- More private: The output Ed25519 signature is indistinguishable from any other signature on the network, and the signers are not known because the signing protocol happens off-chain.",,,,,https://youtu.be/GDPLUTX7uds,,,,,,,"fiono11, fiono11 ",,,,,

One module to rule them all.

Taking advantage of NestJS's versatility, stellar-nest provides a pre-configurable module. This means that both users unrelated to the Stellar ecosystem and those aiming to accelerate their Node.js development will find a pleasant surprise when using stellar-nest.

Drawing on the best practices recommended in the Stellar documentation, this module will enable a quick start. However, it will remain fully customizable depending on the development needs and will adapt accordingly. For instance, initializing the module in 'TESTNET' mode would generate an instance of the serverService pointing to the testnet server, utilizing the appropriate Network Passphrase depending on the mode. Nevertheless, this doesn't compromise power; at any point, you can modify the server configuration directly from the module, and this configuration would be applied to the serverService (which is actually the extended Horizon.server class).

For example, upon creating accounts, you could establish an initial trustline or choose an initial balance, all according to business rules. All of this will be completely customizable from the module configuration.

One module to bring them all.

Although it could be useful for various use cases, one of the main objectives is to accelerate certain processes and introduce Stellar to non-blockchain developers. With this recommended default configuration, it would be easy for them to integrate Stellar into their projects even if they are not directly related to blockchain.

In the land of development, where magic meets code, stellar-nest proposes working based on use cases, making it more intuitive to choose the utility to use depending on the circumstance. Leveraging the magic of TypeScript and Nest, a series of decorators, pipes, and additional functionalities are being prepared.

An easy example would be the balance decorator @BalanceParam(). For instance, a startup's service may want to retrieve the balance of an account based on a parameter, body, or formData when a controller is used, without needing to adapt the logic to fetch balances. @BalanceParam allows specifying the parameter name, along with additional configuration such as specifying the asset_code to know the exact balance of that account, thus enabling early return if a certain condition is not met, even before executing other logics.",,,https://github.com/Alkeops/It-s-not-another-package,https://github.com/Alkeops/It-s-not-another-package,https://www.loom.com/share/012bc2546b584d8c8d1c30f37cdbeefc?sid=b20238a9-cbb0-4122-a810-d26231cf2fb4,,,,,,,"alkeops, alkeops ",,,,,

I as a developer who already have a couple of contracts in Futurenet, Testnet, and Mainnet where each one of them has different accounts, different keys, different numbers, variables, and a big etc have faced this exact same problem and I'm 100% sure many more will face it in the future because the more the network grows, the more contracts will need to be managed.

So, here comes SorobanHub. SorobanHub is a single desktop app that serves as your control center and it allows you to keep everything organized in a single place. If you're like us that we need to manage SorobanDomains, WenMeridian, and FxDAOs contracts on different networks at the same time, you will find that using command line files can get messy pretty quickly.

SorobanHub is not just an ""extension"" of the Soroban CLI, instead, it is an app that uses different tools available like the Soroban CLI, the Stellar SDK, and others to make the management tasks easier. From simple things like checking the expiration date of key values on your contracts to more complex stuff like upgrading your contracts and executing them directly from the interface.

And because we know this is a tool that could add a lot of value to the ecosystem, we believe it should be free to use to all developers on the network so that's why it will be a free to download and use desktop app.",,,,,,,,,,,,Enrique A.,,,,,

The campaign's 88 varied content pieces, including long format videos, 100-second videos, written articles, and X posts, aim to educate on programmable money, blockchain, and fiat-crypto integration. With a target of 450,000 to 900,000 views, it aims to boost Soroban's adoption in fintech.

What the problem it solves, how it solves them, and what audience it solves them for:

This content campaign about Stellar and Soroban addresses two issues that, in my opinion, exist within Stellar: low presence on social media and lack of awareness about Soroban. To increase visibility, we would implement a strategy combining short vertical videos, long horizontal videos, stories, web articles, and posts on X for over 160,000 crypto-enthusiast followers. This campaign is dedicated to the Spain and LATAM community. Stellar has limited presence in these regions. However, with a reach of over 600,000 views, this community will engage more with the ecosystem, using XLM, creating wallets, and exploring Soroban's DeFi.

Our project is founded on the belief that access to a secure and stable digital economy is a universal right. Through an innovative solution based on Stellar, we enable merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments via QR codes, offering consumers the freedom to use their cryptocurrencies for daily transactions without fear of devaluation, paving the way for real and effective financial inclusion.

In the context of economies with high inflation rates, citizens are in a constant struggle to preserve the value of their money. The volatility of cryptocurrencies, combined with high conversion costs to FIAT currency and the complexity of their use, represents significant barriers. Our solution lies in a system that allows businesses to accept cryptocurrencies without altering their usual operations, and for consumers to spend their cryptocurrencies directly and safely. This approach not only protects the value of their assets but also simplifies the conversion process, removing obstacles to a more stable and dignified financial life. With the integration of Stellar Anchors, we offer a direct option to convert cryptocurrencies to FIAT, facilitating access to funds in bank accounts and promoting greater financial inclusion.

Our initiative stands out for launching a pioneering payment platform that builds bridges between the world of cryptocurrencies and the real economy, focusing especially on areas hit by inflation. By using the Stellar network, known for its efficiency in carrying out fast transactions with minimal costs, we make it possible for people to use cryptocurrencies for their everyday payments, thus avoiding high fees and complicated conversion processes that usually discourage their use. For merchants, our solution represents the removal of technical obstacles that traditionally have prevented the acceptance of crypto payments. This translates into the opening of new business avenues, accessible without the need to make additional investments in infrastructure or specialized training. The integration with Stellar Anchors underlines our innovation, enabling efficient conversion to FIAT and ensuring that merchants can easily manage their cryptocurrency revenues, paving the way toward true financial inclusion. Our approach not only contributes to strengthening the Stellar ecosystem but also serves as a vehicle for financial inclusion and economic stability, offering communities affected by inflation a valuable tool to protect their assets and participate in the global economy more securely and efficiently.

Our solution will be developed on a robust architecture in AWS, using services such as Lambda for serverless processing, DynamoDB or MySQL for data storage, SNS for event notification, and SQS for message queue management. This setup ensures scalability and efficiency. Moreover, we will employ API Gateway to securely expose our API. Regarding the technical use of Stellar, we will focus on implementing the SEP-007 protocol to manage payment requests, which will facilitate direct transactions between consumers and merchants without the need for pre-signed transactions, thus optimizing user experience and transaction security. Additionally, we will integrate with Stellar Anchors, allowing merchants to convert cryptocurrencies to FIAT and access their funds directly in their bank accounts, if they choose. This integration expands our solution, offering greater flexibility and supporting financial inclusion by connecting the world of cryptocurrencies with the traditional economy.",,,https://depayapp.com/,,,,,,,,,"Joaquin Fagalde, Marcelo Sanchez",,,,,

Targeted at individuals seeking, fun and education.","The Dogstar League is a feature included in the Dogstar app, a DeFi platform that unites the best of trading and online gaming.

The Dogstar League is a game where any user can participate, and the best gamers can build up their reputation while newbies can play and learn without any risk. It is not a demo! To do this, you just have to open a Dogwallet and create your profile. The goal of the game is to generate profits with the tokens that the sponsor gives to users at the start of the round and to reach the best position on the leaderboard to enter the prize zone. Profits and prizes will be distributed to your DogWallet at the end of the round. To generate profit and improve your position on the leaderboard, players must put their trading and investment strategies into practice.

The playground will be real on the Stellar blockchain, and players will be able to hold, trade (buy and sell), swap, and add liquidity. At your disposal, you will have charts with their tools courtesy of TradingView, as well as some charts with all the information on each asset, pair, and liquidity pool available. The DL is divided into 5-day rounds. A countdown will indicate the beginning and end of each round. At the start of the round, Dogstar will distribute the same amount of sponsor tokens equally to all players. We will call this initial: Sponsored Token. At the end of the round, the player with the most Sponsored Tokens wins.

The new game phase: MyLab completes the Dogstar League with new applications for players. Applications built in Soroban and whose main core is the use of the in-game asset: Terry. Terry are the points (like the gems in the game Clash Royale or the wood in Age of Empires) that a player can obtain by participating in a round of the Dogstar League. A player's Terry are not transferable to another player or user of the Stellar blockchain. In this way, players will discover how to enhance their performance with basic functionalities, expanding the gameplay of the Dogstar League and its strategic component. Players will now be able to use their Terry to swap cards, burn Terry, stack Terry, and lend & borrow Terry.

Problems:
- Tech barriers to initiate in the Crypto and DeFi world
- Lack of financial education
- Fear of losing money
- Soroban is a new kid on the block

Solutions:
- A platform that offers a complete experience to start using all DeFi tools that anyone can find on the blockchain.
- A game where players can practice DeFi with no risk of losing money while they learn and have fun.
- MyLab phase will be open-source, enabling a new resource to help devs onboard Soroban.

We have realized that we are building something unique, a project on Stellar & Soroban which will have long-term value to end users or other devs building on Stellar/Soroban. The first game that will mix real trading and in-game achievements controlled by smart contracts.

The game is inspired by MMORTS games from the early 21st century (Massively Multiplayer Online Real-Time Strategy Video Game), such as Utopia-game, Ogame, Travian, or ZeroG Commander games that inspired the founders of the Dogstar League during their youth. These games promoted financial education through mathematical calculations necessary to develop an acceptable strategy. Games that aroused the emotions of millions of online players and that we think today, by applying the right ingredients, can once again occupy a mass entertainment space.

These ingredients are:
- Decentralized Ownership of Assets: Utilize blockchain to give players true ownership of in-game assets.
- True Scarcity and Limited Edition Items: Leverage blockchain's ability to create true scarcity by limiting the number of certain in-game items or units. Introduce limited edition items or rare resources that can be traded for high token values.
- Provably Fair Gameplay: Use blockchain to implement provably fair gameplay, ensuring transparency and trust in the game's mechanics. This can include smart contracts for random number generation and ensuring that all actions are verifiable on the blockchain.
- Community-driven Development: Engage the community through decentralized funding mechanisms like token sales or crowdfunding using smart contracts. Allow players to invest in the game's development and share in its success.
- Player-Driven Economy: Create a player-driven economy where in-game markets and prices are determined by player actions and interactions, allowing for dynamic economic systems.
- Blockchain-based Achievements and Leaderboards: Implement achievements and leaderboards using blockchain technology, ensuring that accomplishments are recorded transparently and can be verified by other players.
- Cards for Unique Units or Heroes: Introduce non-transferable cards for unique units, heroes, or special items. These could have special abilities or attributes.
- Privacy and Security: Prioritize privacy and security by utilizing blockchain's encryption features. Ensure that player data is protected, and transactions are secure.
- Environmental Considerations: Minimize environmental impact by using the Stellar network and Soroban.

Our game, The Dogstar League, is your game. The next phase of the game will expand the user base since it is more oriented to gamers and at the same time to developers, as they will be able to experiment with a UI in an entertaining way while they can consult the open source of simple protocols built in Soroban. Without a doubt, a lasting and sustainable contribution to the community.

This phase will be accessed from a new button in the header that we will call MY LAB. We already have more than 12 sponsors who are going to donate money so the Stellar community and many more can play in a real environment, with real money but without risking their own.

For this goal, we will extend our Perun State Channel infrastructure that we have developed during SCF #14. The overview for the completed SCF #14 Grant can be found here. Upon completing the Grant, Stellar and Ethereum users will be able to swap assets between Stellar and Ethereum, using our Perun X dApp. The dApp currently allows end-users to exchange assets between Ethereum chains and is currently deployed on Mainnet on Ethereum and iExec’s Bellecour. It will be extended to include cross-chain swaps for other blockchains as well, such as Polkadot, Internet Computer, Cardano, Cosmos and Nervos for which we have already developed the technical foundation. The diagram below shows our PerunX architecture. The users will be able to request swaps via the Perun X frontend, and deploy the exchanged asset into a liquidity pool on the source chain. On the target chain, the desired asset from the target chain will be withdrawn from a liquidity pool. This product will have a significant impact on the Stellar ecosystem, as it provides a direct gateway between both chain ecosystems with a seamless user interface. Our exchange infrastructure utilizes liquidity pools. Thus, the swapped asset is deposited into a pool on the source chain, and the received asset is withdrawn from another liquidity pool on the target chain. Sustainable revenue can be achieved by charging a fee for the cross-chain swap service. Our liquidity pool infrastructure can be extended by DeFi-based building blocks. This allows us to incentivize liquidity providers to earn exchange fees from cross-chain swaps. Therefore, we believe that our platform will facilitate growth of the DeFi segment within the Stellar ecosystem. To allow cross-chain swaps between Stellar and Ethereum, we will adapt the cryptography components within the Stellar payment channel infrastructure (on-chain and off-chain) to comply with the ones used for Ethereum payment channels. Also, our core Perun module currently has only support for channels between same-type blockchains (i.e. Mainchain and sidechain). Therefore it has to be extended to support swaps between two different types of chains (i.e. Ethereum and Stellar). Our exchange platform has to be extended to support exchange requests from Stellar users. The frontend will be extended to use the Freighter Web Wallet to sign Stellar transactions.

Our platform will leverage Stellar and Soroban to deliver three key services: Crypto Will, Wallet Monitoring, and Asset Recovery Smart Contract Technology. Each service is tailored to ensure users' digital assets are securely managed, transferred, and accessible to designated beneficiaries under predefined conditions.

Crypto Will: This service allows users to create digital wills for their crypto assets, ensuring their assets are distributed according to their wishes. Utilizing Soroban smart contracts, the Crypto Will automates the execution of these wishes, providing a seamless transition of assets without the need for traditional legal intervention.

Asset Recovery Technology: This cutting-edge technology provides a secure and automated process for recovering and transferring assets from inactive or otherwise inaccessible wallets to beneficiaries. It ensures that even in unforeseen circumstances, users' digital legacies are preserved and passed on as intended.

Wallet Monitoring: Our Wallet Monitoring solution continuously tracks the activity status of a user’s crypto wallet. It is designed to detect significant changes or prolonged inactivity, triggering predefined protocols to safeguard the assets and alert designated contacts or beneficiaries.

These services will collectively utilize Stellar for their transactional backbone, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost transfers of digital assets. Soroban's smart contract capabilities enable the automation of will execution and asset recovery, making the entire process transparent and tamper-proof.

By integrating these technologies, Legacy Suite addresses the critical need for a comprehensive estate planning solution in the digital age, ensuring users' digital legacies are managed with the same care and precision as their physical ones.",,,https://www.legacysuite.com/,https://github.com/Avento-Labs/legacy-suite-contracts,https://youtu.be/CmSHpAfSVV4?si=hMlD2zrGkSUbudz2,,,,,,,Sean Foote,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/legacysuite/,https://twitter.com/legacy_suite,https://discord.com/invite/Ne6DefZNt6,
Kwickbit,SCF #24,Kwickbit: Corp DeFi Accounting,Kwickbit,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recrcyLc9CBiDZ8Ev,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$80000.00,$80000.00,597849.23,3/15/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"Enhance DeFi accounting with full transaction history, reconciliation, financial reports via UI/API, expand protocol integration","KwickBit is a financial management platform designed for businesses and accountants engaging with Stellar and Soroban protocols. It aims to significantly boost corporate adoption and utilization of the Stellar blockchain and Soroban DeFi ecosystem. Recognizing that adoption hinges on providing essential tools for businesses to operate entirely within the crypto sphere, KwickBit develops solutions that make it practical for companies to manage their finances using cryptocurrency rather than defaulting to fiat conversion.

Most businesses currently convert cryptocurrency into fiat to cover expenses due to the lack of comprehensive crypto-based accounting systems. Our goal is to enable companies to operate with cryptocurrencies like Stellar and Soroban tokens from end-to-end. This requires not only the ability to pay for services and goods in crypto but also to integrate these transactions seamlessly into their financial systems, ensuring they are properly accounted for in the company's chart of accounts and broader financial tracking.

Integration with Soroban Financial Protocols: A platform feature designed to seamlessly integrate with Soroban's financial protocols, such as Soroswap and Mozartpay, facilitating a comprehensive view of blockchain financial activities. Businesses require detailed insights into their transactions across different financial protocols to make informed decisions. Our platform integrates these protocols, providing essential data for financial analysis and planning. By interfacing with Soroban protocols, our tool aggregates transaction data, offering businesses a centralized dashboard to monitor and analyze their blockchain financial activities.

Crypto Reconciliation System: A reconciliation system that mirrors the functionality of traditional accounting software like QuickBooks, adapted for cryptocurrency transactions. Reconciling crypto transactions with company records is crucial for accurate financial reporting. Our system enables this process, ensuring compliance and financial integrity. Similar to the reconciliation process in QuickBooks, where bank transactions are matched with ledger entries, our platform allows businesses to match crypto transactions against their recorded activities, ensuring that every transaction is accurately accounted for and reflected in the financial statements. Example of traditional fiat-based reconciliation process using Xero (alternative to QuickBooks): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMD90xN_00. We plan to implement a similar process within KwickBit for Stellar/Soroban transactions.

Integration with NowNodes for Historical Transactions: Integration with NowNodes to fetch complete historical transactions for any address, overcoming the limitations of current indexers. The current indexer's limitation to only index transactions at subscription time has hindered our ability to provide comprehensive historical data. By integrating NowNodes, we can bypass these limitations, ensuring our platform can retrieve full transaction histories without timeouts, crucial for accurate financial tracking and reporting. Adapting our pipelines to utilize NowNodes allows us to efficiently fetch complete historical transactions for an address. This integration ensures our platform can handle extensive data retrieval tasks, essential for users.

Financial Reporting Module: A reporting module that automates the generation of financial reports on realized and unrealized profits, catering to compliance requirements. Reporting realized and unrealized gains is a compliance necessity for companies. This feature is essential for a complete financial system, enabling businesses to meet tax and regulatory obligations. It accesses historical transaction data through Stellar and Soroban, applying financial principles to compute and report profits in a compliant manner.

API for Historical Data & Reports: An API service that allows businesses to access historical transaction data and financial reports programmatically. Businesses may require programmatic access to data for integration into their systems. Our API service facilitates this access, offering a flexible solution for data retrieval. Users create an API key within their account, enabling secure access to our platform's data. This allows businesses to integrate transaction data and financial reports directly into their own systems, improving efficiency and customization.

Fiat Currency Conversion Feature: A feature for real-time conversion of Stellar assets into domestic fiat currencies, supporting accurate financial assessment. Accurately valuing crypto assets in domestic currencies is essential for financial reporting and analysis. Our conversion feature uses methodologies inspired by stellar-expert to provide this capability. Leveraging the Stellar network's exchange data, we provide users with the equivalent value of their transactions in domestic fiat currencies. Without direct APIs like CoinGecko, we will use the stellar-expert's approach from https://github.com/stellar-expert/stellar-expert-explorer. We will offer an open-source example and an article to enable the community to access fiat conversion of assets in a programmatically accessible manner.

UX/UI Community Feedback Initiative: A project phase dedicated to gathering and implementing UX/UI feedback from the Stellar and Soroban user communities. For technology adoption, especially in complex areas like crypto finance, the user interface and experience must align with the needs of the community. This initiative ensures our platform is built around actual user requirements rather than assumptions. We will conduct surveys, interviews, and beta testing with community members and accountants familiar with Stellar and Soroban transactions. This feedback will guide the development of our platform, ensuring it is intuitive, efficient, and meets the practical needs of businesses operating in the crypto space.",,,https://kwickbit.com/,https://github.com/kwickbit,https://youtu.be/0MPis9u6FG4,,,,,,,Charles-Edouard LADARI,,,,,

It allows its users to create and deploy various types of tokens on Stellar in less than one minute. The application will support generic and security tokens and can be easily extended to support even more. It will use native digital assets on Stellar and tokens based on Soroban smart contracts. Registering or logging in is unnecessary as it is completely decentralized. Later, it is also planned to be open-source and allow everyone to host the application on their own servers.

What Problem it solves: Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization is one of the big trends in the blockchain industry and it is one of the best use cases which brings real benefits and advantages to its users. Cryptix (https://cryptix.ag/) and the Cryptix Tokenization (https://tokenlaunchpad.eu/) team already did several tokenization projects and have a clear focus on tokenizing Securities, e.g. tokenization of bonds or real estate (e.g. https://rocksolidestate.com/). Part of the Cryptix Group is Equito (https://equito.co/), a MiFID II licensed broker in Europe, which allows Cryptix to deliver full service for tokenization projects - from legal and organizational structure to prospectus creation to technical implementation and placing securities on a platform. The process of tokenizing RWA consists of several steps, including organizational changes, prospectus creation and many more, which are mostly independent from technology and the tokenization itself. The creation of the token itself is a quite simple and fast process, but it is still hard for users to experience tokens, learn how they work and try it (""play around with tokens""). The Stellar Tokenlaunchpad allows everyone to create a token and try the different functionalities. It is a great tool to showcase tokens and can also be used to train users on how to work with tokens. This token creation can basically be done with various tools (e.g. laboratory, cli), but existing tools are often too complicated for users. Therefore, an easy-to-use application will help users to try and test tokenization and also to use it for the deployment of the real token on the mainnet. The platform will be available at stellar.tokenlaunchpad.eu and will later on be published as open source on github so that it can also be modified by everyone. It will also be possible to add additional token types, such as a ""Proof-of-Attendance"" Token, a course certificate or any other asset. Besides being open source, it will also be possible to self-host it through the prepared docker images. In addition to the Stellar Tokenlaunchpad, there will be various information for users to learn more about tokenization and get information about the tokenization of securities, including webinars and workshops. This content creation is already ongoing and information is published on the website https://tokenlaunchpad.eu/

Summarizing, the main goals of the Stellar Tokenlaunchpad are: Give users a super simple (non-authenticated, no-registration needed) tool to create and deploy various types of tokens (generic and security) on Stellar. Learn and experience Tokens on Testnet and Public (mainnet). Add other token types by extending the source (e.g. a ""Proof-of-Attendance"" token, an NFT, ...).",,,https://tokenlaunchpad.eu/,https://github.com/CryptixAG/Tokenlaunchpad,https://youtu.be/xPnFA5_pF1A,,,,,,,Armin Reiter,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cryptix-ag/,,,

Additionally, WageLink offers an array of features that caters to the evolving needs of today’s workforce. Key features include: (1) mobile payment capabilities that enable employees to make transactions directly from their phones, and (2) budgeting tools to empower individuals to track their expenses and saving goals. Over 62% of Americans today live paycheck to paycheck, and 4.5% are unbanked. WageLink aims to provide viable and accessible financial tools for Americans to access their hard-earned wages to be able to focus on being more productive at work instead of worrying about financial troubles. The WageLink app is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for everyone, no matter how tech savvy, to access and keep track of their wages, expenses, and spending habits.

WageLink is looking to launch an Earned-Wage-Access product which is going to allow the mass adoption of the app through early access of payroll for the employees.

Value for the ecosystem

Platform synergy: The dashboard is engineered to synergize with Soroban's native smart contracts platform, utilizing its robust and scalable framework to deliver real-time risk assessments.

Data-driven insights: Our infrastructure processes vast datasets to provide accurate risk scores directly on the dashboard.

Direct benefits for Soroban

Attracting liquidity: The dashboard enhances the attractiveness of Soroban's ecosystem for liquidity providers due to increased risk management.

Builders empowerment: Equipping both developers and users with the necessary risk tooling to deploy risk assessed strategies and contracts.

Ecosystem health monitoring: The dashboard acts as a barometer for the health of the Soroban ecosystem, allowing to know where the liquidity/risk is exposed in real-time.

What we propose to build for SCF

Alterscope aims to craft a real-time risk overview within Soroban's growing ecosystem, highlighting dApp-specific risks. Our vision is to integrate as a core risk assessment layer, offering developers, strategists, and users easy access to detailed data on protocols, liquidity pools, or new DeFi derivative stacks. We propose to build a community dashboard for SCF to facilitate end users to research dAps and to perform due diligence on on-chain/off-chain related parameters, ranging from liquidity to security metrics. Thereby, we provide a clear look at dApps in the Soroban ecosystem, helping improve projects and attract and retain liquidity in the ecosystem.

Inspiration

“Know Your Protocol"" (KYP) is a concept we have developed to emphasize the importance of understanding the intricacies of dApps. Drawing inspiration from the financial sector's ""Know Your Customer"" principle, KYP allows a comprehensive research of protocols. We propose using ""Know Your Protocol"" as the name for a dedicated tab, reflecting our commitment to offering users in-depth insights into the Soroban ecosystem.

Figure: Illustration of how a community dashboard on dApps could be embedded on the webpage of Stellar.

The ""Know Your Protocol"" links to a DYOR community dashboard to assess dApp-specific risks metrics. We suggest the personalized Soroban domain (https://solity.community/Soroban). Below you see an illustration of our current UI design with an overview of integrated dApps in our solution.

Figure: Illustration of frontend design for the overview of integrated dApps. We'll provide a high-level overview in a table format, comparing dApps based on predefined risk frameworks, as highlighted in the illustration below.

Figure: Illustration of an UI for the summary of protocol risks in table format (scores here only illustrative). Upon clicking on a protocol, users can delve deeper into its subcategories, such as the detailed breakdown of audit data. This approach allows for a more granular view of each protocol's risk profile while preventing information overload on the initial risk screen, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Figure: Illustration of the audit section for a selected protocol.

dApp risk categories

We are working on various major risk categories to analyze risks and facilitate users' analysis of risks. Currently, we cover the following dApp-specific risk dimensions:

Category Metric/Aspect Description

Data acquisition and processing

Our high-level design system streamlines a multi-faceted public data ingestion process, differentiated in on- and off-chain data sources. Regarding, on-chain data we run our own nodes and build proprietary ETL pipeline to ensure a high accuracy and latency of data (e.g., Liquidity Risk Data). Regarding off-chain data, we built our own data pipeline infrastructure for being able to continuously gather and process relevant data (e.g., Development Activity Data from GitHub). To ensure data integrity, we run stress tests on our infrastructure and establish quality processes. Since data in our risk modules are public, dApps don’t need to opt in for realizing our solution. Standards have not yet been established for analyzing technical-fundamental risks associated with dApps and today’s risk scores lack the ability to provide objective evaluation criteria. For this reason, we emphasize transparency on how the risk scores are calculated and offer the Stellar/Soroban team to adapt the evaluation criteria according to their preferences.

Architecture diagram

The system architecture is designed to enable efficient data processing, ingestion, and management, integrating machine and deep learning capabilities with high speed data storage. The data processing utilizes Kafka for stream processing, coupled with a ML engine for risk processing, and employs an ETL process for data treatment. The system incorporates APIs to harness off-chain data from various sources, including GitHub and social media, and utilizes web crawlers for real-time data acquisition. Storage solutions are diversified, featuring for example MongoDB for structured risk parameters, ensuring robust data persistence and retrieval. The AWS is orchestrated via Kubernetes, utilizing EBS for scalaling. The frontend is made with React.js libraries to render the data in an intuitive dashboard, interfacing with the OAuth2 service for secure user authentication. Please see the attached Technical Architecture Doc.

EnerDAO,SCF #24,EnerDAO - DeFi for Renewables,EnerDAO,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recxI1WH8tFYnAwag,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$47700.00,$47700.00,340296.20,3/7/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,EnerDAO: Fuelling the Global Green Transition through Decentralized Finance and tokenization of renewable power projects debt.,"EnerDAO is a groundbreaking DeFi platform with a singular focus on expediting the worldwide shift to renewable energy. By fusing decentralized finance with the latent potential of small to medium-sized renewable projects, we democratize investment opportunities and dismantle barriers to green energy financing.

Renewable energy initiatives face a critical funding bottleneck, particularly smaller ventures. Exorbitant financing costs and cumbersome traditional models hinder these projects from taking off. We stress on the untapped need from the energy projects to be financed. However, we should also highlight the market perspective and green energy demand-supply gap that shows scalable opportunity and potential interest from investors. Moreover, EnerDAO is building instruments for digital asset investors that will provide them with more safety and predictability in terms of asset integrity and real yield generation.

We tackle this issue by harnessing the power of blockchain and tokenization. Our platform establishes a robust and transparent ecosystem that simplifies investments, mitigates risks, and leaves a positive impact on the environment. EnerDAO streamlines renewable energy financing, delivering tangible benefits to both investors and project developers seeking funding.

Activation award PoC - With the first Activation award we plan to develop the required basic flow and underlying smart contracts. We will use the developed PoC to engage with our internal and external stakeholders, i.e. energy companies, consulting firms, and financial organizations, to test the underlying hypothesis of EnerDAO`s process flow and receive feedback. These companies have already agreed to engage when the PoC will be ready.

Further development into an MVP - after building the basics, we plan to extend our work on other core features for such a platform that will help automate processes and build up the foundation of the final product, while testing every milestone against incumbent market participants from our network. The goal of the MVP is to have the technical solution ready while we configure the legal structure and financial product under it.

We plan to incorporate feedback from the initial PoC and MVP phases into further development.

EnerDAO will utilize the Stellar blockchain to facilitate transactions on the platform in EURC stablecoins. These stablecoins are pivotal for the European market, eliminating currency risks for both lenders and borrowers. The use of EURC stablecoins simplifies the investment and lending processes, allowing both parties to focus on generating real and fair yields. Additionally, it aids in determining loan conditions benchmarked against traditional local and national financing schemes.

Building such a project on Stellar and Using Soroban for smart contracts will enhance Stellar's motto of being the blockchain for the real world. We are confident that EnerDAO`s vision to merge decentralized finance with decentralized energy sources will help both worlds accelerate and grow. Further decentralized governance of such a platform will allow for active engagement of platform users and ownership of the instruments that will fuel the green transition while bringing real yield and business sense.

Projects on EnerDAO will use the Stellar Blockchain to tokenize their debt and bonds while employing Soroban smart contracts to specify loan terms and allocate tokenized debt and collateral to a network of distributed lenders. Each Borrower project will establish financing pools to facilitate investment from Lenders. Smart contracts will guarantee the equitable distribution of returns among the lenders within the pool. Blockchain technology enables the creation of a secondary market for these investment instruments, providing digital asset investors with diversified cash flows backed by physical power generation assets behind the tokenized borrower equity.

The beauty and the challenge of creating such an instrument is in the long tenure of such loans. While it might be not that interesting for the majority of current cryptocurrency users, such bonds, or tokenized best position tokens, when traded on the secondary market, will become a great hedge from purely digital assets volatility, guaranteeing a stable real yield as it will be generated from the operations of the underlying asset in the traditional and rapidly growing energy markets. All lending pool tokens will have an individual vesting schedule and once vesting is completed they can be redeemable. During the vesting schedule token holders can stake and receive rewards (LP tokens) that are redeemable anytime on the secondary market. To start off we're going to do tokenization through a 3rd party in Europe, right now in talks with Fireblocks and a few more. In the later stage, we will do tokenization ourselves on the platform with a built-in tokenization module and appropriate legal structure to support the process.

Furthermore, EnerDAO's integration with Stellar presents multiple use cases in the current banking system, including potential adoption by crypto-friendly banks, and other TradFi financial institutions using Stellar for diversification of their digital asset portfolio or for backing their stablecoins with tokenized collateral in EUR.

As a team, EnerDAO has already engaged with multiple renewable energy developers and received interest in such a platform from them. We will leverage this engagement to execute mock deals on the platform and gather feedback before moving beyond MVP. Today we have up to 200 mln in active interest from potential borrowers within Europe developing such projects as grid-scale solar power plants, wind power plants, battery energy storage facilities, renewable hydrogen projects, and EV charging station networks.

We have also established contact with such companies as BCG, Deloitte, and BloombergNEF to invite them to test the platform features and potentially become contributors to the platform's tasks of executing project due diligence before listing and spreading this option for raising capital among their clients from the target market. Moreover, we plan to pitch the platform at specialized energy and blockchain events promoting our work with Stellar and inviting new users to the platform. The initial liquidity will come from the strategic investment round that we're going to conduct once we have the MVP and complete the grant with Stellar. On top of that, we're going to work with the market maker - Flow Traders.

Benefits for Investors and Lenders:
Diversified Portfolio: Access a range of renewable energy projects.
Structured Investments: Directly fund specific projects of interest.
Risk Management: Benefit from robust due diligence and smart contracts.
Liquidity: Trade tokens for liquidity and price discovery.
Governance: Participate in decision-making through token-based voting.

Benefits for Borrowers (Project Developers):
Easy Funding: Bypass traditional finance hurdles.
Competitive Rates: Access lower-cost capital through global investors.
Transparent Terms: Clear listing of loan terms and rates.
Community Validation: Gain credibility from community vetting.
Asset Tokenization: Simplify asset management via digital tokens.

EnerDAO intends to generate revenue through spreads between borrower interest rates and returns paid to investors, along with platform fees for additional services. The formal legal structure will be established following the successful deployment and validation of our MVP. The legal structure will receive all required licenses and will operate in a compliant manner, also acting as the platforms back-end for off-chain activities such as loan agreements, borrowers' collateral liquidation, and others.

By harnessing the potential of DeFi, EnerDAO not only simplifies investment in renewable energy projects but also propels the global transition to green energy forward.

Note: We should highlight that the scope of deliverables under the Activation Award does not represent the full MVP vision and covers the first needed steps to set the core of the project. Moreover, the key features of the platform, its functionality, and smart-contract configuration will be tailored to the market participants' needs based on the feedback we will receive from the abovementioned stakeholders that we plan to invite into the MVP and test the platform on a test net version. So far, a number of borrowers and potential lenders have expressed interest in such an exercise.",,,https://www.enerdao.org/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlVN5_FOBvA,,,,,,,Andrii Bondar,,,https://x.com/ener_dao,,
Solarkraft,SCF #24,Solarkraft: runtime monitoring,Solarkraft,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec05ielYqgWQu4OH,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,390487.41,3/22/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Runtime monitoring of Soroban smart contracts to aid developers and auditors in finding critical bugs before and in production,"The product. Solarkraft is a tool for runtime monitoring of Soroban smart contracts. It tests whether a smart contract conforms to its specification during contract development, testing, and after contract deployment on the Stellar blockchain. The contract specification is written as an ensemble of TLA+ specifications, each capturing a property of the contract’s expected behavior. As an example, consider the timelock contract from the repository of Soroban examples:

Monitor 1 requires that “claim” is only called after “deposit”.
Monitor 2 requires that the deposited balance equals the submitted amount.
Monitor 3 requires that a claim can be made only by a claimant from the set of claimants that was passed earlier to the “deposit” method.
Monitor 4 requires that the funds may be claimed only within the time bound that was passed to the “deposit” method earlier.

Solarkraft inspects invocations of the timelock contract’s methods in the history of Stellar transactions. Whenever Solarkraft finds a deviation from the expected behavior (as prescribed by the monitor specifications) it reports a monitoring alert. For more details, check the document on Technical Architecture. Importantly, monitors are small snippets of code, not an entire specification. This makes them more accessible formal artifacts than usual.

The problem. Smart contracts are backing billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies. At the same time, smart contracts are notoriously difficult to get right. One reason for that is that the code of the smart contracts is immutable, that is, they cannot be quickly patched, once deployed on mainnet. In this sense, smart contracts are further away from Web 2 software, which can be patched on the spot, and closer to hardware, where a single bug may cost millions of dollars. Another reason is that smart contracts are often written using an agile framework, when the requirements are figured out on-the-go, often by writing unit tests and integration tests. As a result, the expected behavior is poorly documented, if at all.

Formal methods promise to deliver hard guarantees about correctness of software. Even though we observe that formal methods enjoy stronger adoption in Web 3 than in Web 2, the use of formal methods is still quite limited in the blockchain space. In our experience, there are several hurdles in adoption of formal methods:

The value of a formal specification is not clear, unless it is directly connected to the source code and tools understood by engineers.
Similar to code, engineers and researchers alike tend to write monolithic specifications that capture the entire contract behavior. As a result, the specification becomes as complex as the source code, just written in a specification language.

Consequently, the most common engineering practice looks as follows:

Engineers develop their contracts and write unit tests. Good engineering teams also write integration and end-to-end tests, and employ fuzzing or property-based testing.
At some point, the contracts are deployed to a testnet, where the users are asked to break them; it is essentially a manual process. Since the users are not intimately familiar with the expected contract behavior, they just guess the intuitive properties of the contracts.
After running the contracts on the testnet, the engineering team orders a security audit (sometimes, two or three), in which security experts try to break the contracts in all possible ways. Levels of expertise among auditing companies also vary greatly, and not being familiar with the contracts, the auditors are again trying to guess the core system properties to break.

As can be seen, the above practice is problematic in that it involves a lot of (incomplete) guessing, thus allowing critical bugs to sneak into production. Our goal is to connect and harden these activities via runtime monitoring using formal methods.

Our solution. To address the above-mentioned problems and strengthen current practices, we propose Solarkraft. In this project, we take into account our learnings from Atomkraft, the model-based testing tool that we developed for the Cosmos ecosystem in 2022, to develop the following novel and unique features:

We propose to write multiple monitor specifications for individual features, as opposite to a monolithic specification of the contract behavior. Individual monitor specifications are easier to write, read, and verify. Moreover, there is a good chance that some of these partial specifications may be reused across the contracts. For instance, a monitor that captures token transfer does not have to differ for different contracts.
We map contract values to specification values, which is known as “abstraction”. This will be easier and more natural to do than mapping specification values to contract values, which is known as “concretization”.
We integrate our monitoring tool into the development process. This brings immediate value to the engineers. Not only can they test their contracts and observe monitor alerts in the development stage, the monitors can still be run after the contract deployment.
Solarkraft will be of value to contract auditors too. Auditors often have a very tight time schedule for discovering security bugs. In our experience when auditing projects in the Cosmos ecosystem and participating in Code4rena competitions, it is quite challenging to write a complete specification that faithfully represents a collection of contracts (though we managed to do that in a few cases). With the approach outlined in this proposal, abnormal contract behavior can be discovered much faster, by writing simpler abstract monitor specifications.

Solarkraft is a tool on top of the Apalache model checker. Apalache is one of the two main model checking engines for TLA+, the specification language developed by Leslie Lamport, together with the model checker TLC. Unlike TLC, which is an explicit state model checker, Apalache is symbolic, thus allowing one to handle very large or unbounded data domains, and which scales on some industrial examples better than TLC. We have been developing Apalache since 2016: The project started at TU Wien (Austria), then continued at Inria Nancy (France), Interchain Foundation (Switzerland), and Informal Systems (Canada/Switzerland/Austria). Apalache has always been published under the Apache 2.0 license, making it the perfect platform to leverage and extend for Solarkraft.

When it comes to the question of developing a sustainable product, we believe that the easiest way to bootstrap Solarkraft is to use it in the security audits. In the future, our team could use Solakraft to audit Soroban contracts. Since Solarkraft will be open source, other auditing teams may get value out of it too. Also, engineers may see value in developing monitor specifications, leading to more robust smart contracts that are easier to develop, audit and verify.

On a technical side, we do not address the issue of generating inputs for the smart contracts. In the activation phase, we assume that this could be done either manually, or by employing a fuzzer (or a set of generators as used in property-based testing). In the future phase, we could automatically generate input values with Apalache, similar to how we did it with Atomkraft.

Finally, you may wonder why we propose to write monitors in TLA+ instead of Rust. There are several reasons:

Since we want an individual monitor to capture partial behavior of the contract, abstract transitions of a single monitor will be non-deterministic in most cases. TLA+ naturally expresses non-deterministic behavior, whereas Rust is deterministic by design.
If we proceed to input generation in the post-activation phases, it is much easier to solve symbolic constraints for a high-level specification language such as TLA+ than for a real implementation language such as Rust, which has to take care of every single execution detail including memory management.
In addition to that, we see value in the ability to analyze the behavior of the monitors with the model checker. For instance, we could check whether a monitor is never stuck, which would indicate a contradiction in the specification.",,,https://github.com/freespek/solarkraft,https://github.com/freespek/solarkraft,https://youtu.be/Ogdy4AHfMRA,,,,,,,"Thomas Pani, Igor Konnov, Andrey Kuprianov, Jure Kukovec",,,,,

To offer standardized, compatible services, Anchors must implement a whole series of Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. As an anchor, the most important SEPs are SEP-10: Stellar Authentication, SEP-12: KYC API, SEP-38: Anchor RFQ API, SEP-6: Programmatic Deposit and Withdrawal, SEP-24: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal, and SEP-31: Cross Border Payments API.

The open-source PHP Anchor SDK helps PHP developers to implement the Client - Anchor interaction by abstracting the Stellar-specific functionality defined in the SEPs. The SDK is composed of two components: a Service Layer Library implementing the Stellar specific functionality described in the corresponding SEPs, and an open-source Reference Server implementation that uses the library.

The library is published on packagist, the main PHP Packages Repository, and can be freely used in any PHP project. The Reference Server implementation serves as an example project, demonstrating the interaction with the library but can also be easily extended to implement the real business logic.",,,https://github.com/Argo-Navis-Dev/php-anchor-sdk,https://github.com/Argo-Navis-Dev/php-anchor-sdk,https://youtu.be/oZ04bL3wL-A,,,,,,,"Bence Nagy, Christian Rogobete",,,,,
Decentrio,SCF #24,Soroban RPC and indexer,Decentrio,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec38EACiEgZHpXzk,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,374868.79,3/21/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,We Decentrio propose to provide a reliable RPC service and make a highly functional transactions/events indexer for Soroban Dapp.,"Decentrio will provide highly available Soroban RPC endpoints, capable of scaling up to high loads. Leveraging our experience running highly available and secure infrastructure in Cosmos, we will provide access points to power Soroban developers and apps. This will include public RPC endpoints for testnet and futurenet, as well as paid plans for mainnet. Mainnet RPC usage will require a paid account, with a limited free tier offered to any Soroban Grant recipient. By leveraging advanced monitoring and load balancing over several Stellar Nodes, we can achieve 99.9% uptime. We will load-test the endpoints before going live to understand the machines needed to handle given loads (queries per second) and provide a sliding budget based on the needed scale.

Decentrio will offer very competitive pricing. We have experience running high-load nodes efficiently in the Cosmos space, by moving from AWS to more cost-efficient providers and tuning the machines properly. Block Eden pricing is $20/month for 20000 req/day, and we will offer a free tier at a similar amount, with paid tiers for those teams who need more requests.

While many other teams are porting existing GraphQL designs to Soroban, or exposing lots of raw data (no frontend developer wants to deal with base-64 XDR values), we will work with existing Soroban dApps to design a user-friendly API focused on their needs. This means we will start with specific endpoints that developers need and provide them in a clean, user-friendly format, along with sufficient documentation. And then add more powerful queries in a future round, once we have demonstrated we can provide a dev-friendly API for the common needs.

The indexer service will run alongside a separate Soroban node (not a public RPC endpoint), ingesting all the Soroban transactions and events into a PostgreSQL database. Notably, we will not focus on non-Soroban transactions, as there are already well-developed solutions for that (eg Stellar Horizon). We will provide a documented REST API to query contract events, filtering by contract IDs and topics. All infrastructure will be built in Golang, which enables the use of many Stellar/Soroban libraries, as well as many mature and efficient libraries to build APIs. Our team has deep experience in this language.

One key point is the translation of base64 XDR values to human-readable JSON. One can design a 1-to-1 mapping that allows XDR to be converted to unique JSON that can be converted back to the same XDR (needed when taking as input for the API). Things like the difference between encoding a symbol and a string must be exposed. Similar work has been done before in JavaScript, and we will borrow from that interface design.

The Alpha version of the product will include:

- Continuously running ingestor pushing Soroban data into a PostgreSQL database
- A tested XDR ↔ JSON conversion for ScVal, which includes all data and topics emitted from Contracts
- A documented API to query for transactions based on contract ID and topics, including pagination
- A publicly reachable endpoint for testnet and mainnet, so dApp developers can try it out and give feedback to help shape future APIs (no uptime, load guarantees)

Once this stage is successfully completed, we plan to apply for a Community Grant to build out further endpoints and queries needed by developers, as well as subscriptions/alerting and provide a more robust hosting infrastructure, along with a tiered subscription service based on usage and load.",,,https://decentrio.ventures/,,https://youtu.be/idHJxRxhhVA,,,,,,,"Nguyễn Duy Khánh, Nguyen Thinh Vuong",,,https://twitter.com/decentriolabs,,
JS Worker SDK,SCF #24,JS Worker SDK,JS Worker SDK,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recaEiyFpgJEc9TN2,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$12500.00,$12500.00,87045.53,3/13/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,The JS Worker SDK is a modern simple JavaScript SDK with a light &lt;10kB footprint that gives easy access to the Horizon API.,"The existing Stellar Javascript SDK is powerful and complete, however it is also very NodeJS-centric, adds 291kB of download weight to browser-based applications, and lacks perfect compatibility with modern JavaScript backends such as Browser Service Workers, Cloudflare Workers, Deno and WinterJS (which runs on Wasmer Edge).

The JS Worker SDK solves all three issues with a very lightweight SDK built on modern standards, with no dependencies. Its module lazy-loading design means that reading the Horizon API can be done with a 6.3kB browser download weight (before minification) and the use of only pure browser standards allows for drop-in compatibility for Service Workers, Cloudflare Workers, Deno and WinterJS.

Some quick examples of usage:

// include the SDK with a connection to the test network
import { horizon } from './horizon.js?network=test'

// grab a single page of 10 transaction records as an array
const setOfTenTransactions = await horizon.get.transactions()

// start listing out all transactions with automatic pagination
for await (const t of horizon.stream.transactions()) console.log(t)

// start an EventSource based listener to fire an event when new transactions are posted
const { listener: transactions } = await horizon.listen.transactions()
transactions.addEventListener('message', event => console.log(event.data))

JavaScript is arguably the most important language to have a modern SDK available for, as it is uniquely able to address both front and back end integrations. Front-end integrations especially require the option of a lightweight SDK for simpler use cases, as well as having unavoidable performance concerns which can deeply inform the choice of SDKs and tools.

This JS Worker SDK solves this problem, creating one lightweight, universally compatible and performant SDK for JavaScript applications.",,,https://github.com/Cloudouble/stellar-js-worker-sdk,https://github.com/Cloudouble/stellar-js-worker-sdk,https://youtu.be/28_VTNMFL4Q,,,,,,,"drpitman, drpitman ",,,,,

This enables organizations to easily spin up DAOs that support:

Stellar Asset Token Voting: Voting supports both custom Soroban tokens and Stellar classic tokens, while still preventing flash loan or other balance transfer voting exploits. This is achieved via checkpoints that have been optimized for Soroban.

Vote Delegation: Token holders of DAOs can delegate their votes to other parties, this feature is crucial to increasing voter participation through representative democracy.

Proposal Thresholds: DAOs can require proposal creators to have a certain amount of voting power in order to create a proposal - this is crucial to prevent proposal spam, which can result in malicious proposals slipping through the cracks.

Quorums: Quorums can be implemented to require a minimum percent of possible voters vote on a proposal in order for it to be implemented. This ensures that bad proposals do not succeed due to a lack of voter participation.

Minimum voting periods: Minimum voting periods are supported to ensure that every voter has a chance to vote on proposals.

Execution timelock: DAOs can support execution timelocks to ensure that users can respond to DAO proposals by removing money from protocols. This is vital for safe DAO managed DeFi protocols that allow users to effectively self custody.

Permissionless, arbitrary proposal execution: DAOs encode calldata execution instructions into the proposal, enabling DAOs to interact with the greater Soroban ecosystem. This means that once the proposal has passed a vote and the timelock has expired, any party may execute the proposed action (e.g. ""call swap on a USDC:XLM AMM contract"") using the DAO smart contract. This feature is mandatory for having decentralized DAOs as otherwise there is no guarantee that passed proposals will be executed.

Proposal security council (optional): DAOs can optionally specify a proposal security council address. If specified, the security council must approve any proposal created before it can be put up for voting. The council will not have the ability to cancel or stop the execution of a proposal after voting has begun.

There are minimal requirements to utilize a Soroban Governor DAO. A project needs to determine their parameter values, deploy the contracts, and initialize the governor with the parameters. From there, proposals can be submitted, voted on, and executed.

Soroban Governor UI

Soroban Governor will offer an open source UI to facilitate participation in Soroban Governor based DAOs. The open source UI will support features like:

DAO List: Script3 will be organizing a community run DAO list, where trusted contracts that implement the Governor and Voter trait can be used within the UI. If you would like to be involved in this - please reach out to any of the contacts on this proposal.

DAO Transparency: Inspect DAOs to view their configuration, including things like proposal lifecycles and security council details.

Proposal Creation: Allow users to create and submit proposals for the DAO.

Proposal Transparency: Allow users to view current and historical proposals, including their vote history, contents, and proposer description.

Voting: Allow users to vote on active proposals, view their voting balance, and interact with the Votes token.

Proposal Execution: Allow successful proposals to be executed by anybody after the proposal timelock has passed.

Open Source: Can be forked by any DAO for a more seamless, branded experience.

Soroban Governor SDK

A fully featured, open source Javascript SDK will be developed alongside the UI to enable any developers in the ecosystem to have more flexibility in interacting with Soroban Governor based DAOs. The SDK will facilitate data fetching of historical and current data for a Soroban Governor DAO like proposals and voting history. This will be achieved by creating a useful, indexed database off-chain to persist aggregate data via the ZephyrVM and Mercury. The off-chain database is a requirement for rich data as the Soroban Governor contracts store proposal data in temporary storage as a means to reduce fees, given proposals have a fixed lifecycle. Thus, old proposals need to be stored elsewhere to ensure they can be referenced by downstream applications in the future. The indexer will also be open source to ensure projects have visibility into the databases and/or can easily extend the code for their own uses. The SDK will support features like:

Fetch data for a Governor based DAO

Fetching past proposals and voting history

Fetching current proposals and voting status

Creating transactions for performing actions against a Governor contract

Creating transactions for performing actions against a Votes contract

Ecosystem

This project was inspired by the needs from the YieldBlox DAO - to have a Soroban based DAO contract that allowed voting with a Stellar Asset and enabled them to execute against Soroban contracts in a decentralized, safe manner. The current Soroban space, based on our research, did not meet these requirements.

Together with the TypeScript and Kotlin Wallet SDKs, the Flutter Wallet SDK is part of the Stellar Wallet SDKs family.

Almost half of the onboarding Wallets use Flutter as a programming language. Currently, most of them use our core Stellar Flutter SDK. With the new Flutter Wallet SDK, I would like to make it even easier for Flutter developers to implement Wallets and other Applications and allow easier integration with Anchors.

I started in the middle of 2023 to implement the Flutter Wallet SDK, reflecting important parts of the functionality provided by the TypeScript and Kotlin Wallet SDKs. I implemented the support for SEP-01, SEP-10, SEP-12, and SEP-24 on my own budget and received the SCF Activation Award in the SCF Round #22 for the implementation of SEP-30, SEP-38 support, and Wallet operations.

The Flutter Wallet SDK is documented in the official ""Build a Wallet with the Wallet SDK"" guide.

To reach the same level of functionality as the TypeScript Wallet SDKs provided by SDF, I want to extend the Flutter Wallet SDK to also implement Programmatic Deposit and Withdrawal (SEP-06) support, which has been recently added to the TypeScript Wallet SDK.

In addition, I would like to create a tutorial on how to build a payment app by using the Flutter Wallet SDK, similar to the official SDF tutorial for JS that can be found here. Like the official SDF tutorial, it should provide a sample Flutter app, which will be used to showcase the various features. My goal is to reflect the same level of features as in the SDF tutorial + sample app so that it can be added to the official Stellar docs page. To achieve this goal, the Flutter Wallet SDK will be extended to support path payments and data query functions.",,,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_wallet_flutter_sdk,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_wallet_flutter_sdk,https://youtu.be/k_IGwuu22Gs,,,,,,,Christian Rogobete,,,,,
LOAM,SCF #24,LOAM - Grow Ambitious Dapps,LOAM,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec3XoeMveOKOZzQS,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$140900.00,$140900.00,1263448.62,8/15/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Focus on the important parts of your Soroban Dapp. Let Loam handle the tedious bits.,"Loam is a development toolkit specifically designed to ease the construction of Dapps on Soroban. It streamlines the most challenging aspects of Dapp development, offering developers a clear path from concept to deployment.

The Problem: The complexity of building on smart contract platforms can be daunting, especially for those accustomed to traditional web development. The lack of intuitive tools for managing and integrating smart contracts adds to the challenge, hindering productivity and innovation. The Solution: Loam introduces a developer-friendly toolkit that includes a command-line interface (CLI) and a frontend framework. These tools simplify the creation, deployment, and integration of smart contracts, making the development process as straightforward as traditional web development.

The Benefits: Developers benefit from increased efficiency and clarity, allowing them to focus on the unique features of their Dapps. Loam's streamlined approach lowers the entry barrier to blockchain development, making Soroban's powerful capabilities accessible to a broader range of developers.

How It Works and Its Use of Soroban: Loam will have two main components: the loam-cli and the frontend template. Using either Loam's CLI or the upcoming soroban init command, you will be able to create a new project that comes pre-configured for straightforward productivity. It will all be designed to feel so simple that it doesn't really feel like anything: just a familiar npm run dev or the equivalent loam dev, and your React app runs in your browser, with the added benefit that any change to your contracts/* files will automatically rebuild, re-deploy or update deployed contracts, and regenerate the contract clients for use in the React code. The same configuration that powers this workflow for your own contracts will also make it as easy to use 3rd-party, already-deployed contracts as it is to use your own. Making this truly seamless will also require, in development and testing environments, getting contracts into an expected state. For your own contracts, this means running some initial setup, for example: funding accounts, initializing contracts, minting tokens. For 3rd-party, already-deployed contracts on which you rely in testnet and mainnet environments, Loam configuration + CLI will allow specifying which contract, which network, and which ledger sequence number to copy into your local environment during initialization.",,,https://loam.build ,https://github.com/loambuild ,,,,,,,,"Chad Ostrowski, Enzo Soyer",,,,,
Satellite + We Work Out,SCF #24,Satellite + We Work Out,Satellite + We Work Out,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recmo7OFBROky1vev,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$75250.00,$75250.00,547435.96,3/28/2024,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"A platform for deploying smart contracts linked to third partyapp data(first up, Strava). Like Zapier, but for Soroban.","Satellite is a developer platform that integrates third party app data into Soroban, acting as the gateway between software oracles and smart contracts. Leveraging webhooks, sockets, and polling, our platform receives live updates from user’s third party app accounts and passes the data into smart contracts. The platform is designed for Soroban developers - they upload WASM of a smart contract that implements the Satellite protocol, configure a 3rd party service, choose which event data to forward to their contracts, and Satellite handles the rest. By enabling a fully-customizable developer experience for integrating real time 3rd party app data into Soroban smart contracts, Satellite aims to bring real-world utility to smart contracts.

We Work Out is the first end-user application implementing the Satellite platform. Since the first third party software oracle that Satellite will implement is Strava, we will be building a web, iOS, and Android application that enables users to create workout pools. A workout pool is a group of people, or teams, who are either competing or working together to achieve fitness goals, and then receive payouts based on hitting those goals.

For example, a company wants to incentivize employees to walk more, so they create a workout pool with $10,000 that will pay out to all users in their company who walk more than 10 miles per week over the course of three months. Users who join the workout pool connect their Strava account, which automatically enables Satellite support for their workout data, which feeds directly into Soroban. Another example would be a running club that wants to pay out the athlete with the most logged miles in a given month. In the past, this took a lot of manual coordination, but with We Work Out and Satellite, the process is seamless and automatic.

What’s more, the users in the workout group don’t even need to know each other anymore, as Soroban builds a framework for trustless payments; everyone sees the rules for the payouts (based on Strava’s data), and the smart contract programmatically enforces those rules. Minimal administration is required.

During the development of Satellite, we will be building toolsets that enable us to more quickly integrate third party software oracles. The goal is to build out Satellite as a SaaS/API model, where developers can leverage Satellite to build their own apps (like we did with We Work Out). As we enable more oracles, the possibilities for developers grows dramatically, as does the utility of Soroban and the Stellar Network. We simultaneously envision building a simple REST API and SDKs for Satellite that integrate with popular development frameworks to speed up the development and deployment of smart contracts linked to software oracles.

We Work Out will continue to be our first, and our flagship, implementation of Satellite. We have identified corporate wellness programs, with a $59B global addressable market, as the path to growth and profitability for the app. By creating a simplified experience for setting up and launching corporate wellness programs that incentivize employee activity as measured by third party data, we leverage tech to offer a non-existent product that can capitalize on the gap in the corporate wellness space.",,,https://getsatellite.io,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7hL-zY0Bs0,,,,,,,Stephen Looney,,,,,

Our core offering is a unified API designed for efficiently transacting with chains and protocols and sourcing on-chain data, which saves our users significant time and money to access the vast, fragmented Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging our middleware, users can efficiently connect to over 100 distinct endpoints, including chains, DEXs, lending protocols, DEX & yield aggregators, oracles, bridges, and more. Essentially, Expand’s API serves as a single point of access for the Web3 ecosystem, allowing users to quickly and efficiently interact with over 40 different blockchains and protocols.

The Web3 ecosystem is vast, fragmented, and constantly changing. As a result, those building in Web3 and interacting with chains and protocols incur high resource costs and time delays to build and maintain integrations with multiple chains and protocols. This often hinders experimentation, innovation, and ecosystem in Web3. Our goal at Expand is to provide reliable infrastructure that reduces the barriers to iterating with blockchains and protocols, and helps to grow the Web3 ecosystem in an efficient, scalable, and secure manner. Expand’s API solves this problem by functioning as a single point of access for the Web3 ecosystem, allowing users to quickly and efficiently transact with the blockchains and protocols of their choice. By connecting to a single unified API, users can access over 40 chains and protocols and over 100 distinct endpoints, eliminating the need for users to build and maintain these integrations themselves. Users can get up and running more quickly, explore new chains and protocols more easily, and focus their attention on their core priorities.

Expand serves a broad user base that includes trading firms, asset managers & VCs, research analysts, wallets, dapps, tax & accounting firms, and other service providers. Given the diverse applications of the API, virtually every digital asset client type can potentially find valuable uses of the API for their needs. The API allows users to seamlessly transact across the Web3 ecosystem, access on-chain data, monitor chains and protocols, and build DeFi-related features like swaps and lending. Some examples of popular cases include Liquidity Pool Forensics, Portfolio Management, Trading, Transaction & Pool Analysis, and Trade Reconciliation. Whether you are a wallet looking to build swaps or lending features into your front end, a developer seeking to create a prototype, or a research analyst interested in analyzing and monitoring liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges, the Expand API is designed to assist you in achieving your goals more efficiently, saving both time and money.

Expand offers a single unified API with both read and write capabilities that users can leverage to access over 100 distinct Web3 endpoints and over 40 different chains and protocols. The Expand API is designed to be non-custodial and wallet agnostic, allowing the user to select the wallet of their choice when using the API, and preserving control and privacy over their keys at all times. Transactions occur in a secure three-part process: 1) First, a transaction is prepared using the expand.network API. 2) Then the transaction object is securely sent to the wallet for signing. 3) Finally, the Expand API will broadcast the encoded string to the respective chain.

Through this proposed integration, Expand’s API will provide users with direct connectivity to Stellar and Soroban RPC, allowing them to efficiently transact, source data, and build in the Stellar ecosystem. The proposed integration will be designed as an HTTP REST API service, serving as an intermediary between users and the Stellar Network.

Summary
Stellar Surge seeks to build a community of engaged African engineers and startups building on Stellar and Soroban. The program provides a pathway to innovation, learning, and meaningful connections within the African blockchain and developer ecosystem with special focus on building strong partnerships/alliances while supporting and raising developers within the African landscape to launch innovative products using the Stellar and Soroban network.

Background
Africa is home to about 1.4 billion people with a projected population of 2.5 billion in 2050. Business Insider also projects Africa to become the world’s fastest-growing region, with six out of the ten fastest-growing economies in 2023 being African countries. Experts have also indicated that the continent is set to become the next global tech hub with developer communities across the continent growing rapidly, with some of the most significant population increases taking place in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Kenya. The blockchain ecosystem in Africa is not left behind in this growth and development. Amidst previous clampdowns across various African countries, Africa is ushering a new wave of interest in blockchain to provide solutions across various challenges. In 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in South Africa announced a new licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and declared that crypto assets are financial products, lending them greater legal clarity, and also empowering financial investigators to better fight illicit activity in the space. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has also been navigating the crypto landscape, issuing statements on potential volatility risks at the same time as leaders consider the implementation of a CBDC. At the beginning of 2023, the government proposed a bill advocating for a consistent securities definition of digital currencies and diligent recordkeeping by licensed crypto traders. Around the same time, the Nigerian government approved a national blockchain policy, highlighting ways blockchain adoption can benefit the country and paving the way for future legal frameworks. Also, in December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria also released Guidelines On Operations Of Bank Accounts For Virtual Assets Service Providers (Vasps). While there have been a few bumps in the road as regulators became comfortable with the new technology, key trendsetting governments have clearly moved to support blockchain technology and we expect others to follow suit in the coming year.

DFS Lab Proposes a New Program: Stellar Surge

Who is DFS Lab?
The DFS Lab is a venture investor, supporting teams who are transforming daily commerce in Africa. We also operate as an innovation center where we help our partners and clients engage and understand the startup ecosystem in Africa through on the ground research, innovation programs, and strategy development. We have been a long term partner with the Stellar Development Foundation on multiple fronts. We currently manage the Stellar Africa Fund and have collaborated with SDF in organizing 3 past SCF bootcamps, supporting over 100 startups across the globe to build on Stellar. As such, we understand the key value that Stellar brings in supporting founders and developers keen on solving hard challenges through the Stellar and Sorban network. We are keen on working with SDF to achieve the vision of a dynamic and growing ecosystem of builders transforming everyday commerce in Africa using Stellar technology. While we have already built out capital investment and startup support models through our fund and bootcamps, we would like to further our partnership and add a developer and ecosystem engagement program to massively grow and energize the talent pool around Stellar. To achieve this, we, as ecosystem partners, propose the initiative ""Stellar Surge” to engage a much larger community of developers and startups to the Stellar mission. Key objectives include engaging a much larger community than exists now and fostering a thriving Soroban ecosystem building on Stellar.

Table 1: A few examples of DFS Lab’s Successful Developer Engagement Programs

Stellar Africa Fund - a venture fund investing in Stellar companies in Africa. On behalf of the Stellar Development Foundation we manage a venture fund investing in African companies who are using Stellar in unique and impactful ways. Our portfolio consists of top African innovators building the future of commerce on the continent.

Stellar Global Bootcamp. We sponsored a bootcamp that attracted almost 30 companies from around the world to develop on Stellar over a 4 day period. Participating developer(s) and companies joining the bootcamp worked with SDF, DFS Lab, and Stellar ecosystem members to define a problem, storyboard a solution, and develop a rapid prototype before getting feedback from the Stellar community.

Two Stellar Africa Bootcamps. Our virtual bootcamps gave early- to mid-stage startups in Africa an opportunity to build on Stellar, an open-source blockchain network optimized for payments, over a three day period. We engaged 100s of applicants and selected 20 across two bootcamps, most of whom went on to win grants from the Stellar Community Fund and become members of the Stellar Community.

COVID 19 Innovation bootcamp for the Central Bank of Egypt. We did a 4 day developer bootcamp with the Central Bank of Egypt to foster linkages between the fintech community and local banks.

Series of 4 Mojaloop Payment Bootcamps for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We run a developer engagement and bootcamp program for the Gates Foundation’s Mojaloop platform. We use the Design Sprint methodology to do four day sprints to help market leading startups across Africa build cutting edge products incorporating Mojaloop technology.

Digital Kaduna lab supporting startups across Kaduna State in Northern Nigeria. We have a long term collaboration with Colab and the State of Kaduna in Nigeria to support the growth of the digital ecosystem there.

Objectives:
Through Stellar Surge, our long term goals and objectives are to:

Support Stellar Development Foundation in solidifying its presence in Africa through strategic alliances and raising awareness within the developers ecosystem.

Launch a growing community of Stellar developers advocates in Africa.

Create a pipeline for more viable and novel use cases coming from Africa for submission to SCF.

Program Themes and Metrics:
We envision Stellar Surge as a multiyear program that provides a pathway to innovation, learning, and meaningful connections within the African blockchain and developer ecosystem with special focus on building strong partnerships/alliances while supporting and raising developers within the African landscape to launch innovative products using the Stellar and Soroban network. The program is anchored on three interconnected themes: ‘Learning, Community, and Innovative Projects’:

Theme 1: Learning and awareness raising (top of funnel) - While we aim to build awareness of Stellar and the Soroban network within the African blockchain space, Stellar Surge will place priority on learning and building the knowledge bank of developers of what’s possible on the Stellar and Soroban network.

Theme 2: Community building (middle of funnel) - This program will also adopt a set of activities to foster an ongoing community of the developers that we engage through Theme 1 activities. The approach will aim to galvanize developers across the African landscape and create a continuous engagement and learning environment for Stellar developers on the continent.

Theme 3: Innovative Projects (bottom of funnel). With the above, the DFS Lab Stellar Surge team will identify and support developers within the African ecosystem who Stellar should pay close attention to. Alongside constant communication, we will have an on-going quarterly sync with the Stellar team to present these teams, their products, and work together to provide them with the best resources (including potential funding) to build on Stellar and Soroban. Our three-themed approach is designed to first establish the necessary foundation for Stellar with the developer community in Africa through reputation-building, learning, and community. We can then subsequently utilize that pipeline to highlight truly interesting and high potential projects for deeper collaboration with the Stellar team and its suite of developer resources.

Application structure
We have structured our application in two parts. First, we have an overview and long term vision for the program. We want to situate our work in a longer term vision for the project that goes beyond this initial grant. Next comes the specific proposal for what we will do with this initial grant to help launch the program and go through its initial phases.

Long Term Vision for our Stellar Surge Developer Activation Program
To drive the Stellar Surge program, we are proposing a range of initiatives across the 3 thematic areas. These initiatives will be continuous and iterative for a span of the first 12-18 months in which afterwards, documented learnings will be used in designing future interventions. With this first grant we are asking for funding to get started and launch the program over the next 3-4 months whereafter we plan to apply for more funding to continue the program.

Learning and awareness raising:
Organize Developer Activation program(s) as in person events across key regions in Africa. These activation programs are aimed at building awareness of the Stellar and Sorban network in Africa among the developer ecosystem while also building strong partnerships and alliances with the wider blockchain community in Africa. The Developer Activation program has 3 channels:

Side events alongside existing high profile African tech events. Our approach to doing this is to scan high profile events to partner with to organize activation programs as side events. Some of the high profile events we’ll be tracking to accomplish this includes: Fintech Summit in Johannesburg, Africa Fintech Summit in Nairobi, Blockchain Africa conference in Johannesburg etc. We believe a roughly half year cadence for these convenings is enough of an investment to keep the Stellar brand relevant to attendees (vs. going shallow with more events).

Establish partnership with local developer groups for Developer Meetups. Part of our strategy in implementing Stellar Surge, is partnering with developer groups across key regions (Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Rwanda) in Africa to expose community members with existing learning contents on what’s possible with the Stellar and Soroban network. These developer meetups will feature capacity building sessions leaning on the existing developer learning contents and documentation developed by Stellar for a more comprehensive and seamless experience that equips these developers to build on Stellar and/or Soroban network. Meetups will also feature informal conversations with members of the Stellar Community and possibly other blockchain ecosystem players with the goal of promoting more open dialogue across the continent around Stellar, blockchain, and its benefits. We envision that through these meetups, we will create a pipeline for developers to demo their ideas/projects and subsequently create a path for submissions into SCF. Alongside these meetups, we will also launch a Stellar Surge Developers Community which will unveil community champions for Stellar Surge. Community champions are developers who will serve as advocates of Stellar in Africa. Developers will cut across early and mid-stage developers and will also be a part of the Stellar Developers Community on Discord. Some existing developer groups we are tracking to partner with include: Africa Blockchain Institute, Women In Blockchain Africa, HerDAO, Blockchain Nigeria, Blockchain Hub Africa, MEMOI Africa etc.

Outreach to Universities/Colleges. Through the Developer Activation Program, we will harness the growth and interest of the developer ecosystem among undergraduate and fresh graduate college students in key regions in Africa. Our approach to these outreach will rest on building awareness and creating a funnel for developers within colleges to join the Stellar Surge Developers Community and introduce them to opportunities to test and build. We believe working with early developers out of school can be a critical pipeline for fresh new ideas and create long-term champions for Stellar in Africa.

Community building:
Upon the launch of Stellar Surge Developer group (building from our efforts in raising awareness), we will work with the Stellar team in integrating this community on the Stellar Developers Discord with a specific channel dedicated to Stellar Surge Developer group- so that way we are able to measure number of developers who join the group and invariably build a pipeline for projects specific to Africa submitted for SCF funding. We will take an experimental approach to seeing what works to engage and bring value to the community. To keep the community engaged, we will adopt the following:

Day to day engagement: the community manager, DFS Lab team, and community champions will endeavor to stimulate conversation and activity within the subchannel on Discord and to actively manage the community to make sure it is lively, engaging, and produces value for the community members.

Monthly Community Engagement: Drawing from the learnings on the Developer Activation Program, we will adopt a systematic approach in engaging monthly with members of the Stellar Surge developer community. We will host Stellar engineers and mentors at our monthly office hours, ‘Ask Me Anything’/workshop sessions for community members to share their project ideas and get feedback.

Quarterly Stellar Demo/Pitch sessions: We will host quarterly pitch sessions for developers within the African community to pitch their projects with the wider Stellar Developers Community on Discord. We will work closely with the community manager of SDF to host these pitch sessions and help guide the best participants to successful applications.

Innovation projects:
Quarterly pipeline sync with Stellar: Once a quarter our team will summarize our interactions from the above awareness and community-building efforts to highlight the 5 to 10 highest potential and interesting teams whom we believe Stellar should support more deeply. We believe this kind of pipeline curation is critical for your team to utilize its assets in Africa most efficiently while we take on the initial work of qualifying the best teams. Once these teams are identified, we will work with Stellar and the developers to assist in more rapid integration with Stellar by serving as local mentors/liaisons. This may include helping the team submit proposals to the Stellar Community Fund if appropriate.",,,www.dfslab.net,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xWT6To9u8,,,,,,,Jake Kendall,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/dfslab,https://twitter.com/TheDFSLab,,

- Italy: €973,710,000
- Spain: €717,030,000
- Netherlands: €153,450,000
- Germany: €650,070,000
- France: €112,530,000

The data above is from the World Bank Bilateral Remittance Matrix analysed by Pew Research. The proposed SEP-31 implementation would allow any Stellar wallet containing Circle EURC on Stellar to execute cross border payments between Europe and Nigeria. The MYKOBO xBorder widget included in the proposal will take into account the functionality required to trigger a SEP-31 transaction by a sending anchor which in this case is the MYKOBO ANCHOR. Circle EURC is issued by Circle Financial Inc., one of the largest Stablecoin issuers in the world. Circle EURC is issued on Stellar and other blockchains. Current reserves of €50.1M as of 18 February 2024.",,,https://circle.anchor.mykobo.co/sep31/info,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19lp9aDHZP7wTfR-K0dM-EWZ_DB34gZ-I/,,,,,,,"Jordan Harry, iamthemandarin , Oluwaseyi Akin-Olugbemi ",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/myk0b0,https://twitter.com/myk0b0,https://discord.gg/6ByPsKGFWR,

The problems Paychant solves

Paychant gives African businesses and individuals who are underserved by fiat rails a better way to access digital dollars (Stellar USDC) for cross-border remittance, payroll payments, and individual savings against local currency devaluation. Through Paychant infrastructure, businesses and individuals can onramp and offramp digital dollars through mobile money and bank transfers.

We’re building this ramp anchor using the SEP24 wallet standard (Hosted Deposits and withdrawals), so it will be compatible with all standard wallets and dApps on Stellar, this will enable a smooth on and off-ramp of Stellar USDC through deep local payment method coverage in Africa.

The payment rails we support are:
1. M-Pesa in Kenya.
2. MTN MoMo, AirtelTigo, Vodafone cash in Ghana.
3. Airtel Money, MTN MoMo, in Uganda.
4. Local bank transfer in Nigeria.

The Stellar's integration with Moneygram is a great step in making cash on/offramp more usable for remittance, however, there's an additional possibility to improve usability by on/off-ramping directly into the recipient's mobile money wallet, which is what we're building for this project.

Key Features we will provide:
1. Mobile money payment method: the predominant method of payment in Africa. This will ensure a simple cash-in and out with just a phone number.
2. Bank account number validation: We've incorporated a system that enables instant account number validation for all banks in Nigeria, creating a smooth UX for offramping.
3. Phone number Auth: We strongly support a mobile-first approach, hence, we use phone numbers as a method of authentication.

Use case

Within any Stellar wallets or dApps, users would be able to cash in or cash out using the wallet or dApps in-app native experience. After selecting Paychant, if it's the users' first time, they will be asked to provide their KYC alongside their phone number. Paychant will send an OTP to confirm the user is associated with the phone number provided. Thereafter in subsequent visits, the user will only enter the amount to cash out. Same process for cash-in (onramp).",,,https://paychant.com/,,https://youtu.be/N778Nbr-BHQ,,,,,,,"Moses Adeniji, Gabriel Adeniji ",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/paychant/?viewAsMember=true,https://twitter.com/paychant,https://discord.gg/YUXPAJfZaN,https://docsend.com/view/2ntrvtgyer7mp8u6

What it is: Set recurring payments to outside stellar accounts.

Problem & Solution: Projects on Stellar might want to offer subscriptions to users, but would need to do a lot of work to integrate all anchors into their platform. We want to offer Beans as a solution there. Outside projects can request recurring payments from Beans users via a link or QR.

How it Works & Uses Stellar: The user will scan a QR that works with the merchant check-out API we have built. This deeplinks the user to the app, here the user should confirm the proposed recurring payment. Next the app will invoke a smart contract that sets the payments.

Smart wallet infrastructure

What is is: Back-end change to better support future Soroban & DeFi integrations.

Problem & solution: As some might have seen we have done a PoC on a Blend lending pool integration into Beans. This PoC has been done in a separate environment where we cut out our current savings balance and replaced it with Blend lending pools. During this PoC, we have realized that we need to update the back-end to be better suited for integrations with Soroban. One of the key elements is that we now have currencies that are either spendable or savings currencies. However, when working with Soroban, spendable currencies like USDC, actually go into a smart contract and thus are also a savings currency. This is not how the current back-end is set-up.

How it works & uses Stellar: We will update the back-end to smoothen integrations with protocols like Blend. In the future, this will allow us to support multiple savings protocols at the same time, while that is not the case right now.

Country based recommendation

What it is: Recommend the best deposit currency and method based on location.

Problem & Solution: We’d like to incorporate location to determine the best currency/method to deposit with.

How it Works & Uses Stellar: We will fetch the users location and use that to recommend a specific deposit currency. In a future iteration we will use the location to determine the best method and anchor as well.

Send to any phonenumber

What it is: Send money to any phonenumber, even if it’s not a beans user yet.

Problem & Solution: Users want to send money to friends that do not necessarily have the app installed yet. We want to provide a way to send money to any phonenumber in a decentralized way, so that users don’t have to first ask their friends to download the app.

How it Works & Uses Stellar: We are using SEP 30 for this and have completed most of the work needed, we just need to create a flow that merges the funded account back into the original account as well as some UI changes. This work was scheduled during our previous entry, but because of the shift of focus isn’t completed yet.

QR/link check-out public API

What it is: Allow other companies to generate pay with Beans links/QR codes.

Problem & Solution: We have done a lot of work to make on/offramping very easy and accessible. We want to offer this to other ecosystem companies as well.

How it Works & Uses Stellar: We are building a public API that generates a link or QR that includes amount, currency, destination address and a webhook callback + optional memo. A Beans user scans the QR and pays with their preferred currency. The webshop now never has to know what type of transaction they have to set-up, they just generate the link and Beans will generate the corresponding transaction. Webhooks will allow the merchant to move on with the payment flow when the transaction was completed. The API is ready, next we will build a javascript SDK and set-up the documentation.",,,www.beansapp.com,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VNCxoAmOtY,,,,,,,"Jop Middelkamp, Wouter Arkink",,,https://twitter.com/BeansApp,https://beansapp.medium.com/,

It is also designed to transform payment processing, project management, and to instill transparency in financial transactions using Stellar's peer-to-peer operations and the Stellar Disbursement Platform, with future implementations planned for Stellar's Moneygram services, and USDC payments.

A notable use-case is enabling attorneys to manage their clients' trust accounts transparently and accountably. This includes a transparent (to all participants) Construction Control, Custodial Trust Account Ledger Management, IOLTA or Trust Account Ledger Management and Payment Disbursement. To reach a wider market Pakana also offers an escrow-based Software Project Development workflow suitable for various freelancer use-cases. In the future, Pakana will offer a wide range of professional and legal services through advanced automation and AI enhanced processes and our growing professional community.

At its heart, Pakana is a blockchain-driven metadata management platform, implemented as a DotNet Core API with a Razor Pages application. It integrates PostgreSQL, optional Azure Storage and/or IPFS, and other services. Further details are provided in the Technical Architecture document. This versatile platform streamlines work execution and payment, ensuring swift, secure, and cost-effective transactions, with cryptographic documentation of every transaction phase.

Challenges Addressed:
- High transaction fees and cumbersome payment processing with weak project management tools and services on traditional Web2 freelancer platforms.
- Trust and transparency concerns with current freelancing platforms.
- A growing demand for a secure, decentralized platform tailored for fiduciaries, like attorneys, for meticulous audited account management.

Solutions:
- Pakana leverages Stellar's multi-signature wallets to facilitate a ""peer-to-peer escrow"" mechanism for swift, secure, and low-cost payments.
- It fosters a transparent setting for work delivery, payment verification, and tailored collaboration.
- Pakana's core technology provides a white-label SaaS solution for attorneys, offering IOLTA Account Management Services for Statutory Construction Control and Client Trust Account Payments and Ledger Management.
- Collaborations have been established with licensed attorneys across various jurisdictions to develop and offer trust and IOLTA account management services once the core Pakana Lockb0x features are operational.
- By utilizing Stellar's blockchain, Pakana tokenizes trust assets, offering immutable transaction ledgers for audit support and full transparency.
- Through Stellar's Disbursement Platform or Moneygram implementation, fiduciaries can serve their clients transparently, providing a comprehensive auditable record of all transactions.
- Pakana will maintain its own Horizon API Server VM for peak performance.

Target Audience:
Pakana appeals to freelance software developers, creators, craftsmen, tradesmen, attorneys, escrow agents, fiduciaries, businesses, and individuals seeking a mechanism to ensure funds are secured before work begins and contract conditions are met prior to fund or asset transfers. Future implementations of Soroban Contracts and configurable bot-based deliverable verification and dispute-resolution processes will further streamline project and payment escrow transactions.

Operational Overview and Integration with Stellar and/or Soroban:
- Pakana uses Stellar's multi-signature wallets and the Stellar Disbursement Platform for efficient peer-to-peer transactions.
- Its user-friendly interface presents a dashboard to oversee Stellar blockchain accounts and multi-signature wallet-accounts, employing an Account/Organization/Project hierarchy for work and payment management.
- Users can curate a template library for emails, documents, invoices, legal notices, and more, activated by specific transaction workflow triggers.
- Projects commence with the initiation of a multi-signature account, co-signer invitations, and task setups with clear deliverables and payments.
- Once funded, payments can be requested, reviewed, and disbursed from the task's Stellar multi-signature account.
- Transactions are tracked using Pakana's Merkle Tree model, culminating in a Zero-Knowledge Proof stored in the transaction memo. This also serves as a pointer to the transaction metadata in Pakana.
- Pakana seamlessly integrates traditional ""Web2"" technologies with blockchain intricacies, employing relational databases, APIs, and cloud-based micro-services.
- Prioritizing security and non-custodial protocols, all transactions are executed client-side using the Stellar Horizon JS SDK and verified server-side using the Horizon DotNet SDK.
- Pakana emphasizes decentralization, granting users full control over transactions and data, with an export feature available anytime.
- Although the initial release omits Soroban features, Pakana plans to integrate specific transaction processes as Soroban Smart Contracts in future phases.
- While not in the initial offering, Pakana aims to create an oracle service linked to the Plaid Financial Services API to monitor fiat-currency accounts, tokenize Stellar blockchain transactions, and enable ACH payments to better serve their clients.
- One additional benefit of Pakana's Construction Control Approach is that Construction Lien Release and Waiver Documents, which are used to prove there are no lien encumbrances on improved real estate, are tokenized from inception. Which could be an important piece of the real-estate tokenization puzzle.

A personal note from Pakana's founder:
I have been wrestling with the freelancer fee platform problem for many years, as a Buyer and Seller on these platforms. With fees often running up to 30% or more for a project's development for little value, other than expensive payment processing and a so-so marketplace. I have spent the last 2 years learning about Stellar then defining Pakana's services which has leaped over my initial goals, thanks to the availability of the Disbursement Platform, and Moneygram. This allowed Josh and I to focus on proof-of-concept tests, gather feedback from future customers, develop a selection of common use-cases. We are excited to finally focus, build-out, and launch the last 30% of the core project. Then get on to the next phase of the journey of building the business and adapting to the market's guidance.

CashAbroad facilitates cross-border payments with USDC and Fiat.,"Letter of Credit

A letter of credit is a financial instrument used in international trade to facilitate secure and reliable transactions between a buyer (importer) and a seller (exporter). It serves as a guarantee to ensure that the seller and the buyer will complete correctly the transaction and receive/make the payment. This is a required finance tool in industries such as automotive, manufacturing, maintenance, repairs, and oil & gas often need to import machinery, repair parts, chemicals, and materials.

Problem

Letters of credit can be expensive and time-consuming, requiring an intermediary bank to generate them, which takes between 3-5 days and charges up to 10% of the LC value. Additionally, not all businesses have access to these financial tools. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that need to make international transactions face the challenge of not qualifying for such instruments and taking risks when dealing with unknown international partners. Businesses face the challenge of finding new international providers and taking on risks during financial transactions due to varying requirements and conditions.

Users

Import and export businesses around the world that require a secure payment method for both parties.

Solution with Stellar and Soroban

The CashAbroad platform will enable the exporter and importer to agree on the terms and conditions of the credit letter for the transaction. Parameters such as payment amount, delivery date, importer and exporter wallets, Incoterms, and payment policies will be taken into account. Once the agreement is reached, they will sign it, and the credit letter will be issued in Soroban. The importer will then be required to send the money, which will be stored in an escrow wallet. The exporter will receive a confirmation and proceed to produce and send the product. When the product arrives at the agreed delivery location based on the Incoterm, the status will be updated, and the payment will be received by the exporter. By implementing this solution, we will provide a secure and reliable payment method for both importers and exporters.",,,https://www.cashabroad.one,,https://youtu.be/slCNzYGEboY,,,,,,,"Braulio Alejandro Ramírez Montiel, Ruth Gomez Hidalgo",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cashabroad/,https://twitter.com/CashAbroadApp,,

While service providers seek sustainable revenue, service consumers desire consistent service utility. Unfortunately, current payment standards could hinder attracting the most users and, in return, affect the growth of service providers. Existing models often mandate lump-sum or fixed-interval payments. The inflexibility challenges can misalign with user needs and business monetization strategies and deter potential adopters or affect adopter retention. Such challenges include:

- Traditional financial systems lag in offering real-time tools. This can be unattractive for potential investors or stakeholders.
- Consumers face limited choices between full purchases or extended subscriptions, even for short-term usage, which might discourage potential subscribers.
- Freelancers often face payment delays or defaults, and on the flip side, clients are apprehensive about paying for work that might not be delivered, limiting opportunities and collaborations.
- Distributing rewards promptly and effectively so they successfully incentivize desired behaviors or actions remains a challenge.

Solution: Token streaming provides an innovative solution to these challenges, offering continuous transactions and ensuring attractiveness, flexibility, and trust in financial engagements.

Product: Fluxity is an innovative token streaming solution aiming to revolutionize financial transactions through fluidity and efficiency. By providing a unified, secure, and user-friendly solution for token streaming, Fluxity can fill this gap in the Stellar ecosystem. It offers a valuable tool that users, developers, and businesses can leverage to harness the power of token streaming, leading to enhanced efficiency, novel use cases, and potentially disruptive business models.

How it works: On Fluxity, users can opt for linear or exponential token streaming, initiate streams with set tokens or by period, define start/end times, and utilize cliff streams to delay token distribution. Unique features include batch streaming, representing streams as NFTs, auto transferring, vesting streams, and stream bites for indefinite streaming. Fluxity's server acts as an off-chain tracker. It also provides a payment gateway, API, hooks, and SDK for easy integration. We use Rust with the Soroban package for the contracts and adhere to specific and strict standards to improve security. We will comment on every part of the code for better readability and write documentation for all contracts. Writing tests for different stream states is one of the essential tasks to ensure the correct smart contract operation. For the front end of the project, we use React - NextJS for Server Side Rendering, which improves SEO, and we utilize reusable components that make program development more accessible and code more readable. Additionally, we use TypeScript to manage the project on a large scale better and to reduce the risk of encountering runtime errors. Our codes will be completely open-source.

Target audience: Token streaming can appeal to a wide range of audiences:

- Institutions interested in providing real-time dividends or interest payouts to attract investors seeking real-time returns on their investments,
- Any service or platform that uses a subscription model, from software providers to news websites that want to attract a broader range of users,
- Companies or individuals seeking real-time salaries or wage access aligned with work output,
- Businesses intending to offer real-time rewards or incentives to their customers or users.

Benefits: Token streaming promises to open up a whole new realm of possibilities, such as real-time payment for services and utilities or continuous crowdfunding campaigns where the flow of funds can be adjusted in real-time based on project milestones.

By integrating Stellar to keep an immutable trace of the origin of products, TYPIQO will allow Chefs and patrons alike to verify where the ingredients of their dishes were sourced from.

Problem

TYPIQO has identified a gap in the market where:
1. Chefs must deal with multiple local producers, leading to inefficiencies and taking them away from what they do best: Creating dishes.
2. Chefs need to tell stories behind their dishes; This becomes easy by having local, sustainable produce that is fully traceable.

Solution

TYPIQO is solving the problem of the disconnect between local producers and Chefs with an end-to-end platform that leverages this relationship, digitizing both the Chef and the Producer simultaneously. TYPIQO wants to solve the transparency and traceability problem by leveraging the Stellar blockchain.

TYPIQO in a nutshell:
1. Product selection: TYPIQO finds and selects local producers and products that fit traceability, quality, and sustainability criteria as defined by TYPIQO.
2. Chef’s Automation: TYPIQO provides a Chef Platform where they can make their weekly orders seamlessly, with a dynamic and integrated catalogue to TYPIQO's inventory management system.
3. Producer’s Automation: TYPIQO also provides a platform where each local producer can manage their products directly integrated into the Chefs catalogue on the Chefs Platform.

Leveraging Stellar for transparency and traceability

TYPIQO visits each local producer and audits and verifies their business practices to ensure they are sustainable and traceable. If they meet the criteria, each product from this producer is awarded a TYPIQO-issued asset that represents the compliance of that specific product. Producers get a non-custodial Stellar account associated with them once they sign up for TYPIQO (this is so TYPIQO in the future can operate as an independent certification authority, regardless of where the products are sold). Leveraging Stellar’s granular asset issuance options, TYPIQO can ensure only certified providers can hold the relevant assets.

1. Products ordered are matched with certified products (TYPIQO-issued assets), and transactions are created between TYPIQO and Producers (e.g. TYP000000001 amount 5 – this represents 5kg of tomatoes from producer A). Units and descriptions will be included in the asset’s metadata.
2. Producers sign the transaction representing the orders they’ll be fulfilling.
3. TYPIQO signs and submits the transaction once received in the warehouse.
4. When TYPIQO dispatches the orders, transactions are created with TYPIQO and Chefs as signers. TYPIQO signs.
5. Upon receiving the order, the Chef signs the transaction, which is submitted.
6. At the restaurant, a per-dish QR code can be scanned, taking the user to the TYPIQO website to show a certificate that displays the journey of the ingredients from the producers to their table. They can email it to themselves for closer inspection.",,,https://test-hub.typiqo.it/,,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBxRKlRrRcjyJwLgerFIFcMEWmG6ojEF?usp=sharing,,,,,,,Alessandro Badalamenti,,,,,
LocalCoin,SCF #21,LocalCoin,LocalCoin,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recBuWuli95RQarWV,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$40875.00,$40875.00,339293.60,12/5/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,LocalCoin enables on-chain control of financially incentivized action to help social good orgs with effectiveness and trust.,"About

LocalCoin is a closed cycle token system designed to enable on-chain control and tracking of financial incentives in the real world. It is a product and service that manages the disbursement of funds which have restrictions on how they may be spent, comprising smart contracts on Soroban, a web app and mobile app, and eventually a payment card and seamless DAO integration.

Problems and Solutions

The LocalCoin platform solves problems faced by philanthropic, or social good organizations regarding trust and transparency of how funds are used.

The problems include:
- A lack of transparency for donors into how their donations are used.
- Donor resistance due to the lack of transparency, which limits trust.
- A risk of funds being misused if cash assistance is distributed.
- Possibility that unrestricted funds may quickly leave the community, like going to Amazon purchases, limiting their impact.
- Centralized solutions put all of the burden of scaling on the centralized team.
- Many of the potential recipient communities for assistance like this are wary of being tracked if they participate.

The LocalCoin platform addresses these problems by:
- Providing a closed loop system.
- Providing a mobile dApp that can be used by both merchants and participants to exchange the local currency for the purchase of approved items.
- Enabling transactions with the local currency to be traced by recording them all on chain.
- Allowing definition of flexibly defined restrictions for how the local currency may be spent, with a list of approved merchants and approved items for purchase.
- Allowing for different issuances of currency to have different restrictions.
- Limiting transfers to approved merchants, making trading outside the system infeasible.
- Allowing merchants to redeem the local currency for USD on demand.
- Eventually including ZKP technology (once available on Soroban) to preserve privacy without compromising security and auditability. (Our team has experience implementing core blockchain zk primitives, so when it comes time to include privacy in the LocalCoin product we will explore making a proposal to implement the necessary functionality if it does not exist already.) Currently zk proving times are too long to sustain a sufficiently responsive UX for our target market, but things are evolving rapidly. Across our other zk initiatives we are expecting about a one year timeframe before proving times come down enough to open opportunities beyond the current high value transactions niche.
- Scaling through permissionless participation. Unlike a centralized business where all responsibility for scaling to new markets falls on the founding team, LocalCoin is an open system. As with any project built on blockchain infrastructure and an aim to run as a DAO, LocalCoin is starting with a centralized team and will evolve towards greater decentralization over time. As the processes and best practices are established for onboarding new merchants, launching new tokens in different regions, funding different sorts of campaigns, and other operational details, it will become possible to encode them in governance contracts and eventually manage all LocalCoin operations and expansion through a DAO vote approval process. In this sense the scaling becomes permissionless since anyone who wants to leverage the LocalCoin infrastructure will be free to join and deploy the system wherever they are in the world.

The intended audience for the LocalCoin platform is:
- Local, social good DAOs - This seems like the ideal audience, for which LocalCoin can satisfy the need for fully on-chain governance and execution.
- Stand alone philanthropic organizations.
- NGOs operating in developing countries.
- DAOs more generally, which may become interested to use LocalCoin once the infrastructure has been built out and user experience becomes smooth.

Competitors

There are various existing attempts to address the same challenges. Gift cards have been used (e.g. Amazon) as incentives, for example in a collaboration to clean up Guadalupe River Park in San Jose. UnifyGiving has created a product that enables individuals to give directly to homeless folks that runs on traditional payment rails and has smoothed out a lot of the friction in the system. They are doing good work, and some of what they have created can be a model for us and for organizations that use LocalCoin.

- Gift cards and vouchers may still be bought and sold for fiat at a discount to their face value.
- Attempts to track usage may lead to recipient privacy infringement. Initially, LocalCoin will address this by using an in-person process, but eventually it will be possible to build privacy into the system with ZKPs.
- We have not seen any other projects that are trying to address this with a decentralized approach. A decentralized, open source and open governance solution has benefits for keeping costs low, inspiring trust for donors and participants, and enabling permissionless scaling, as described above.

Revenue Model & Funding

LocalCoin will not run as a for-profit entity. The aim is to reach full decentralization with vote-controlled DAO governance. A small fee will be retained in the LocalCoin DAOfund that will be used to cover servers, maintenance, and upgrade costs. A target number for this fee is 1.5%, but it is too early to calculate this from detailed numbers since we are still only beginning to get the full picture of all the ways in which LocalCoin will be used. So far the reception by people involved in DAOs and other philanthropic organizations has been very positive, and funding through grants is expected to be sufficient to build out and transition to a sustainable state.

Stages of Development

Minimum Product (This Grant)

- This grant proposal covers design, development, deployment, and results analysis for the minimum LocalCoin product. The following details for the minimum product may change:
- The Technical Architecture document specifies what will be built for the Minimum Product.
- Merchants and participants will interact with the system using a mobile app.
- Our team will work with our bicycle shop partner and the We 💜 SF Street Outreach group to onboard participants.
- Donated funds will be used to incentivize participation in a bicycle maintenance, repair and safety program put on by a bicycle shop.
- $2500 will be disbursed through the system.
- One merchant partner, with whom we have already spoken, runs a bicycle shop in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco that supports many immigrants doing bicycle delivery work.
- Attendees of the program will be able to spend their local currency tokens at the bicycle shop and for approved food items from local participating markets.
- Settlement to USD with the merchants will take place by burning the tokens in exchange for fiat in person with the merchant.
- All local currency transactions will execute on the Soroban Futurenet.

Pilot Production Deployment (First Mainnet Launch)

- Planning for a first production deployment is aimed at a local social good DAO in San Francisco. The LocalCoin service will allow a DAO to issue funds to award as incentives to participants in activities that support the DAO's mission. Use of those funds by recipients will be limited to approved products from a network of participating merchants defined in a DAO proposal. Participating merchants will be able to redeem the funds for fiat currency.
- Once Soroban mainnet is live, a pilot production deployment of LocalCoin will be proposed as a supporting service for the multiple DAOs being launched through the We 💜 SF initiative sponsored by GeoBrowser (https://www.geobrowser.io/space/0xc46618C200f02EF1EEA28923FC3828301e63C4Bd/a6510b15-0e8b-4d71-b4db-64c279e21689). Already, DAOs have been started to address needs for Transitional Housing, Workforce Development, Street Outreach, and the Social Laundromat project, all of which will be able to incorporate a local currency.
- The LocalCoin Pilot will focus on DAO integration and seamless local currency to fiat conversion.
- DAOs will need an interface through which they can specify an issuance of local currency to be funded from their DAOfund.
- They will be able to put the local currency issuance to a governance vote that will disburse stablecoin from their DAOfund to LocalCoin and initiate whatever program they wish to incentivize.
- At the other end of the local currency cycle, the merchants will need a simple, low-friction way to convert the local currency to USD in their bank accounts.

Future Plans

Future plans for LocalCoin include making the system more robust for use by those for whom smart phones may not be practical, like the homeless. This will include research and experimentation with RFID systems, like the bracelet used by UnifyGiving, and the crypto payment card offered by Ammer Card. Offering it for funds disbursement by NGOs in developing countries. Plans for this extension of the project have already been put in place for distribution of funds and training classes in the remote historical village of Darche in Nepal. Village leaders are already on board and the majority of adult residents have smart phones.",,,https://venture23.xyz/localcoin,https://github.com/venture-23/localcoin/tree/development,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxRlOxYu_og,,,,,,,Daniel Eric Brehmer,,,,,
IDUNU: Help Kids Thrive,SCF #21,IDUNU: Help Kids Thrive,IDUNU: Help Kids Thrive,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec8hQ6VSQ4036a93,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$15000.00,$15000.00,121792.80,12/12/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"A fundraising and fund distribution platform for high-impact, cost-effective charities working with underprivileged kids.","1- What the product is:

IDUNU: A fundraising and fund distribution platform for high-impact, cost-effective charities and NGOs working with underprivileged kids.

Goal: Empowering charities focused on underprivileged children through a sustainable and transparent, Stellar, and Soroban-powered fundraising and fund distribution platform.

Our target audience includes charities and NGOs, as well as donors who are looking for a trustworthy platform to support underprivileged children.

By leveraging Stellar for transactions and Soroban for smart contracts, the platform will help NGOs raise the necessary funds they need to make a positive impact in the lives of these children and provide a transparent fund distribution platform, ensuring donor funds are accounted for to the last cent.

* IDUNU means Happiness

2- Problems it solves, how it solves them, and the target audience:

I built a small personal portfolio project that helped raise badly needed funds for NGOs who contacted me. Over $2537 (over 2 million naira) in 1 week was raised, and our success was covered in numerous national and international media. I was blown away, and it got me thinking about how we could take this small win and transform it into something truly monumental.

There are over 98 million out-of-school children in Africa (200 million worldwide), and those still in school lack basic learning materials to achieve their dreams. The next generation of digital technologists needs help.

Over the past years, I've worked with NGOs like The Helpmates Foundation and Teens Trust Foundation to donate proper school kits to needy school kids in Nigeria, especially where millions live in extreme poverty.

They all face one problem: the struggle to raise funds for their annual school initiatives due to the country's dire economic situation.

Like mine, there is a big chance crypto has had a huge influence on your life. And we're hoping you can help us build a sustainable fundraising and fund distribution platform for causes that matter. Plus, there is a massive potential for increased media and developer attention for the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem.

By leveraging these platforms, we provide a transparent and sustainable platform that ensures donors are incentivized to donate, and donor funds are utilized effectively, directly benefiting the children in need.

In summary,

Problems:
- NGOs face significant challenges in raising funds for educational initiatives due to economic constraints.
- There is a high number of out-of-school children, and those in school often need more essential learning materials.
- Raising and distributing funds needs more transparency, affecting donor confidence and willingness to contribute.

Solutions:
Building on the previous individual/indie-hacker success and expanding to a:
- A sustainable blockchain-based fundraising platform leveraging Stellar and Soroban offers transparent, low-cost transactions where donors can trace the direct impact of their contributions, ensuring accountability and incentivizing donations.
- Smart contracts automate fund releases upon meeting set conditions, providing donors reassurance that their contributions are utilized precisely for the intended charitable purposes.

Target Audience:
- Individuals and organizations interested in supporting educational initiatives for underprivileged children in Africa.
- NGOs that require a more efficient and transparent way to raise and manage funds.
- Donors seeking a secure and direct method to contribute to causes with tangible outcomes.
- The cryptocurrency community, especially those who have benefited from crypto and wish to give back to society meaningfully.

Benefits:
- It supports the education of the next generation of digital technologists in regions that need it most.
- Ensures that every dollar contributed goes directly to its intended purpose, maximizing the impact of donations.
- Raises awareness and increases media attention for the initiatives and the underlying technology platforms (Stellar and Soroban), creating a win-win situation for the causes and the Stellar community.

3 - Key features:
- User-friendly interface for both charities and donors
- Integration with Stellar and Soroban for blockchain-powered transparency and efficiency.

User-friendly interface for both charities and donors:
A user-friendly interface is essential to ensure that both charities and donors can easily navigate the platform and access the features they need. Our platform will be designed with the user in mind - an intuitive and straightforward interface that makes it simple for charities to set up their fundraising campaigns and for donors to contribute to verified causes they care about. We will also have tools like customizable donation pages - each charity has its page showing current fundraising efforts and fund distribution progress.

The ability to track and distribute funds transparently is crucial in building trust between charities, NGOs, and donors.

4- How it works and how it uses Stellar and/or Soroban:
Our platform leverages Stellar’s unique open blockchain payment features for secure and transparent fundraising and fund distribution. When a donor contributes to a charity or NGO, the funds are tracked on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring that every cent is accounted for. The funds are then distributed to the charity or NGO using Soroban smart contracts, which automate the distribution process and ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose.

Soro-Lock: Transparent fund tracking and distribution:
Integrating Stellar and Soroban into our platform can help provide a level of transparency and security that is unmatched by traditional fundraising platforms. This transparency is achieved through our Soroban-powered smart contracts (using Rust SDK for Soroban Contracts.), introducing critical features like Soro-lock on funds: Time-based Lock, Conditional Release, and Refund Mechanism, ensuring that funds are not misused or misallocated.

Donation:
- Donors choose a campaign and make a donation using mainly Stellar USDC.
- Collaborate with Stellar Anchors like Busha or Accrue for funds distribution to needed parties. Such collaboration is needed for the overall growth of the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem.

Fund Distribution:
- Charities set up fund distribution rules using Soroban smart contracts.
- Smart contracts automate the distribution of funds according to the rules.
- There’s also the possibility of exploring Stellar’s open-source bulk payment solution for humanitarian aid, Stellar Disbursement Platform.

Reporting & Transparency:
- All transactions (donations and fund distributions) are recorded on the Stellar blockchain.
- Donors and charities can view the detailed transaction history and fund usage reports.
- This provides transparency and builds trust between donors and charities.",,,https://www.sponsoraschoolkit.com/ (precursor),,https://youtu.be/Q3isisfEJjM,,,,,,,infovore ,,,,,
Nauta Land,SCF #21,Nauta Land,Nauta Land,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rectnpnWufE42Gm1r,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$82867.40,$82867.40,676725.55,12/12/2023,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,Nauta makes Real Estate investments available to everyone ,"Nauta is a digital investment platform focusing on real estate tokenization, allowing investors to access and invest in fractional ownership of high-quality real estate assets.

The problem

Buyers and investors face significant challenges in the Colombian market. Inflation rises (1), decreasing the purchasing power of investors and resulting in higher material and labor costs (2), as well as increased property costs and interest rates (3). Complex and bureaucratic procedures make real estate transactions overwhelming (4). A down payment of up to 30% of the property value is required (5). Properties in LATAM take as much as 18 months to sell (6).

Solution

Nauta makes Real Estate investment more inclusive and accessible to a broader range of investors. Launched in March 2023, with USD 360,000 AUM for >700 users, Nauta transforms the traditional real estate acquisition model through a user-focused platform for buying, selling, and trading real estate fractions, turning an illiquid market into a liquid one.

Nauta’s operating model

Selection: Nauta selects properties that meet high standards regarding quality, location, profitability, and appreciation. Fractionalization: Nauta fractionalizes the properties into equal parts. Acquisition: Investors can acquire fractions beginning at USD 10. Management: Nauta is the real estate managing each property & tenants. Distribution: Monthly dividend distribution from rents to investors [1] [2] [3] [4]. Liquidity: Retail Investors can sell, buy, and trade tokens with other verified users.

[1] Nauta follows government guidelines and is supervised by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC). [3] Nauta is a member of Colombia Proptech, working with the Financial Superintendence to propose detailed regulations and establish a sandbox for real estate asset tokenization. [4] Only for Colombian users. USA users may not have access due to regulatory restrictions and compliance requirements. As the regulatory landscape evolves, we may expand services to the USA.

Why Stellar

Stellar's advantages, such as low transaction fees, rapid settlement times, and comprehensive asset issuance options, make it an ideal choice for Nauta's platform. Nauta does not operate on any blockchain at the moment.

Nauta's integration with the Stellar blockchain has two distinct phases:

Initial Phase - Transparency and Efficiency: In the first integration with Stellar, Nauta focuses on migrating its current operations to Stellar (Nauta does not operate on any blockchain at the moment) by representing tokenized assets in the Stellar network and creating accounts for existing and new users. Buying and selling property shares between users becomes a simple Stellar payment, and makes dividend distributions transparent to our users.

Second Phase - DeFi platform on Soroban: As Nauta works through the necessary compliance requirements to expand operations to other countries to tap into a broader addressable market, Nauta will take the opportunity to build a genuine DeFi (Decentralized Finance) product on top of Soroban.

Technical

When a new property is purchased, Nauta will issue a new asset. Example: A property is purchased for USD 100,000, so NAUTA issues 100,000 NAUTA01 representing that specific property split in 100,000 equal parts. Another property asset would be coded as NAUTA02, etc. Through its platform, Nauta will limit the purchases to a minimum of 10 USD, and making use of Stellar's comprehensive asset issuance controls, it will freeze the assets in each investor account, until it's time to buy or sell through the Nauta platform, only with other users who have gone through the KYC process. When income for a property is received, Nauta will do off-chain calculations to distribute the dividends proportionally according to the ownership of the NAUTA01 asset. When a property is sold, Nauta will claw back the assets representing that property and send USDC back to the users, which can then be reinvested in other properties.

Nauta’s revenue streams

Sales: 3% fee on initial sales of fractional ownership of the real estate assets. Nauta also earns a 1.5% fee on transactions of existing shares between participants. Property Management: 8% of the rental income generated by each property.

Market Research

While 89% of millennials aspire to generate passive income through property ownership in LATAM [1], the landscape is shifting due to the younger generations' shift in habits [2]. These tech-savvy and experience-seeking individuals prioritize travel and flexibility and shy away from the burdens of traditional responsibilities [3], including hefty down payments and debt [4]. Nauta seizes the potential presented by this generation. LATAM boasts a significant millennial and centennial population, with 330 million across the region [5] and 29 million in Colombia, accounting for 51% of the country's population [6]. Approximately 7.5 million possess the financial means to invest [7]. Nauta aims to capture 10% of this segment or 750k users.

Marketing & Sales

Nauta employs 2 user acquisition strategies. B2C: We actively engage potential individual investors with targeted ads on platforms like Meta. We also invest in content creation, partnering with influencers to extend our reach. A/B tests on channels such as Google and TikTok help optimize customer acquisition. B2B2C: Strategic collaborations with established companies enhance our credibility and provide access to their customer base. Currently, we're beta testing with the Colombian Air Force (11,000 users + families) and Cosmos Security (1,000 employees). These partnerships explore innovative microcredit solutions using real estate tokens as collateral, aiming to onboard up to 12,000 users.

Resources & Relationships

Multidisciplinary Team: Our multidisciplinary team brings together professionals from various fields, such as technology, finance, compliance, real estate, growth, and blockchain. Founder's Industry Knowledge: Stefano Lignarolo, Nauta's CEO, as an architect and real estate developer, has witnessed the difficulties individuals face when acquiring or investing in properties. Strong Alliances: Well-established alliances with real estate developers, homeowners, and Colombian government entities. In-Depth Understanding of Real Estate Transactions: Real-world experience in the sector, from property acquisition to rental management. This expertise allows the platform to streamline processes, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

Legal

The real estate projects that NAUTA offers to its users are materialized through a contractual agreement represented by utility tokens, which are fractional units representing a percentage of the contribution made to each project. These tokens do not constitute securities, financial instruments, or investments according to Colombian law (Law 964 of 2005). Therefore, NAUTA cannot be considered a fund manager or engaged in any activities described in the securities law or related to investment funds. Additionally, to ensure security and compliance, NAUTA follows Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. These steps verify user identities and prevent illegal financial activities. Our commitment to these practices fosters a trustworthy and transparent environment for all participants in our real estate investment ecosystem. Nauta Propiedades owns the properties and enters into a usufruct contract with Nauta Land. Nauta Land transfers the usufruct contract to the users, supported by tokens. This contract, represented by the tokens, grants users the right to receive lifelong earnings from rental income and property appreciation as long as they own the tokens.

Does Or Will Your Project (Mainly) Serve An Underserved Audience?

Yes. Approximately 70% of the Latin American population falls under the category of unbanked (meaning they either lack access to checking/saving accounts) or underbanked (have bank accounts but limited access to credits and loans) [1]. Interestingly, cash remains the dominant mode of payment for most retail transactions in the region. This significant number of individuals highlights the pressing need for innovative financial solutions to promote greater financial inclusion and accessibility to formal financial services. Companies like Nauta are at the forefront of addressing these challenges, offering platforms and technologies that bridge the gap and empower individuals with opportunities for investment and economic growth. Through Nauta's inclusive real estate investment platform, we aim to make a positive impact on this underserved population, providing them with a pathway to participate in the real estate market and unlocking new avenues for financial inclusion in the region. This approach creates a more inclusive way to invest, breaking down barriers and opening doors for individuals who may have thought real estate investing was only for the wealthy. With Nauta, anyone can enter the market and become a real estate investor with a small amount of money. By tokenizing real estate assets and making them available at such accessible prices, Nauta empowers individuals to diversify their investment portfolios and potentially benefit from the returns that real estate can offer. It brings the advantages of real estate investment within reach for a broader range of people, fostering financial inclusion and providing opportunities for wealth accumulation. Through Nauta's platform, individuals can experience the benefits of real estate investment, such as potential rental income and property appreciation, regardless of their initial investment size. This democratization of real estate investment helps level the playing field and creates a more inclusive investment landscape for all.",,,"https://www.nauta.land/ , https://stellar.nauta.land",.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5dbp3ws85g,,,,,,,Stefano Lignarolo,,,,,

Problem: People donate to feel good; however, the donation experience (DX) doesn’t fit the modern, digitally-native donors (GenZ & GenY or Millennials) who are walking away from charities, putting additional stress on a fragmented and unbalanced sector. There is a problem of convenience, accessibility, and transparency. There are 60K charities in Australia (N.B: 1.4M in the US), and information is spread across multiple platforms/mediums. Less than 5% of the charities get 80% of the donations. 57% of the donations are made through doorknock appeal, and 93% of the charities do not have online fundraising capabilities, according to the ACNC’s June 2023 report. Millennials support 3.3 charities on average (US), but the amount they typically donate makes splitting inefficient. Donating to charity aggregators means losing visibility on where the funds are going. TAP4Change wants to reach charities worldwide, and remittance fees constitute a significant issue when maximizing the donation value and the settlement time.

Solution: A social micro-funding platform, TAP4Change makes it easy, fun, and rewarding to show what YOU stand for! Donors can discover, support, and follow the impact of the charities that share their values. Features: Our crowdsourced matching engine lets users pick the charities they care about amongst ALL the charities. Our micro-payments solution allows users to donate small amounts but fund multiple charities with real-time payments. Our gamified (via NFTs) UX and deep social integrations allow users to shine beyond the TAP4Change platform, getting social status and maximizing EROD. Charities gain exposure and community engagement. Responsible companies get an evergreen platform for brand building and customer + employee engagement. Our portfolio system lets users stay in control of their donation subscriptions. Donors can copy other donors' portfolios to donate to the same charities.

Why Stellar: Stellar is designed to store and move money; in the traditional finance world, microtransactions and remittances are a sure way of losing money. With Stellar’s unique value, TAP4Change can pay charities worldwide in real-time. A secondary aspect of our application leverages donation badges as NFTs that donors can showcase.",,,https://www.tap4change.org/,,https://youtu.be/RN0enBrLh2k,,,,,,,Thibault Roumagoux,,,,,

Planet Pay is a B2B solution that leverages ScaleMote’s experience and cultivated business relationships to offer robust and battle-tested integrations with: Anchors (Anclap, MYKOBO, Alfred Pay, nTokens, etc.), Other B2B providers (Blox, Pomelo, Persona for KYC, etc.), Stellar solutions (such as Recovery Platform, Disbursement Platform and Anchor Platform) and Other SCF projects (both Soroban & Classic).

Besides the optional white-label wallet, which is plug-and-play, businesses can use the Planet Pay API to manage and access their integrations. Because ScaleMote is a service provider, Planet Pay will be offered in a DIY model (Saas) or DIF (do-it for me), where ScaleMote builds the integration for the business. This business model ensures Planet Pay does not require continued support from the SCF to operate.

As part of Planet Pay's offering, we are also launching an onramp service in Australia to onramp AUD and convert them into Novatti's AUDD, Circle's EURC or Circle's USDC.

Problem: Slow speed-to-market and high cost

We have seen the same pattern: Entrepreneurs who want to play in the Fintech space or want to offer embedded finance have to do the same integrations; these integrations are slow and require thorough verification that everything works as expected before going to production and end up costing tens of thousands of dollars in software development effort.

Planet Pay allows entrepreneurs to build their fintech infrastructure by selecting the integrations they want for Onramp, Offramp, KYC, Physical and virtual Cards, and other Stellar Projects (both for Classic and Soroban). The work we've done under the ""Stellar Flow"" project is now a subset of Planet Pay, catering to complex workflows or integrations (see more details in our technical architecture document).

As part of the infrastructure setup, entrepreneurs can choose other modules, such as SDP for mass disbursements and the Anchor Platform to issue their assets.

Finally, entrepreneurs can launch their project with a white-label SEP-30-compliant wallet, which can be registered as an SDP provider.

There is a fact of inherent low security of smart contract products on permissionless blockchains. In 2022 about $1 billion was spent on smart contracts security (development toolchain, processes, audits), yet $3.8 billion was lost due to attacks and vulnerabilities. Large percentage of attacks don’t happen in a single transaction but often executed over multiple steps. These steps manifest distinctive suspicious behavior within a relatively long time window. Extractor identifies and tracks multiple attack vectors and quickly notifies Contract owners of imminent or on-going attack with a capability to automatically prevent a loss with automatic contract circuit breaking or pausing. Our primary clients are crypto-native startups and established projects who want to protect their products. There are multiple cases where a single attack drained majority of the funds and effectively bankrupted the project. Extractor works by streaming blockchains activity (transactions, events) in near real-time to a trigger engine. Triggers represent a logic to detect suspicious activity. Trigger can be either something simple like unusually large fund transfer from Contract or complex scenarios involving accounts funded from Mixers and deploying suspicious attacking contracts in a multistep decision tree model. Trigger are either configured by experts (either Extractor team or client engineering team) or Extractor provides a set of preconfigured attack detectors which work automatically for new clients.

Our platform aims to provide a user-friendly interface and a wide range of tools to support users throughout their blockchain journey.

We at onboarding.club have a clear mission: to address the challenges faced by builders and potential builders within the blockchain ecosystem, regardless of their experience level, and help solve the complete builder 0 to 1 cycle. This includes taking an enthusiast (be it a techy/designer/product person) from learning about the ecosystem, writing their first contract, deploying it, building a dApp, to finally building a project and then upscaling it to a product on top of the chain.

With the launch of Soroban smart contracts, Stellar is now open to a much larger audience of builders and developers to adopt and build on top of. Primarily focusing on the high developer activity regions such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other South Asia nations, we want to build a streamlined platform with the following modules for a developer to start from building a project to making it a sustainable product on Stellar.

We would have a dedicated subdomain for every blockchain we onboard, featuring customized modules to meet specific ecosystem requirements. For Stellar, the dedicated subdomain would be stellar.onboarding.club. Capitalizing on our longstanding relations with Stellar, Flow, and Cosmos, we built our MVP with these blockchains for a showcase at Token2049 and garnered a lot of interest from builders and organizations alike as we now look to build it further. You can check out the Stellar MVP at https://app.onboarding.club/stellar.

Our Modules for the Stellar Hub:

🌐 /hub: The starting point for all things Stellar, the hub provides access to Stellar and Soroban statistics, onboarding resources, links to documentation, and more. The resource hub would have gamified mini-courses curated by our team along with quizzes and NFT rewards at the end of every course with course completion status being tracked completely on-chain. You can check out the Figma designs here to understand how the v1 of a mini-course would look like: Figma link. Inspired by Sorobanathon: First Light, we will be introducing a Community Resource section where users can write and link articles related to Stellar and Soroban, creating a central repository for knowledge sharing. There would be an on-chain reputation system built incentivizing users to add and keep updating the community resources which will be accessible and can be updated by making PRs into our GitHub repo. Earning points through the reputation system will give users exclusive early access to Gigs and Job listings.

💼 /gigs: For anyone seeking to unlock their earning potential, /gigs is the right place to take on bite-sized projects. Whether you're a frontend developer looking for a small UI fix or a copywriter specializing in product branding, /gigs is your go-to place. It's the single platform where Soroban builders and projects can easily connect with each other. We would be implementing escrow contracts written in Soroban, providing a secure and transparent system for managing gig disbursements. This ensures that both organizations and builders can engage in projects with confidence, knowing that payments will be handled efficiently and fairly. Along with the on-chain payouts, the gig applications will also be submitted on-chain for anyone to come and have a look at other submissions. Through Soroban smart contracts, it will be made sure that the applications are secure until the gig deadline so that there is no cheating with the submissions. Note: To begin with, we will be reaching out to Stellar projects individually raising awareness about the platform. Being part of the SCF directory, having access to the ecosystem projects, we would be reaching out to all the previous funded projects about the existence of such a platform and an easy walkthrough guide of how they can come onboard and list their gigs.

🚀 /hack: When it comes to hackathons, finding the right teammates can make all the difference. Onboarding.club recognizes a common challenge in the hackathon world – the teammate search. That's why we've made it easier than ever for you. Our platform revolves around users' Proof of Work, taking into account their skills, experiences, and past hackathon achievements across various blockchain ecosystems. This unique approach enables participants to effortlessly connect with ideal teammates during hackathons. To add an extra layer of credibility and fun, we would be introducing on-chain NFT badges. These badges, powered by Soroban smart contracts, will serve as digital credentials for users' achievements and contributions within the hackathon community. They not only highlight their skills but also make them stand out in the decentralized crowd.

🎙 /social: The community and social hub for web3 ideas. People can share their projects/ideas, connect with similar minds, and work together to create the next big thing. From one-on-one messaging to a forum where users can post their ideas, take product reviews, and more, social would be a thriving hub for people to grow together in the ecosystem.

👨🏻‍💻 /jobs: The /jobs module isn't just a job listing board; it's an intricate system that aligns talent with opportunity. It aggregates opportunities from across the network serving as the central hub for job listings within the Stellar ecosystem. Leveraging the user's ""Proof of Work"" (POW), it encapsulates a user's blockchain journey, skills, and achievements. Users create comprehensive profiles showcasing their blockchain skills, experiences, and contributions. The contributions on the platform across ecosystems also get added to their profile. This POW becomes the beacon for organizations searching for the right fit. It ensures that job listings are paired with individuals whose qualifications are a perfect match.

🌱 /seed(grants/funding): Bridging the gap from concept to acceleration. In collaboration with Stellar, we would be launching an accelerator/instagrants for builders to elevate their hack projects or side initiatives to the next stage. Organizations can seamlessly identify potential projects primed for acceleration, source skilled talents, and embark on a journey from concept to thriving reality. Apart from this, we would help projects connect to the right VCs and Angels on the platform for them to turn their ideas into impactful, sustainable ventures. Consider it like a stripped-down AngelList of sorts where VCs and Angels can have access to the entire portfolio of projects built on the Stellar ecosystem and invest in the right startup they see potential in.

Community: We are looking to drill down deep in India to begin with and help incentivize builders to build on Stellar. We plan to do this by the following ways:

- College Sessions: Hosted bimonthly, we aim to conduct hands-on sessions educating people about Soroban across Indian colleges with having 50-100 college students for each session we do helping them come onboard and start building.
- City Meetups: These would be oriented towards increasing awareness about the Stellar ecosystem and what it is all about. Once we start getting developer interest out of this, we will start doing doubt sessions and ideathons with builders looking to provide value to the Stellar ecosystem. We plan to do two general meetups and one developer meet monthly.
- Builder Houses: These will be quarterly builder houses planned and executed in collaboration with the SDF foundation where we set up a small group of 10-15 people building products end-to-end with incentivized rewards (Bounty + SCF acceleration) at the end of the builder house with viable products coming out.

Our goal by the end of April 2024 is to have:

- 500+ new developers on the Stellar hub actively engaging with different modules.
- 15+ local Stellar meetups in India and 20+ across the globe via the community module mentioned above.
- 10+ Active Stellar Gigs at any given point on the platform.
- Impactful and Active usage of the Jobs board and Social Hub with ideas being discussed and mentorship being provided to builders across the ecosystem.
- At least one quarterly Stellar hackathon collaborated with SDF.

Glo Dollar,SCF #21,Glo Dollar (USDGLO) on Stellar,Glo Dollar,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recYngYa4zx3MwZa9,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$13000.00,$13000.00,112311.00,11/27/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"Glo is the stablecoin that generates basic income for people in extreme poverty, and deploy liquidity on StellarX.","A fiat-backed, U.S. regulated stablecoin

Glo Dollar is a new stablecoin. It’s comparable to USDC: always 1:1 redeemable for US dollars, fully backed by cash and short-term US Treasuries.

Glo is regulated in the United States. Reserve assets are held across several US financial institutions, with a monthly breakdown of assets published at https://brale.xyz/stablecoins/USDGLO

Generating basic income for people in extreme poverty

Glo Dollar is the anti-poverty stablecoin. As market cap goes up, extreme poverty goes down.

Here’s how it works: Like other stables, Glo Dollar makes money from the interest on the fiat reserves. The difference: the Glo Foundation does not make profits. Instead, we donate 100% of the interest we receive to GiveDirectly, the world’s fastest-growing charity. They provide basic incomes for people living in extreme poverty, in countries such as Kenya.

As a result: when Glo Dollar adoption grows, we lift more people out of extreme poverty by funding their basic incomes.

Glo enables donationless philanthropy

Glo can be used like any other stablecoin, but it also enables a new crypto use case: donationless philanthropy. Glo Dollar users automatically reduce extreme poverty without paying for it. This new form of philanthropy is made possible by the stablecoin business model. Like any stablecoin, holding Glo Dollar is free. But holding it does grow the Glo Dollar market cap, meaning the reserves contain more assets. And more assets yield more interest, meaning we’ll give more money to GiveDirectly, meaning fewer people will live in extreme poverty (because they receive a basic income).

Donationless philanthropy can lift millions of people out of extreme poverty

At scale, we expect to be able to keep one person out of extreme poverty for every $20,000 of Glo Dollar adoption. Learn why. For comparison, at the time of writing, Tether’s market cap is $83.8 billion. At that size, Glo would be lifting an expected 4.2 million people out of extreme poverty.

What does Glo bring to the Stellar ecosystem?

A new stablecoin. Mission-driven, fiat backed & US regulated. Stablecoins power some of Stellar’s best use cases and form a key component of the ecosystem. It’s healthy to have various alternatives to choose from.

A new use case: donationless philanthropy. With Glo, Stellar ecosystem participants can reduce poverty at zero cost.

A new way to fulfill Stellar’s mission: to create equitable access to the global financial system.

The Glo App

Donationless philanthropy is a new reason for consumers and businesses to use stablecoins for real-world transactions. To show the impact holders are having, we built the Glo App. When you connect your wallet, the Glo App shows the amount of basic income you’re generating per year and explains what this means for someone in extreme poverty. For instance, someone holding $18,000 of Glo generates up to $432 of basic income per year. For someone living in extreme poverty, this is sufficient to buy 80m2 of farm land, or the materials to build a house. The Glo App gives users a sharable personal impact page and helps consumers that are not crypto-savvy to start participating in donationless philanthropy through the “Choose a path” feature. We’ll integrate Stellar so Stellar wallets can be connected to the Glo App. We’ll also include a Stellar route to the “Choose a path” feature.

Issuance, treasury, and attestations

The Glo Foundation has chosen Brale, Inc to serve as the issuer of the Glo Dollar. Brale is a registered Money Services Business and a licensed money transmitter in the US. Brale manages the fiat reserves, composed of cash & cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasuries, and supports 1:1 minting and redemption from and to USDC and USD. Monthly reserve attestations are published on brale.xyz/stablecoins/USDGLO. These will be independent third-party attestations from November onwards.

Liquidity and on/off-ramping

We'll initially deploy $100,000 of USDC/USDGLO liquidity on StellarX to support retail adoption. This $100K will be continually rebalanced by our partnering market maker; i.e. there will always be $100K Glo Dollar available. For companies, eligible U.S. entities can mint and redeem arbitrarily large amounts of Glo Dollar with Brale, so they have access to ""infinite liquidity"". Non-US entities can use OTC desk 1Konto. If initial adoption goes well, we can start growing liquidity to larger amounts to support heavier use cases. Depending on adoption and demand, it may additionally be fruitful to support other trading pairs such as XLM/USDGLO.

Overview of products, users and involved parties

To summarize: Glo Foundation brings Glo Dollar (USDGLO) to Stellar using Brale. Our market maker deploys $100K USDGLO / USDC to the Stellar DEX.

We have a much more detailed technical document available at the link above; but for your convenience have tried to condense it to the most important points here. We still encourage you to read our full technical document which will be the basis for our activation award and which will be further refined to perfection during the first 6 week period.

CDP Smart Contract Logic:

Product Description: We’re developing a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) system on Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform. This MVP will enable users to engage with a USD-pegged stablecoin system using XLM as collateral.

Problem and Solution: The product addresses the need for a decentralized stablecoin on the Stellar network, providing users with a mechanism to leverage their XLM holdings without selling. This serves the audience seeking to maintain exposure to their crypto assets while accessing liquid capital.

Benefits:
- Accessibility: Users gain access to stablecoins without relinquishing their XLM holdings.
- Stability: Offers a hedge against volatility in the crypto market.
- Decentralization: Ensures transparency and trustlessness, key tenets of the blockchain community.

How it Works and Uses Stellar/Soroban:
- Open/Close Functions: Users interact with the smart contract to lock XLM and mint a stablecoin. The reverse process extinguishes the stablecoin and returns the XLM.
- Interest Calculation: Utilizes a predetermined formula to calculate the interest owed over time on the minted stablecoin.
- Collateralization Ratios: Sets parameters for the amount of XLM required to mint stablecoins, ensuring the system remains solvent even during market downturns.

This first phase includes a full definition of technical details and a version 1 of the Soroban-based smart contracts, ensuring the foundation of the CDP system is solid, functional, and ready for further development.

Future Phases:

Interface and Monitoring (Phase 2):

Product Description: This phase involves developing a user-friendly interface and monitoring system to manage CDPs. The goal is to provide a transparent view of the user's collateral status and potential liquidation scenarios.

Problem and Solution: CDP management can be complex and opaque. A dedicated UI and monitoring tools simplify the experience and help users make informed decisions to prevent liquidation.

Benefits:
- User Empowerment: Empowers users with real-time information on their CDPs.
- Risk Mitigation: Early warning systems for approaching liquidation thresholds help users act promptly to secure their positions.

How it Works and Uses Stellar/Soroban:
- UI: Allows for direct interaction with the Soroban smart contracts, letting users open, monitor, and close CDPs.
- Monitoring Tools: These tools observe the smart contracts and alert users about their CDP status, using off-chain processes until on-chain oracles are available.

Deployment and Testing (Phase 2 + 3):

Product Description: Deployment and testing will likely happen both in phase 2 and phase 3. First we focus on deploying the smart contracts to the testnet for rigorous testing, followed by a security audit before mainnet deployment, during phase 3.

Problem and Solution: Deploying untested smart contracts can lead to security vulnerabilities. Testnet deployment and audits ensure the security and robustness of the contracts.

Benefits:
- Security Assurance: A thorough audit process minimizes the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.
- Reliability: Testnet trials under varied conditions ensure the system's resilience.

How it Works and Uses Stellar/Soroban:
- Testnet Testing: Tests the smart contracts on the Soroban testnet, which simulates the live environment without risking real funds.
- Security Audits: Independent audits assess the smart contracts' security, ensuring they adhere to best practices and are ready for mainnet deployment.

Governance and Multi-Asset Pool Expansion: (Phase 3)

Product Description: The final stage will also see the plan for transition to a DAO for decentralized governance and the introduction of multi-asset pools to the CDP system.

Problem and Solution: Centralized governance is often seen as a bottleneck for innovation and community involvement. Transitioning to a DAO democratizes decision-making and ownership. Multi-asset pools will diversify the assets within the DeFi ecosystem.

Benefits:
- Decentralized Control: A DAO structure ensures the community drives the CDP system's evolution.
- Diversification: Multi-asset pools offer users more options to engage with the system, increasing its robustness and appeal.

How it Works and Uses Stellar/Soroban:
- DAO: Implements governance smart contracts on Soroban, allowing token holders to propose and vote on changes.
- Multi-Asset Pools: Extends the CDP system's capabilities on Soroban to accommodate various assets, enriching the Stellar DeFi landscape.",,,https://github.com/OrbitCDP,,https://vimeo.com/881536539?share=copy,,,,,,,"Ishan Singh, Robin Olthuis",,,,,

Connecting blockchains, securing assets, and enabling interoperability with our cutting-edge cross-chain bridge solution.

Problem: 6.7+ million DeFi users face endless hurdles daily: wasting time and money on high fees for asset swaps across multiple chains using several CEXs, searching for better rates, dealing with limited liquidity on Dexs and lack of interoperability.

Solution: Cutting-edge cross-chain application that enables seamless and secure token swapping across all blockchains with guaranteed high liquidity and thorough security auditing for every added chain.

How it works: The whole application consists of 5 entities: gateway, signer, bridge, connectors, and smart contracts. Gateway is responsible for validating requests from users and transmitting them to the bridge. Bridge is a central processing unit. It processes transfer requests by validating and configuring the transfer approach and then redirecting them to appropriate connectors. Connector is responsible for transaction estimation, events reading, and contract methods calling. Signer signs transactions.

The Bridge operates in two ways:
Liquidity Pools: When users send tokens through our Bridge, we lock the tokens on the source chain and transfer an equivalent amount (minus commission) from the Vault to the user on the destination chain.
Mint/Burn: This method is similar to Liquidity Pools, but it allows us to mint tokens on the destination chain or burn tokens on the source chain.

For example, when transferring LINK tokens from Ethereum to Concordium, we lock them in an Ethereum contract. On Concordium, we mint CLINK tokens equivalent to the locked LINK tokens. To return CLINK tokens to Ethereum, we simply burn them to unlock the original LINK tokens.

User experience: User wants to transfer 5 USDC from Avalanche to ETH network. User fills in all necessary fields in the application. Gateway validates those fields and transmits them to a bridge. Bridge estimates this transfer and constructs a signature via the appropriate connector and returns it via gateway to the user. User sends bridge-in transaction. Connector sends an event of a successful transaction to the bridge and bridge initiates outbound transaction via the appropriate connector. Outbound connector constructs bridge-out transaction, signs it via Signer, and sends it into the blockchain, then caches the event of a successful transaction, sends it to the bridge. Then Bridge updates transfer status. Transferring approach (liquidity pool or wrap/unwrap) depends on token settings in the selected network.

Our cross-chain bridge solution supports both EVM and Non-EVM chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Binance Chain, Casper, Concordium, and also supports USDC stable coin. Already has been audited by Halborn. We are currently working on the Concordium audit, after which we will go live.

We're going to create Soroban smart contract and deploy it to Stellar network to have bridging functionality between networks.",,,https://tricorn.network/,https://github.com/BoostyLabs/tricorn,https://vimeo.com/880111776?share=copy,,,,,,,Elena,,,,,

Currently, you can experiment 🧐 the current version in Testnet at https://soroswap.finance 🖥. Thanks to SCF, we've achieved a user-friendly experience, offering functional Pair, Factory, Library, and Router Contracts. All our code is available on https://github.com/soroswap/, and comprehensive documentation can be found at https://docs.soroswap.finance/.

From our collaboration experiences and participation in other ecosystem’s conferences, we have identified 3 areas of enhancement for this SCF round:

1. Optimal Routing and AMM Aggregator: Leverage Mercury Indexer to calculate optimal routing within Soroswap as well as an optimal split of swaps between other ecosystem participants and Stellar Classic DEX.
2. Bridge Integration: Explore ecosystem’s bridges with other ecosystems to offer users the possibility to bring their Liquidity into Soroban in one platform.
3. More information to the user: Leverage Mercury Indexer to enhance user information and create a user’s dashboard with Liquidity Pool and Stellar Asset information. Work with a UX agency.

To achieve these goals, the Soroswap.Finance team will continue with its commitment to contribute to the Soroban ecosystem by providing 100% open-source code for all our deliverables.

In the following, we explain each of these areas:

1. 🔀 Optimal Routing: We will implement the Mercury Indexer 🌟 to monitor all pair reserves. We will create an optimization algorithm that calculates the most efficient route within Soroswap. This will enhance the existing Router Contract.
   - 💡 What does this solve?: It addresses token swaps in situations where no direct pair exists, or when there is low liquidity by determining the best possible path.

2. 🎛 AMM Aggregator: We will implement the Mercury Indexer 🌟 to track and monitor other ecosystem AMMs and DEXes like Comet ☄️, Phoenix 🦩, the Stellar Classic DEX, and Orderbook to combine and optimize trades to find the best prices and liquidity. It allows splitting swaps across multiple routes.
   - 💡 What does this solve?: Solves the low liquidity problem and liquidity split in various protocols. Thanks to the low transaction fees in Stellar, we could find the optimal trade even if the liquidity is divided across protocols.

3. 🌉 Bridges Exploration: We will explore existing bridges to offer easy cross-blockchain swaps. Deliverable: POC integration of one bridge.
   - 🤔 Which bridge?: From our participation in the sub0 2023 Polkadot Conference, we have been in contact with developers in the Pendulum / Amplitude (parachains in Polkadot / Kusama) team and other players in the Polkadot Ecosystem. We will explore the Skywalk (bridge that Pendulum has developed between Stellar and Polkadot (https://pendulumchain.org/spacewalk). As a strategy for Soroban, Pendulum is very important because it is also focused on offering financial services using stablecoins to businesses and fintech companies. And it’s very focused on forex.
   - Another Bridge that we will explore is AllBridge, specifically its bridge with Ethereum due to its high Liquidity of the aeUSDC token in Stellar.
   - 💡 What does this solve?: Easy onboarding into Soroban DeFi products for other ecosystem players. This together with the on/off ramp exploration could solve a cash-out problem for people in Polkadot and Ethereum.
   - 🧘🏽‍♀️ What audience? New DeFi users from the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems.

4. 📊 More information to the user: Leverage Mercury 🌟 Indexer to create a user’s dashboard, Liquidity Pool, and Stellar Asset information. In order to achieve this, we will continue our collaboration with the LitCollective UX and Design agency. We are going to show last trades (value, token amount, account, link to explorer), TVL info for each Liquidity pool, expected APY, Volume, and more.
   - 💡 What does this solve?: It overcomes the information deficit for informed investment decision-making. This solution also improves data accessibility, transparency, and the user experience within the Stellar ecosystem.

For all, Soroswap.Finance is committed to continue contributing to the Soroban ecosystem by providing 100% open-source code. All that we will do will be documented and shared with the community.",,,https://soroswap.finance/,https://github.com/soroswap/,https://github.com/soroswap/,,,,,,,Esteban Felipe Iglesias Manríquez,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/soroswap/,https://twitter.com/soroswap,https://discord.gg/JdTz2Tbd,
FX Swap by Hedgehog,SCF #21,FX Swap by Hedgehog,FX Swap by Hedgehog,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec5LpAd2YYGkMTnZ,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$42450.00,$42450.00,353073.30,12/19/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,An efficient and alternative way of foreign currency borrowing or investing. ,"Note: Please see the full technical breakdown here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNQ0fvvWQWWsRDAp3SXQ3rW9sJgMGHhN/view

Hedgehog brings Foreign Currency (FX) Swaps to the Soroban ecosystem. FX Swaps can hedge the value of an existing investment against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as parties benefitting from each others’ access to better loan rates.

This solution:
1. Includes the creation of an Oracle to keep track of the forward rates of various currencies.
2. Acts as a hedging solution for entities wanting to invest or borrow in foreign currency.
3. Is eligible for hedge accounting, as the Far Leg of the FX Swap is an eligible hedging instrument under IFRS 9.

Consider two parties who desire one currency now but want to swap back in the future to the original currency, e.g. One party wants USDC but has EURC, and another party has USDC but wants EURC.

One scenario is when investors can benefit by accessing foreign currency loans at a better rate. USDC holders may be able to take out a EUR loan at a rate of 5%, but they can take out a USD loan at a rate of 3%. EURC holders may be in a similar situation, being able to take out a USD loan at a rate of 5% but an EUR loan at 3%.

By entering into an FX swap agreement, both parties can benefit from the other’s interest rate (the EURC holders get EUR at a better rate, while the USDC holders get USD at a better rate and loan them in return) and swap back the principal at the maturity of the agreement.

The second scenario is to leverage currency swaps to reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates by taking a hedging position. If they suffered a loss due to fluctuating exchange rates affecting their original purpose for operating in a foreign currency, the profit on the swap can offset it.

In TradFi, these agreements are typically done between two parties; by leveraging the power of Soroban and DeFi, Hedgehog can create FX Swaps between pools of investors on both sides so that multiple USDC holders can enter a contract with multiple EURC holders.

An oracle is required because exchanges happen at the spot rate, but the deals are closed at the forward rate. The forward points are the interest rate differential between the two currencies.

Please note Hedgehog will initially operate with well-established and trusted Stablecoins such as USDC, EURC and AUDD.

This is the first of a series of smart contracts to constitute the basis for a hedging financial protocol on Soroban.",,,https://www.hedgeeffective.com/hedgehog,,https://www.loom.com/share/ba8b13ba4c46490fafe8beb2c7117f69?sid=c33976a1-4419-491b-87a5-1eeaf8b85c22,,,,,,,Kevin Paul Mitchell,,,,,

We are a social Fintech for migrants based on a Super App with transactional functionalities (remittance sending) and a service aggregation marketplace that allows migrant workers to pay directly for services for their families such as Airtime.

Pivot from traditional rails to building a Stellar SEP31 Anchor: We now want to build our payment infrastructure on top of Stellar in order to improve time-to-money for our clients as well as reduce the fees that are involved in this process when using traditional rails, for both the customers and the company. As a regulated company, we are in the perfect position to build a SEP-31 Anchor that will allow users to send bank-to-bank transfers seamlessly while everything runs on Stellar Infrastructure on the back. The SEP-31 Anchor allows us to directly connect with the already existing anchor in Latin America (starting with Colombia and the Dominican Republic) and directly off-ramp the funds into the Fiat bank accounts of the receivers in these countries. This Stellar Payment Infrastructure infrastructure will allow both ends of the remittance transaction to engage with bank-to-bank transfers seamlessly, while the transactions are settled in a matter of seconds and at a fraction of the cost.

The Circle EURC launch on Stellar has been determined in order to activate this process for us as we can now directly mint EURC on Stellar from Europe. Our clients can pay with a variety of different options (Card Payments and Direct Bank Account Payments) which are received in our custody account and sent over to the Circle custody Account for the minting of the equivalent EURC amount.

Fiat Pay-In: As a regulated entity that is already operating, we already offer various options for our clients to pay directly on our app. We can accept any card in Europe and are already working on expanding this to direct debit bank payments, maximizing the number of options for our clients. These funds fall directly into our custody operational account.

Circle EURC Minting: After receiving the funds from the clients, we directly send them over to our Circle Business Account using the SEPA payment network, which allows us to mint the equivalent EUROC amount in a matter of seconds.

Off-Ramping and Settlement Colombia (Anclap): a platform within the Stellar network that specializes in off-ramping for financial institutions in Colombia. This partnership ensures that Aura Pay can meet stringent regulatory requirements and maintain a secure and compliant operation.

Off-Ramping and Settlement Dominican Republic (Alfred): a platform within the Stellar network that specializes in off-ramping for financial institutions in the Dominican Republic. This partnership ensures that Aura Pay can meet stringent regulatory requirements and maintain a secure and compliant operation.

B2C Wallet Infrastructure: On our App, Aura Pay is also developing a wallet at the moment to move away from the purely transactional model that exists nowadays and allow migrant workers to directly hold their funds in a wallet that also enables them to directly send to their families back home. The SEP-31 Anchor will also allow customers to directly fund this wallet with Fiat from Spain.

All in all, by using the Stellar network, Aura Pay is able to optimize cross-border payment operations, reducing the time to money and cost of the transfers for both our clients and ourselves, allowing us to provide a much better service and become a more efficient company.",docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nFwbZTRoi- DehLvcskZ0vUoFPfxYeHHJaUNzuu35zwo/edit,,https://somosaurapay.com/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0o4YjnfFv0&feature=youtu.be,,,,,,,Sebastian Barrera,,,,,
Emigro,SCF #20,Emigro Launch,Emigro,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec3V2931dtXFcoML,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$33920.00,$33920.00,282149.40,11/14/2023,Legacy v5.0 Community Award,"Emigro is the stablecoin-based, card-less digital payments wallet for digital nomads, long-term travelers and expats in LatAm.","Emigro is a pair of self-custody mobile app wallets for the tourism industry, one targeted at international travelers, and the other at small and medium sized tourism vendors located in Brazil. The vendor app will generate a dynamic QR code containing the vendor details and the details of the payment requested. The consumer app will be able to scan QR codes and approve payments. Both apps will have fiat on/off ramp capability, with path payments between them, currency swaps and sponsored fees. While the apps will have a different focus for the front-end functionality, they'll share a back-end. The functionality will mimic traditional fintech apps such as Revolut and NuBank, with no initial focus on the broader crypto industry.

Brazil was chosen as the initial market because it has a large international tourism industry and a new national instant payment method was introduced in 2020 that foreigners can't easily access to make local payments. This payment method, called Pix, was created by the Central Bank to connect all major banks and financial products in Brazil for consumers and businesses in an instant and low-cost way. Early 2023, two years from launch, Pix had grabbed 35% of all payments market share, which is on par with debit and credit cards combined, who lost 5% share in this time to Pix. Pix is so successful that other LatAm countries, such as Colombia and Chile, are looking to replicate it. Emigro will be an international version of Pix, focusing on cross-border C2B and B2B payments, connecting the best fiat on/off ramp methods directly from bank accounts.

Pix is a Brazilian system and foreign travelers to Brazil can't easily access it, which can cause difficulties as it's becoming so widely used that vendors would prefer to accept it over cash or foreign credit cards, which they pay 3-7% in fees to accept. This is creating a situation where long-term tourists and digital nomads are having difficulties in making local payments and keeping their costs down, without becoming a tax resident of Brazil and opening a local bank account. They want to start using Pix, but are essentially blocked from gaining access.

Luckily, the Brazilian Central Bank is very fintech and crypto-friendly and Stellar anchors can be created that can access Pix. This allows Stellar-based wallets to easily get access to the Brazilian market with payments in a cost-effective and instant method. The challenge then is to gain acceptance in the market, which has been my focus while the tech is being built.

There are many opportunities to expand the product and use Soroban, but I need to get the product going in the market first. Other Stellar-based products have access to or operate within Brazil, but Emigro is the sole product focused on the use-case of foreigners making local payments in Brazil as the starting point. A direct relationship with Transfero, (BRZ on Stellar), is being established to solidify Emigro's place in the Brazil market.",drive.google.com/file/d/1DDk6jijWQePDgJa6k9eFt1fqWghBvzFq/view,,https://emigro.co,https://github.com/EmigroBR,https://www.loom.com/share/175651d33eee45f49d008daf5f9c8441?sid=f76e94ef-f309-4b25-99f8-e35408e63a69,,,,,,,Blake William Sieders,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/emigro-inc/,https://twitter.com/emigrobr,,

Through an easy-to-use API platform, remittance-receiving financial institutions can directly embed into their app a checkout widget allowing clients to compliantly top-up their home-country wallets and bank accounts with their local currency. Our service allows Financial Institutions (FIs) to serve migrant workers, eliminating the need to depend on third-party remittance companies to send and receive funds.

We empower migrant workers by providing them with the ability to bank directly in their home country. This unlocks a far better experience by significantly reducing fees, making funds available instantly, and allowing them to directly participate in the local economy. They can easily send funds to loved ones and local service providers, giving them more control over their finances and enhancing their overall financial well-being. This creates a huge amount of opportunities for local financial institutions as the API solutions allow them to maximize their customer deposits and get direct access to one of the highest-earning customer segments in remittance-receiving countries, overseas migrant workers.

Borderless is the first Stellar solution connecting real-time rails to enable instant money movement across the globe. We utilize stablecoin infrastructure and the SDEX to connect independent real-time local payment schemes and gross-settlement systems (SEPA, FedNow, RTR, etc.) with local payment rails in remittance-receiving countries. This allows for a seamless experience for the customer, where they pay in and receive fiat currency, while the Stellar blockchain and Stablecoins allow for an instant movement of money between the FIs at the lowest cost, in near real-time and without FX slippage.

1. Fiat Pay-in: We integrate acquirers and payment initiators in every market to accept card payments and local real-time rails, allowing FIs to maximize acceptance rates and reduce pay-in costs.

2. Stablecoin Minting: Upon receiving payment confirmation, Borderless directly mints the equivalent Stablecoin amount (QCAD, USDC, EURC ...) through existing ecosystem infrastructure (Circle and Stablecorp).

3. USDC Consolidation: To increase compatibility with most SEP-31 offramping anchors, Borderless consolidates all collected currencies in USDC. This is carried out directly on the SDEX to obtain real-time and non-intermediated FX – while offering non-relevant slippage.

4. Settlement and Off-Ramping: USDC amount is automatically sent to an off-ramping anchor in the destination countries (PDAX in The Philippines). At last, it directly deposits the funds into the Financial Institution's custody account in fiat currency.

Utilizing the Stellar protocol, Borderless is able to carry out this four-step process in a matter of seconds, at a negligible cost, and avoiding large prefunding requirements – allowing FIs to pass these savings on to their customers.",docs.google.com/document/d/1QivMZeF8X7MiClBGjkU59eKpsBPVpJtGhwF1hsnzvJA/edit,,https://borderless-6bc6f5.webflow.io/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GFA4czBe6Q,,,,,,,Alvaro Martinez Esteban,,,,,
DeRisk,SCF #20,DeRisk - Monitoring DeFi risks,DeRisk,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recWVVLF0ufdI0y0Z,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,375968.10,11/6/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,DeRisk is a risk monitoring platform that serves as an “early warning” mechanism to detect risky situations for lending protocols.,"DeRisk is a risk monitoring platform that serves as an “early warning” mechanism to detect risky situations for lending protocols.

Benefits:
- Allows lending protocols to put measures in place to protect themselves and their users.
- Allows for a more efficient capital allocation and more capital flowing instead of being stuck in liquidity pools.
- Having DeRisk on Stellar will decrease the chances of acquiring bad debt in the whole ecosystem, which will be an incentive for projects to build on Stellar.
- Standardization of loans will lead to easier chain wide liquidations.

DeFi protocols, DEXes and users all have one thing in common. They want to make money, not lose money. If bad debt is acquired by a lending protocol, it’s a big problem not only for that specific lending protocol but even for the rest of projects in the chain. The inherent volatility of the crypto market means that things can go south in a matter of minutes. The liquidity pools can dry up very fast and some loans may not be possible to be liquidated profitably. To solve this problem, lending protocols need to have allocated a large amount of capital “just in case”, which implies having a large amount of capital stuck in their security pools, which means a high cost of capital for the DeFi protocols, and a lot less capital flowing in the whole ecosystem. Other lending protocols have it worse, they can’t allocate such cushioned, “just in case” liquidity pools, which makes it risky for the borrowers.

DeRisk monitors lending protocols and loans and compares them against available capital on DEXes, and liquidators' smart contracts and makes it very easy to detect loans with higher risk of becoming underwater. To illustrate, consider a protocol that has lent ~$15mil worth of tokens while available capital on DEXes is just above $10mil. This situation poses a considerable risk not only to that protocol, but to other lending protocols and the broader DeFi ecosystem.

This monitoring results in a powerful early warning system that benefits the entire ecosystem. Part of DeRisk is also the possibility to compare lending protocols and to see individual loans with a risk of being liquidated and the loan history.

Our high level company goal is to “Take care of risk on chain” and we want to do that for everyone. Thanks to Stellar’s market positioning we can reach the user base that we would be able to elsewhere. DeRisk platform is for us the first step in bringing other projects we do elsewhere to Stellar. Particularly Carmine Options AMM and hedging and insurance built on top of that, which could massively leverage the on-ramp solutions combined with following regulations.

In this application it is the DeRisk platform and in particular the early warning system for lending protocols that watches for risk of under the water loans. The risk of under the water loans is not the only thing we are working on the DeRisk platform, we will be adding monitoring and early warning systems for other DeFi risks and we have under development BI that could be easily used by DeFi (and other) protocols.

The DeRisk platform is an entry solution that will be followed by Carmine Options AMM and risk and hedging products built on top of it. For example insurance against drop of value of crypto assets that will result in higher liquidity of user assets, hedging against impermanent loss, insurance against under the water loans and more.

We are also building governance solution that will be plug and play solution for protocols from early governance days, through help in listing protocol tokens to token distribution. Essentially resulting in projects focusing on building the important core and not something that someone else has already done. This together with the BI and risk monitoring will reduce the cost and mainly time to build and deliver new projects on Stellar.",docs.google.com/document/d/1fg72POTJh7PXw- _q0Muc_7rjgylW82lkJSSxUZ8uxw4/edit,,https://derisk.carmine.finance,https://github.com/CarmineOptions/derisk-research/,https://vimeo.com/874433482,,,,,,,Marek Hauzr,,,,,

The admin account of the oracle smart contract always has all node public keys as co-signers with >50% multisig threshold, so more than half of the oracle backing nodes have to agree on a transaction in order to store price feed data or modify oracle contract state.

Each node independently calculates the values of quoted prices using deterministic idempotent algorithms to ensure consistency, generates the update transaction, signs it with the node's private key, and shares it with other peer nodes via WebSocket protocol. If for some reason (ledger access delay, failing connection, version incompatibility, adversary attack) any given node quotes a token/asset price different from other nodes, the transaction hash will not match the hash generated by the majority, so the transaction won't make it into the ledger. This way Reflector utilizes Stellar protocol underlying security to implement an uncomplicated yet robust consensus, which guarantees reliability, fault tolerance, and regular price feed updates.

For on-chain Stellar assets price feed data retrieval, Reflector relies on a quorum of nodes connected to Stellar validators. Each node fetches trades information directly from the Stellar Core database. Price feeds for generic tokens get updated in a similar fashion, but nodes have to agree on information pulled from external sources (CEX/DEX API, price aggregators, stock exchanges, derivative platforms, etc.).

Other contracts interact with the oracle contract, retrieving data stored by Reflector nodes. Consumers can fetch historical ranges, use cross-price calculation, utilize TWAP averaging, or simply pull the most recent token price depending on the use-case. Check practical examples.

Components:
- Reflector node: Fetches prices, maintains p2p communication with other nodes, and publishes price updates signed by the quorum.
- Oracle smart contract: Contract implementation that incorporates consumer-facing interface with admin functionality.
- Contract JavaScript bindings: Provides convenient JS wrappers for interaction with the contract from JS runtime.
- Stellar Core DB connector: Database connector library responsible for retrieving and parsing data from Stellar Core.

DIA Oracles,SCF #20,DIA Oracles on Soroban,DIA Oracles,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recQH7t1KOVb8jBOH,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$38000.00,$38000.00,316745.90,11/15/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,"Elevate functionality and innovation across Soroban’s smart contract ecosystem with DIA’s robust, open-source cross-chain oracles","Product: Integration of DIA Price Oracles on Soroban

DIA is a cross-chain oracle provider, while Soroban is a developer-friendly smart contracts platform built on Rust and designed to scale. While at its core, Soroban is a smart contracts platform which enables the building and deployment of diverse and innovative decentralized applications (dApps), Layer 1 blockchains are inherently limited in their ability to connect dApps to external data.

Due to this limitation, dApps on Soroban and other Layer 1 blockchains are dependent on oracles to deliver such data to smart contracts. This external data is often essential to the functionality of smart contracts, and without it many different types of dApps would not be able to function.

Some examples of dApps which are reliant on oracles include lending protocols, money markets, synthetic assets issuers, derivatives, options and futures markets, collateralized stablecoins, prediction markets, randomness consuming applications, and many more.

The Solution: DIA Price Oracles

DIA is a cross-chain oracle provider that enhances data transparency, customization, and accessibility. With a unique architecture that aggregates raw trade data directly from first-party sources, namely centralized and decentralized exchanges, DIA offers 100% source transparency and bespoke customization.

This enables the provision of price oracles for over 2,500 cryptocurrency tokens, 18,000+ NFT collections, Liquid Staked Tokens, and more, with the ability to customize each feed for specific protocols and use cases.

DIA’s oracles have played a key role in driving innovation and growth for dApps on 38 layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain networks, and have proven to be an integral component to the success of many thriving blockchain ecosystems.

What Problems DIA Solves and the Benefits:

Data Transparency: Different from other oracles, DIA’s architecture is unique in that data is sourced on a first-party level, directly from 80+ centralized and decentralized exchanges, instead of relying on premium data providers. This sourcing methodology enables end-to-end, 100% transparency about the origin of data on the individual exchange level, solving the issue of data opaqueness and providing Soroban smart contract developers and users with complete transparency about their data sources.

Learn more about DIA’s data sourcing here.

Data Customization: DIA's granular data scraping enables the creation of tailor-made data feeds to meet the specific needs of each dApp on Soroban. This solves the problem of one-size-fits-all data feeds and allows developers to customize the parameters of their oracle including data sources, data cleansing filters, pricing and computational methodologies, update mechanisms and more.

This customizability has proven essential in fostering innovation, as DIA oracles are able to uniquely cater to different dApp needs, thus supporting a wider array of dApps and use cases.

Support for More Assets than Traditional Oracles: DIA's ability to construct price feeds for crypto assets traded on any of DIA’s supported DEXs and CEX’s, so long as they meet DIAs liquidity, volume, and sources criteria, addresses the problem of limited data availability for less commonly traded assets.

This benefits Soroban users by expanding the range of supported assets on the network.

Cross-Chain Asset Support: Many ecosystem-native assets face limitations in cross-chain functionality due to inadequate oracle support, hindering their utility beyond their original ecosystem.

DIA overcomes this challenge by placing emphasis on sourcing asset price data from decentralized exchanges, expanding support for a broader range of ecosystem-native assets not covered by centralized exchanges.

For instance, when a dApp community introduces a token and lists it on AMM-style decentralized exchanges, DIA can support these tokens once they meet specified liquidity and volume criteria, and further their cross-chain capabilities by providing price oracles for these assets across the 38 other blockchains which DIA is integrated with.

This will ultimately provide significant value and create cross-chain functionality for assets which trade on Soroban’s decentralized exchanges.

How DIA Works:

DIA boasts a modular architecture, engineered for comprehensive data coverage across a multitude of sources, asset price feeds, and supported blockchains. This architecture is composed of three integral components: Collection, Computation, and Publication. DIA currently supports 38 blockchain networks.

Collection: At the heart of DIA is the data collection system, a mechanism that fetches granular market data from a broad range of on-chain and off-chain exchanges, including Centralized Exchanges, Decentralized Exchanges, and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces, amongst others. Through the availability of billions of trades, DIA enables the creation of resilient, high-confidence price feeds.

Data sourcing at DIA is accomplished through exchange scrapers, developed by both DIA and an ever-growing community of contributors. These scrapers are integral in the creation of price feeds for assets across all networks – there is no reliance on third-party premium data providers.

Computation: DIA employs transparent computational methodologies to process raw trade data into reliable feeds. From outlier cleansing filters to sophisticated pricing techniques, DIA can support diverse requirements.

From developing straightforward Time-Weighted Volume Average Price (TWVAP) asset price feeds to crafting complex, use-case-specific price feeds, DIA capabilities are comprehensive.

Publication: Upon the creation of a price feed, it is published via API endpoint. This data feed then gets pushed on-chain, wrapped in oracle smart contracts. DIA’s decentralized network of nodes takes on the responsibility of pushing oracle data on-chain, currently servicing 38 major L1/L2 blockchains.

DIA Integration with Soroban:

DIA’s oracle smart contracts are deployed natively on each chain in the DIA ecosystem, in this case Soroban, thus mitigating any reliance on external bridges or messaging protocols. This significantly improves the resilience of DIA oracles against counterparty bridging risk, as well as removes any bridge-related latency.

In summary, the integration of DIA oracles with Soroban will enhance data accessibility, transparency, customizability, and implement support for a wide range of assets in Soroban's smart contracts. The outcome will empower developers on Soroban to construct more reliable and flexible decentralized applications, all of which depend on accurate and verifiable oracle pricing. This integration will be beneficial to the entire Soroban community, including developers and users, by providing them with a robust foundation for building, executing, and benefiting from blockchain applications on the Soroban network.",docs.diadata.org/introduction/dia-technical-structure,,https://www.diadata.org/,https://github.com/diadata-org/,https://youtu.be/AL1uN3-zWuE,,,,,,,Dillon Hanson,,,,,

Designed to help users navigate across the Stellar ecosystem with ease, 24/7.&nbsp;","Stroopy.ai is a helpful Stellar guide that includes a chatbot with social media integrations. The purpose is to answer any questions about the Stellar ecosystem, educate newcomers, help with troubleshooting or guidance, and be a virtual 24/7 assistant for the Stellar community. The intended goal is to onboard users to Stellar fast, facilitate engagement instantly, and provide robust community support seamlessly.

Social media integrations will be implemented to increase the outreach and visibility of the Stellar blockchain via the chatbot onto platforms such as Reddit and X(Twitter). By answering correct and validated questions on social media platforms, we can ensure not only the inquirer will benefit from the valuable information, but also future readers.

Stroopy.ai Features: Activation Award Roadmap: (first batch to be completed in Dec 2023). An open-source Knowledge base of the Stellar ecosystem and partners with a custom-trained LLM created, code interpreter to assist in code development, multilingual support (showcased in video), troubleshooting capabilities (stellar-core, horizon, ecosystem wallets, exchanges, etc), and Reddit & X(Twitter) integrations. Future roadmap includes: Interacting with the blockchain and providing live analytical data about the network, full Soroban integration (auditing, fuzz testing, etc), Discord & Telegram integrations, and ChatGPT plugin.

What problems does it solve? It lowers the barrier of entry for users to learn about Stellar and to engage with a resourceful entity as quickly as possible. All you need to do is to go onto the chatbot webpage (https://stroopy.ai) to start asking questions or copy/pasting their problem. On social media (Reddit or X), a user can @tag the chatbot and get a response to a question or statement, which will then promote Stellar content naturally. No more bad experiences from wasting time researching endlessly and coming up with outdated information. Onboarding will be as easier than ever.

But wait, another chatgpt chatbot? Not exactly! ChatGPT (free version is stuck on Sept 2021 - paid version is stuck on Jan 2022) is still stuck in 2021/2022 and therefore does not know of any new information such as MoneyGram or the latest features on the Beans app. It can't properly educate users on Soroban or inform them on the newest SEP and CAP updates. In fact, the current testing preview on https://stroopy.ai is simply a showcase of what ChatGPT can currently do (please test it out and see the limitations for yourself for this is the reason why a custom LLM is required)!

Stroopy.ai vs other chatbots: Most chatbots are usually trained on specific training docs or simple FAQs and therefore their sole purpose is to be a co-pilot for developers or a specific application. Stroopy.ai is entirely designed from the ground up to be a sole assistant for the Stellar community to help with all their needs instantly and accurately, whether they're coders, builders, enthusiasts, investors, newcomers, and everyone else in between.

Current Limitations and Solutions Required: With the current limitations of ChatGPT and misinformation on the web that perpetuates future confusion for web crawling bots, the only true solution is the creation of an updated knowledge base with information encompassing the entire Stellar ecosystem. By connecting the most cutting edge chatbot technology to the updated knowledge base, we can unlock a very sophisticated AI assistant that can help in a plethora of situations for Stellar members, old or new.

In Summary: With updated and correct information (crawlers routinely being maintained and updated every month to upload new data into the chatbot), the creation of an AI assistant that can answer questions 24/7 will fundamentally change the course of the social media presence of Stellar by constantly producing relevant and informative content directly to those who are inquiring about it. Once a user has used the assistant in order to learn about Stellar, they're more likely to continue learning about it and share to others - the first part of the end goal of onboarding users seamlessly is achieved. As Stroopy.ai leaves answers on social media conversations to help users with their questions, it will in turn also help other readers who will come across the same situation. For example, if a user asks about the best wallets to use on Stellar right now, the list of wallets will not only help that user but any other readers that would have been curious of what wallets to use, therefore increasing visibility and outreach - the second part of the end goal is achieved.",docs.google.com/document/d/1eCN7_vH433kCFCL9oMgc- HXg6DgRnGp9ki9Ro3AB6iA/edit,,https://stroopy.ai,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueISnI0pjog,,,,,,,Pantheon,,,,,

StellarGPT represents a cutting-edge, multilingual search tool designed specifically for the vast Stellar ecosystem. Despite Stellar's significant reach in regions such as Africa and Asia, its digital presence remains largely in English, presenting a barrier to entry. Addressing this gap, StellarGPT provides a solution, allowing developers to access and understand educational resources in their native languages. Although Stellar offers a wealth of educational content — from YouTube video libraries to Dapps and documentation — few developers can navigate this expanse efficiently. Much of this content, hosted on various platforms, is restricted by the constraints of their discovery algorithms. As the developer community's interest in Web3 grows, Stellar must lead the way with native search solutions spanning its entire ecosystem.

StellarGPT is designed to cover the Stellar Ecosystem's complete digital landscape. This includes YouTube Video Libraries with precision in information extraction and timestamping, Blogs & Documentation enhanced with translations for better comprehension, Dapps making decentralized applications universally accessible to developers, and APIs, Indexes, and a comprehensive online suite of tools. Information retrieval will be multilingual, and users will have the ability to share this knowledge, turning learning into a communal experience.

At its heart, StellarGPT utilizes a hybrid search mechanism that melds indexing with semantic analysis. This model guarantees precision, allowing users to pinpoint the exact content they desire, courtesy of the advanced hybrid techniques. It promotes effortless content sharing, even specific video segments, amongst peers. StellarGPT goes beyond mere search results, directing users to the relevant Stellar online product, simplifying the coding initiation journey.

While the current iteration of StellarGPT emphasizes efficient, multilingual search, our aspirations stretch beyond this initial provision. In future updates, we intend to integrate real-time data, empowering users to execute transactions on the Stellar Networks using intuitive natural language instructions. We also plan to collaborate with LearnQuantum's proprietary technology for generative video, introducing unique generated animations for content.

A ""Finite State Machine (FSM)"" represents a mathematical model employed in various computing domains, including the design and development of Smart Contracts. The KMAC project is a program constructed with the soroban-sdk, which facilitates the implementation of a Finite State Machine template, leveraging well-established design patterns and offering extensible functional capabilities.

Building a Finite State Machine with the soroban-sdk will be an experimentation journey. It's not just about making the open-source machine; it's also about creating clear guides and notes about what I'm doing. I'm going to be actively involved in the Soroban community, sharing what I learn and helping others.

Previous Work: This submission is a post-work derived from a previous submission I made for the “Sorobounty Spectacular”. See here: https://github.com/stellar/sorobounty-spectacular/discussions/15

Why?

Currently, there are limited functional modules created using the soroban-sdk. While there are good examples in the stellar/soroban-examples repository and some community-supported projects, there's still a need for more functional models. Additionally, it's crucial to follow standard design patterns when developing Smart Contracts in the soroban-sdk.

The product is a functional application that provides a template for creating an FSM-style process with additional functionalities. KMAC offers a foundation of components, implemented through a set of administrative security and error-handling functions, following standard design patterns. From a developer's perspective, as KMAC adheres to a modular design, it allows for understanding, exploring, testing, and documenting the design patterns of Smart Contracts implemented with the Soroban SDK.

The KMAC contributions:

The KMAC project will contribute to the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem by:

- Offering a comprehensive open-source Finite State Machine program that will utilize well-established design patterns. This accessible template will simplify the development for the community. KMAC's modular setup will make it easy to study, test, and document design patterns in Smart Contracts created with Soroban SDK.
- Writing good articles and documentation about Soroban design patterns implementation.
- Creation of open-source modules and libraries that will be available to be re-used by other developers in the ecosystem.",github.com/huitemagico/kmac/blob/main/kmac_techArchDoc.pdf,,https://github.com/huitemagico/kmac,https://github.com/huitemagico/kmac,https://youtu.be/pRFLIfLRbw0,,,,,,,Alejandro Iglesias,,,,,

Walletless onboarding

a) What is the problem?
- It is always complex to onboard web2 users to a web3 dapp, because of the requirement to setup a wallet, passphrase to sign transaction and interact with smart contracts.
- Web3 mobile application cannot be built easily due to wallets not being available on mobile devices.
- There is no single-sign on solution, where a user can use the same account for an app from various devices.

b) How is Walletless onboarding solving these problems?
- Walletless onboarding enables Google/GitHub login for users, and sets up their wallet automatically with a password provided by the user, the hassle of maintaining seed backup and requirement of a wallet application is bypassed.
- Because walletless onboarding allows Google/GitHub sign-in, one can develop mobile apps on stellar easily, as the requirement of wallet-application is no longer required.
- The wallet-less onboarding enables one to use the same account on multiple devices and still be able to interact with the dapp.

c) Benefits
- Dapp developers can easily onboard more users, and attract web2 users.
- It becomes easy for dapp users to signup into the dapp.
- Mobile dapps can be built on stellar!

d) How is stellar/soroban used?
- Walletban uses an account abstraction methodology, hence actual wallets for each user are made on the stellar blockchain.

Smart Contract Interaction via REST API

a) What is the problem?
- A dapp developer needs to setup RPC, and must have Soroban SDK dependencies to interact with smart-contract on stellar chain.
- Mismatch of SDK's due to chain upgrade causes downtime to the dapp, and the developers have to manually upgrade the SDK.

b) How is this service solving this problem?
- Dapp developers can get rid of the Soroban SDK dependencies and interact with the smart contract via simple REST APIs!

c) Benefits
- Each platform doesn't need a Soroban SDK, e.g., Soroban SDK does not exist for Kotlin, but one can still develop Stellar Dapp on Kotlin using this service to interact with the chain!
- This enables endless possibilities to create dapps, from terminal apps to IoT devices!

d) How is stellar/soroban used?
- The interactions are done using soroban, and are heavily inspired by how the Soroban CLI works and invokes contracts on the chain.

Launch Stellar Asset Contract Tokens with simple clicks

a) What is the problem?
- Deploying a SAC of your own requires Rust toolchain installed, and need to know Rust to modify and launch your own token.

b) How is this service solving this problem?
- Enables dapp users to launch their own token (SAC) with a simple form and click!

c) Benefits
- Every dapp might require its own tokens to function, and is very essential, walletban allows a dapp developer to deploy their own token with a simple click with no rust toolchain/rust knowledge required!

d) How is stellar/soroban used?

Preventing vulnerabilities and ensuring correct, intended behavior of smart contracts could thus save billions of dollars. The traditional approach to software security and correctness is based on testing and code review, but testing cannot cover all possible inputs and code review often misses problems. Instead, we propose an approach based on formal verification to ensure correctness and security of smart contracts. Formal verification leverages rigorous mathematical proofs to eliminate entire classes of bugs and vulnerabilities, beyond the capabilities of traditional testing. A verified contract will always behave as expected even in the presence of malicious actors, ensuring that it has no bugs or vulnerabilities that could cost millions or even billions of dollars.

The Formal VerSo (Formal Verification of Soroban contracts) project will develop formal verification tooling for Soroban by extending Galois’s Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) with support for verifying smart contracts on the Soroban platform. This will allow users of the Soroban platform to make sure their contracts are correct and secure before deploying them. Galois has decades of experience developing SAW and applying it to perform formal verification, including working with Amazon to formally verify their S2N cryptography library. Galois has recently developed SAW support for formal verification of Rust programs, such as the Rust programs used to write Soroban contracts. This first phase of the Formal VerSo project, for the activation award, will demonstrate how SAW can be used to formally verify simple and small Soroban contracts by treating them as standard Rust programs.

Like Zapier, but for Soroban. ","Satellite

Satellite is a platform that integrates third party app data into Soroban, acting as the gateway between software oracles and smart contracts. Leveraging webhooks, sockets, and polling, our platform receives live updates from user’s third party app accounts and passes the data into smart contracts. These contracts are configured through a simplified UI to pay out participants according to rules the creator sets. The goal of Satellite isn’t to provide full customization of smart contracts, but instead write reusable, robust contracts that cover 90% of use cases. By designing for pre-set, and common, smart contract payout structures, we enable the onboarding of users who have no understanding of the underlying technology. In fact, our end users will likely not know what a smart contract is.

We Work Out

We Work Out is the first end-user application implementing the Satellite platform. Since the first third party software oracle that Satellite will implement is Strava, we will be building a web, iOS, and Android application that enables users to create workout pools. A workout pool is a group of people, or teams, who are either competing or working together to achieve fitness goals, and then receive payouts based on hitting those goals.

For example, a company wants to incentivize employees to walk more, so they create a workout pool with $10,000 that will pay out to all users in their company who walk more than 10 miles per week over the course of three months. Users who join the workout pool connect their Strava account, which automatically enables Satellite support for their workout data, which feeds directly into Soroban. Another example would be a running club that wants to pay out the athlete with the most logged miles in a given month. In the past, this took a lot of manual coordination, but with We Work Out and Satellite, the process is seamless and automatic.

What’s more, the users in the workout group don’t even need to know each other anymore, as Soroban builds a framework for trustless payments; everyone sees the rules for the payouts (based on Strava’s data), and the smart contract programmatically enforces those rules. Minimal administration is required. That is what we call a batteries-included experience.

Satellite Product Road Map

During the development of Satellite, we will be building toolsets that enable us to more quickly integrate third party software oracles. The goal is to build out Satellite as a SaaS/API model, where developers can leverage Satellite to build their own apps (like we did with We Work Out). As we enable more oracles, the possibilities for developers grows dramatically, as does the utility of Soroban and the Stellar Network. We simultaneously envision building a simple REST API and SDKs for Satellite that integrate with popular development frameworks to speed up the development and deployment of smart contracts linked to software oracles.

We Work Out Product Road Map

We Work Out will continue to be our first, and our flagship, implementation of Satellite. We have identified corporate wellness programs as the path to growth and profitability for the platform. By creating a simplified experience for setting up and launching corporate wellness programs that incentivize real activity through real third party data, we leverage tech to offer a non-existent product that can capitalize on the gap in the corporate wellness space.",drive.google.com/file/d/1Gxeh5bUrB9j0xaTBmoHyZqYDVKTEsaZH/view,,https://spaceboat.space/satellite,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7hL-zY0Bs0,,,,,,,Stephen Looney,,,,,

Our proof of concept will enable users to send native ERC20 USDT and receive native Stellar USDC and vice versa. There are no wrapped tokens, and this system will be secure, decentralized, near-instant, low-fee, and trustless.

We will then expand the Ionize Bridge to cover all stable assets with significant supply, and that’s just the beginning. Ionize is a modular and extensible protocol and network, with the cross-chain stable asset system as the first module released.

The longer-term goal is to connect Stellar's exceptional real-world utility and Soroban's scalability and technical excellence to other ecosystems, minimizing barriers for developers and users to move assets and utilize complementary projects.

To put this statement into context, here are a few example modules we would look to develop in the future:

Storage: Enable Stellar XLM/USDC to be used by developers and users to pay for decentralized file storage via chains like Filecoin. A data storage module would have hundreds of uses, including dApps built on Soroban covering notarization to supply chain logistics.

Cross-chain dApps: Make Soroban dApps more accessible by allowing users to transact using assets from other chains; this lowers friction and onboarding barriers and allows existing blockchain users to easily experience the benefits of Stellar & Soroban from their first touchpoint.

Cross-chain Transactions: Alice sends ERC20 USDT, and Bob receives Stellar USDC. Use cases include C2C, B2C, microtransactions, dapp-to-dapp transactions, etc.

So, how does this work?

Ionize is a decentralized network of validators, each running nodes for each supported chain (Horizon + Captive core for Stellar, Geth for Ethereum, and so on).

These nodes also jointly hold balances across all supported chains; we call this the vault. The vault is a multisig wallet, though, in a technical sense, it's somewhat different than the traditional multisig you might be familiar with as we use threshold signatures.

The nodes then also run the core Ionize service, which handles all the main aspects of the system, including spin-up, peer finding, consensus, vault creation & migration, node churn handling, etc.

For those familiar, this is analogous to Tendermint or CometBFT and is Byzantine Fault Tolerant. Thus, it would take control of more than 1/3rd of the network to create a halt and over 2/3rds to attack it. We take security very seriously and incorporate it into all aspects of our system design.

Finally, the nodes run modules that cover the actual feature set of Ionize, with the first module powering our cross-chain stable asset bridge.

Through this, a user can send ERC20 USDT to the Ionize network deposit address with a memo of a target Stellar address, and the Ionize network will then reach a consensus on signing an outbound Stellar USDC transaction. This bridging rail also works in the other direction.

That’s a relatively simple overview that briefly covers some of this system's many moving and complex parts; below are a few more critical points for the first iterations.

Activation Award POC: Our proof of concept will be a single-validator service with shallow transaction limits and will not be a production release. We will provide public front-ends for testing our solution with small amounts of real assets and a fully open-source codebase, allowing developers to deploy an instance for testing. We will also provide a complete end-to-end demonstration video.

Validators: As mentioned, the POC will have a singular validator. Following a community award, we will extend this to a whitelisted validator set of established authorities within the Stellar ecosystem. At a later stage, the validator process will be fully open, allowing anyone with sufficient assets and technical expertise to run a validator.

Liquidity: Validators will supply the Initial liquidity. A future iteration will enable public liquidity and yield release alongside automatic liquidity balance through arbitrage from an economic pendulum.

Price Movement: Ionize validators will constantly monitor multiple price sources and freeze any relevant pairs where a stable asset diverges from its peg.

Security: We take this very seriously, and Ionize will have low transaction limits and only allow approved partners to provide limited liquidity until we have undergone a security audit.

Speed & Fees: Transaction speed is near-instant but capped to the confirmation times of the chains involved in the pair; Stellar is essentially instant, but finality on Ethereum may take up to 5 minutes. Fees will be minimal, covering any gas necessary plus a minor amount of slippage (~0.2%).

CCTP: When the Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol expands to cover Stellar, we intend to offer all routes via this mechanism while maintaining the existing system for non-usdc routes such as USDT<>USDC.

Existing Bridges: The Ionize bridging module does have some overlap with existing bridges, but as you can see above, our approach is novel and differentiated. Ionize focuses on the utility around those bridges alongside further modular applications that enhance the ecosystem.

Stellar has always prioritized financial interoperability, access, and utility. At Ionize, we’re excited to play our small part in complementing, enabling, and enhancing that value to connect blockchain and the real world further.

- Precision Loss Mitigation: The primary problem solved by SorobanMath is the precision loss inherent in Soroban's 7/9-decimal limit (not a hard limit necessarily) due to the max token balance being limited by the i128 type in Rust. So whenever an output for arithmetic operations is finished, I want to save the result of the arithmetic operations in such a way so that I don't compromise on the precision, even if it means I use more than one i128 type to save the outcome of the arithmetic operations and the rounding of the output is avoided along with a good enough precision.
- Enhanced Development: It simplifies development for developers building on Soroban by providing an ergonomic API for precise mathematical operations.
- Applicability: It benefits developers particularly who develop DeFi Protocols on Soroban requiring high-precision in the mathematical operations.

How It Works and How It Uses Stellar/Soroban:
- SorobanMath extends the precision of fixed-point arithmetic calculations to minimize precision loss.
- The library includes functions for arithmetic operations, logarithms, exponentiation, power, and more.
- It will be a no_std library, something which does not use the Rust standard library, so it is directly usable in any smart contract application in the Soroban ecosystem.

In summary, SorobanMath is a specialized library designed to tackle precision challenges in Soroban, providing developers with advanced mathematical capabilities.",https://rust-soroban.notion.site/rust-soroban/SorobanMath-Library- e46dff7f9e4645f6a22ff556d904cd90,,https://github.com/rahul-soshte/soroban-math,,https://soroban-math.com/no-link,,,,,,,Rahul Soshte,,,twitter.com/RahulSoshte,,

The Problem

Despite the robustness of smart contract auditing, it has not been a panacea for Web3 security breaches. An alarming $2.81 billion in losses were caused by smart contract security compromises, 91.96% of which had been audited. As we stand at the precipice of a new era in Web3 security, we must pivot our approach to anticipate potential breaches and adapt accordingly. Our product, Web3SOC, was specifically designed for this purpose.

The Harsh Reality of Smart Contract Audits in 2022

Long hailed as the gold standard for smart contract security, audits fell notably short in 2022. The stark statistics below show that smart contract auditing struggled to provide the required level of security in the Web3 landscape. Our team at AnChain.AI conducted an in-depth analysis of all major Web3 security incidents in 2022, revealing:

- A staggering $2.81 Billion in losses from smart contract security compromises.
- Smart contract-based incidents made up 70.36% of all Web3 security breaches.
- An alarming 91.96% of the hacked smart contracts had undergone auditing processes, with some audited multiple times by reputable security firms.

Building a secure Web3 DApp in the modern era requires a more systematic approach and a departure from spending most of one’s security budget on smart contract auditing alone. Inspired by Mandiant, FireEye, and other top-tier cybersecurity companies’ best practices, AnChain.AI launched the Web3SOC product at RSA Conference 2023: https://youtu.be/vYQtL130IAk?si=N4gZBG-cOA8j40nN

The Solution

Web3SOC aims to solve the essential problem in the Web3 security industry, by significantly improving MTTD (Mean Time To Detect), MTTR (Mean Time To Respond) key metrics, attack surface threat modeling, and security maturity for all Web3 digital asset businesses.

It focuses on improving the security maturity of Web3 applications:

- Threat Modeling: Model for your DApp’s Attack surface, including smart contracts, private key management, Cloud infra, and all.
- Incident Response Planning: Let’s assume hackers are hacking you right now. What would you do to detect, respond, and remediate?
- Attack simulation and Metrics focused: Start with measuring MTTD: Mean Time to Detect. The Web3SOC fire drill will measure an organization’s key metrics starting with MTTD.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Web3SOC provides real-time monitoring and alerting on potential threats.
- Automatic Response with AI: We leveraged various machine learning and AI algorithms to automate the SOC workflow. “Auto Trace AI” comes in handy for hackers attribution; the machine learning risk scoring engine has scored Billions of Web3 / Blockchain addresses and enabled as real-time API; GPT and LLM will scan smart contracts including vulnerabilities.
- 3rd party integration: Web3SOC connects to mainstream SIEM platforms and other security applications.

Web3SOC framework is built on a proven foundation – the 5-step NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

1. Identify: Understand Web3 digital assets, systems, data, and resources that need protection, and develop a comprehensive understanding of the organization’s cybersecurity risk landscape. For example, smart contract auditing fits into this stage.
2. Protect: Implement safeguards to ensure critical infrastructure services, prevent or minimize damage from cyber threats, and establish security policies and procedures.
3. Detect: Employ monitoring and detection systems to identify cybersecurity events promptly, enabling early detection and effective response.
4. Respond: Develop and implement an incident response plan to address detected cybersecurity events, minimize damage, and ensure a faster return to normal operations.
5. Recover: Restore systems and services affected by a cybersecurity incident by developing a recovery plan, prioritizing critical functions, and incorporating lessons learned to improve overall resilience.

We have reached a critical juncture in the field of Web3 security. The vulnerabilities exposed in smart contract auditing indicate the need for a paradigm shift in our approach. With Web3SOC, we offer a comprehensive solution to safeguard Web3 applications and digital assets. We must prepare for the possibility of a hack happening, rather than reacting to it.

With Soroban introducing smart contracts to the Stellar network, new attack surfaces arise. By integrating Soroban into Web3SOC we aim at helping companies and developers identify these vulnerabilities, monitor, and respond to them.",docs.google.com/document/d/1VgGEejcAobiaJAW_FXJzLWxBbPffR3QnUAS78OFLlxA/edit,,https://web3soc.anchainai.com/,,https://youtu.be/ssOgcER4PdE,,,,,,,"Christian Nunez, Francesco Piccoli",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/anchainai/,https://twitter.com/AnChainAI,,

With Okashi you can rapidly onboard new developers to the ecosystem because we provide an experience just like the one web developers are used to - zero setup, instant feedback, mobile friendly. Our audience includes the millions of web developers that have never tried smart contract development.

The way Okashi works is it simulates the entire Soroban environment and executes contracts right in the browser. We replicate the entire spec from the env.json as JavaScript modules that run completely in the browser. This enables instant feedback and removes the need for a blockchain during contract development.

We allow users to input function arguments using easy to parse formats such as integers and strings, and then perform conversions into Val values. The same happens with Val values being translated to human readable formats when parsing function return values, logs, etc.

Beyond just the learning and development aspect, there is the community building aspect of Okashi that will allow users to learn from their peers.",miro.com/app/board/uXjVNaEjayM=/,,https://okashi.dev/,,https://youtu.be/T0-8Mfo0HHM,,,,,,,Morgan Wilde,,,https://twitter.com/Okashidev,,

Currently, Solang Solidity compiler supports two targets: Solana and Polkadot. This project involves adding Soroban as a third target for compilation. That is, this project is a modification of an already existing product: Solang (a Solidity compiler for Solana and Substrate and hopefully Soroban https://github.com/hyperledger/solang).

The problem it solves, how it solves it and the audience it solves them for:

Solidity is the most famous smart contract language. Its easy learning curve and C-Like syntax makes it an appealing option for developers wanting to try out a new blockchain platform. This project will allow developers to write Soroban contracts in Solidity, therefore making the platform more appealing by simply giving developers more coding options. The target audience would be EVM developers wanting to port their projects to other non-EVM chains. Or, developers who would prefer Solidity to Rust.

How it works:

Currently, Soroban contracts are written in Rust, compiled to WASM by Rustc and then deployed and executed on Soroban. Solang will do the same, but will take Solidity contracts and compile them to WASM.

Departing from the traditional command-line interface, Sorosan offers a user-friendly platform to engage with the Stellar network, aligning with EVM-based smart contract development. Sorosan envisions a future where deploying and interacting with smart contracts becomes as seamless as using an SDK. Initially conceived as a tool for simplifying Soroban work and auditing stellar smart contracts, Sorosan has evolved into an SDK that seamlessly integrates with the Freighter wallet. Sorosan excels in transforming CLI challenges into opportunities, providing a web-based avenue to unlock Stellar's vast potential.

The traditional method of interacting with and deploying contracts using the command-line interface (CLI) can be intimidating and challenging for users with limited technical expertise. Sorosan offers a user-friendly web-based platform that streamlines Soroban interaction, making it accessible to both newcomers to blockchain technology and experienced developers, ultimately enhancing the overall workflow for users.

While developing Sorosan, several complex issues emerged, necessitating research and the development of features to assist with tasks such as obtaining contract information, gas estimation, and contract ID conversion. To facilitate Dapp development, a suite of tools and utilities was created and integrated into the ADK, aimed at simplifying Soroban development. This suite includes contract explorers, token explorers, unit converters, and more, ultimately benefiting developers and users by enhancing productivity and streamlining tasks like contract deployment and interaction.

Sorosan aims to complement Soroban by bringing developers and blockchain enthusiasts to Web3 on Stellar. The Sorosan project offers features for contract deployment, contract information retrieval, and contract interaction on Soroban. It also enables token interaction, allowing users to create or interact with Wrapped Assets on Stellar.

Allbridge Core,SCF #20,Allbridge Core,Allbridge Core,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recbUS7phMUCfxP6V,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$50000.00,$50000.00,400576.80,11/7/2023,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,Allbridge Core enables users to seamlessly access the Stellar ecosystem through native stablecoin swaps.,"Allbridge is an accomplished cross-chain solution provider specializing in integrations of EVM with non-EVM chains. In 2022, we participated in the Bridge Bounty Program, successfully deploying Stellar integration on Allbridge Classic and connecting the Stellar ecosystem with Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and BNB Chain.

The most unique aspect of the integration revolved around the absence of smart contracts on Stellar. This is why an intermediary smart contract was implemented to handle the signature validation. Throughout the integration process, we have expanded our knowledge of the Stellar blockchain and grown accustomed to building Stellar-based applications.

Fall 2022 marked the launch of our new bridging solution, Allbridge Core, which caters specifically to native stablecoin swaps. To enable native transfers, a liquidity pool is deployed per every supported asset. After initiating the transaction, incoming tokens enter the pool, and their value is sent via the messaging protocol to a destination chain. On arrival, this value is converted back to native stablecoins, which are then credited to the user.

Core’s user-friendly features ease the onboarding for new users by enabling them to attach additional gas on destination. This way, users can participate in the ecosystem dApps as soon as they bridge their funds without resorting to centralized entities to acquire gas.

However, in the case of Core, the bridge architecture relies on the availability of smart contracts, which was the main limitation of integrating Stellar in the past. The introduction of Soroban became a major breakthrough and a final missing piece for bringing the Allbridge Core experience to Stellar.

Deploying our stablecoin solution on Stellar will allow users from different chains to tap into the $110 million USDC market and create some unique bridging routes from Solana, Arbitrum, and Tron ecosystems.

Another major component of Allbridge Core is the availability of the SDK that provides a seamless integration process. By plugging our solution under the hood, Stellar dApps can benefit from extra liquidity transfers from different chains, which shapes Allbridge Core as a building block for the entire ecosystem.

The development will span across multiple milestones. As part of the Activation Award, we will finalize the architecture and implement the smart contracts, creating a foundation for the prototype. The Community Award resubmission would entail the implementation of the web UI and prototype’s deployment on the testnet.

After the prototype is deployed, we are looking to deliver additional functionality to the end product. We will participate in the next SCF rounds to support the ongoing development and bridge maintenance.

The next major milestone following the prototype’s deployment is the security audit and the implementation of follow-up fixes to address the findings. When the audit is complete, the bridge will be deployed on production, launching the USDC pool, supplied with the initial liquidity.

Another major feature we are looking to bring is the slippage-free USDC swaps through Circle’s CCTP. At the moment, we are developing a CCTP swap option for USDC-to-USDC swaps, and when it is available on Stellar, we are looking to implement its functionality in Allbridge Core.

The CCTP implementation will undergo a second round of security reviews, and once the fixes are complete, it will be deployed on production, allowing users to take advantage of seamless USDC swaps.",drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1jN4fy5Y_NbzPkPn0Q61ofbDqEKVhOxWa/view,,https://core.allbridge.io/,https://github.com/allbridge-io,https://youtu.be/OC5s990JhL8,,,,,,,"Pavlo Velykyi, Andriy Velykyi",,,,,

We describe this initial deployment as Phoenix DEX ""Phase 1"". Having studied several DEXs, we have identified the unique needs of both liquidity providers and traders. The needs of both traders and liquidity providers are our North Star in how we approach product design. Traders desire low fees, low slippage, fast order execution, and a variety of trending and ""blue chip"" assets, while liquidity providers want sustainable yields, reduction in impermanent loss, low “hold up” of liquidity, and certainty quality of life features such as auto-compounding. Our DEX and our future suite of products will leverage Soroban’s 5-second finality and 150 TPS to provide DeFi users with a seamless and high-speed experience.

Our AMM's architecture is modular and robust, featuring a series of interconnected smart contracts - Pool, StablePool, Staking, Multihop (routing), and Factory - each serving specialized functions. From facilitating basic swaps in the Pool contract to complex routing of trades, we've created an efficient and flexible structure. This modular design allows for quick adaptations to market trends and easy incorporation of future upgrades. Particularly, the Staking contract will uniquely support a reward-boosting mechanism, where loyalty in providing liquidity is incentivized with up to a 30% reward increase over 60 days. The Factory Contract not only allows us to deploy new pools but also provides the flexibility to deregister them, ensuring an agile response to market dynamics.

It uses an off-chain order book to provide a platform with a risk engine, matching engine, shared asset pools, and settlement on-chain. Using automated orders opens infinite trading possibilities. The issue we address: DEX trading often comes with high gas costs, fees, and slippage. Professional traders seldom use DeFi due to its lack of speed and liquidity. Derivative DEXs lack white-label solutions. Trading options are limited in their flexibility.

Smart Contract: The primary Smart Contract, the asset manager, facilitates account creation, permits the depositing and withdrawal of approved assets, and updates user balances on-chain following trade completions.

Off-Chain Engine: The Orderbook's Matching Engine operates off-chain, utilizing a smart settlement contract. It offers order handling and trade matching and manages the upload of executed trades back to the smart contract.

Automated orders: Automated orders, built on smart contract technology, are self-executing trades that enhance market efficiency and security. Each order autonomously acts on protocol triggers, ensuring safe transaction execution.

AUTOMATED ORDERS: Resilience, Fairness, and Soundness. Automated orders are designed using formal methods. In this case, these methods can be used to ensure that the orders are resilient (able to withstand shocks and stresses), fair (equitable to all participants), and sound (operating as intended without errors or vulnerabilities).

Self-Auditing Trading Code: By defining the domain of all possible interactions and actions, the code that governs these automated orders can be designed to audit itself. This means it can monitor its operations to detect and correct errors or vulnerabilities, enhancing its reliability and trustworthiness. The automated order is an advanced feature that will implement interfaces allowing users to easily specify desired automated orders without the need to understand deep bots programming.

A simple market order (swap) interface for selecting the trading pair and specifying the exchanged amount; a simple limit order interface for specifying the price bounds and the amounts of tokens to transact; a simple interface for scripting (JS) specifying: The interval, frequency, and parameters: Trading Strategy: Define parameters (e.g., moving average periods, thresholds for order placements, etc.) The logic for placing orders on the spot (e.g., buy low/sell high) The logic for entering/exiting perpetual swap positions based on leverage and risk management Execution: Place new orders or cancel old ones based on strategy Ensure risk management (e.g., avoid placing orders if balance/margin is low) JS Example: https://hackmd.io/@yGq0F7vpRemivOCoIltt0A/B1FfErS2h

2) Establish an anchor (known as ""Anchor"" in English within Stellar) for trading between RWA assets and USDC, [https://zet.whalefin.com/.well-known/stellar.toml](https://zet.whalefin.com/.well-known/stellar.toml). (The domain zet.whalefin.com can be replaced with the official domain of our project when the time comes. If it's under whalefin, this domain can be used.)
3) As an anchor, we will follow SEP-24 (Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal), SEP-10 (Stellar Authentication), and SEP-12 (KYC API) to achieve interoperability between on-chain tokens and treasury bills.
4) The anchor (us) will collaborate with influential oracle providers in the industry to use oracles to obtain and update the on-chain asset prices of treasury bills, calculating the asset value based on user shares.
5) When users exchange USDC and RWA assets through the anchor, relevant information about the asset's source and oracle quotations will be written together into the transaction's Memo.

Integration with Stellar
1) We will run at least two Horizon instances to ensure redundancy and scalability. Additionally, we will use [https://horizon.stellar.org](https://horizon.stellar.org) as a backup.
2) We will support the Stellar chain within our enterprise-grade cryptographic asset hardware wallet (HSM) to ensure the security of all our operations and assets.
3) Within the HSM, we will facilitate functionalities such as the creation of Stellar accounts and the ability to send and receive payments.

CTX.com CTX is a crypto payments processor, we have processed over $800k in payments and offer a web point-of-sale, merchant API, rates engine, hardware devices, nfc payment cards and more. This project will build on our experience, tech and infrastructure to create a new service for users to spend USDC & XLM across the US with plans to expand internationally following release.

Gift Card System The main part of this project is a comprehensive gift card procurement and delivery system. It will enable anyone to shop with Stellar in over 100,000 locations across the US as well as online at 100+ major retailers. For the in-store version, a user will be able to visit and make an order at their local Subway, Walgreens, Olive garden, GameStop and many other participating merchants. Once they are ready to pay they enter their total into the app, pay using XLM or USDC and receive a gift card for their exact amount with a barcode to display to the merchant to complete their purchase. Alongside the in-store solution will be one for online stores, allowing users to purchase gift cards from large online merchants. Additionally users will receive cashback in the form of a USDC credit to their account that they can withdraw or use towards a future purchase. This is an ambitious and high-value project with multiple moving parts including gift card procurement, user authentication, payment processing and cash flow handling for settlement, provided by user-friendly apps for all major platforms. We are an efficient agile team and through leveraging our existing systems we will be able to deliver a v1.0 at end of this cycle.

Adding Stellar support to the existing CTX.com payment processing stack We'll be adding multiple load balanced core nodes or horizon + captive core instances to our infrastructure to enable real-time transaction processing as well as extending our back-end systems accordingly. We'll also be updating our front-ends and related platform infrastructure to enable merchants to accept XLM & USDC.

Adding USDC & XLM to our rates engine To provide the conversion rates for 168 local currencies we source data from 14 different providers like Binance & Kraken. We can then calculate any route, even through numerous hops (e.g. XLM>USD>HKD) to create a composite after removing outliers to provide accurate current rates. You can view this API here: http://rates.ctx.com/ This API has served hundreds of millions of queries since 2019 with 99.99% up-time. This service is open to public use albeit rate limited and without guarantee.

Stellar-MetaMask,SCF #19,Stellar On Metamask,Stellar-MetaMask,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/reccBR6CyNvbjqL2E,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$71000.00,$71000.00,674028.95,10/11/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,"We Will put Stellar on Metamask, to grow stellar ecosystem. Through the use of a metamask snap.","We will build a complete Stellar-Lumens wallet that seamlessly integrates into Metamask Browser Extension. This means that all 30 Million MetaMask users can be easily onboarded into the stellar-lumens/soroban ecosystem. We believe this will lead to explosive growth of the web3 leg of the Stellar ecosystem, due to the sheer popularity of the Metamask Extension and familiar developer experience. This allows new Dapps to see Stellar-Lumens as a more viable platform to build with, and allows existing Dapps to reach lots of new users.

A snap is like a MetaMask plug-in. It’s a piece of code that runs inside the metamask extension itself. Importantly, snaps do not require a lengthy installation process like most plugins, and are simply installed automatically, after being requested by a website, and a user gives consent. Once installed, the wallet will never have to be reinstalled, and all keys and accounts are recoverable through the same process as recovering the metamask wallet as a whole.

In order to create a better developer experience, we will also provide a wallet SDK. This will allow developers to integrate MetaMask into their stellar Dapp with as little headache as possible. Meaning that existing Soroban and stellar apps can start accommodating metamask users sooner.

When a user goes to a Stellar Dapp, they will have the option to connect with metamask. If they choose this option, MetaMask will automatically install stellar into their wallet, and from there the dapp will be able to interact with MetaMask just like any other stellar wallet. Importantly, this means new users won't have to download and install a Stellar wallet to use a Dapp, as long as they have MetaMask. Metamask also provides these users with a familiar interface which cuts down on confusion, and ultimately leads to greater adoption of stellar in web3.

Web3 Developers often have a difficult time choosing a platform when developing a new Dapp. By putting Stellar Lumens on MetaMask, developers don’t have to worry about a given user losing interest while getting a stellar wallet set up. On top of this, many developers are already familiar with developing for metamask, which cuts down on the learning curve when onboarding new developers into the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem.

Keys are generated on the fly using entropy requested from the MetaMask wallet. This results in users having complete control over their keys (a non-custodial wallet). And because this entropy is programmatically derived from a user's private Ethereum keys, recovering a MetaMask wallet will also recover the user's Stellar wallet.

We take security very seriously, and all code running inside a user's MetaMask will be code audited and executed in a restricted Secure JavaScript Execution Environment. All storage in the wallet is encrypted, and unsigned transactions are never sent over the wire.",,,https://stellardemo.netlify.app/,https://github.com/paulfears/StellarSnap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VenhahQ5zo,,,,,,,Paul Fears,,,,https://discord.gg/R2wd9ZJ89X,
Syklo,SCF #19,Syklo WooCommerce integration,Syklo,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recnQwmWOJN7EZPmj,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$25100.00,$25100.00,221407.83,10/5/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,We are building the bridges and roads for mass adoption of self-custodial USDC in LATAM. ,"By installing the Syklo Pay WooCommerce plugin, businesses would allow their customers to pay with any off-chain local currency (ARS, BRL, COP, VES, etc…) and receive USDC on Stellar. 

Monetary protocols from many countries (e.g. Argentina and Venezuela) are not working. These countries are organically transitioning to blockchain-based dollars. Currently, USDT on Tron is very popular. USDC on Polygon would be better. However, USDC on Stellar would be the best solution, especially for businesses that receive small payments and need USD convertibility to pay providers. 

Online businesses would benefit from being able to charge local currency anywhere, receive instead USDC on Stellar at low fees, and later use it to pay providers. 43% of sites use WordPress, some 35 million sites. WooCommerce’s market share in ecommerce platforms is 25% and over 3.5 million websites use WooCommerce checkout. Syklo Pay would help them be internationally available. The difference with other crypto plugins is that with Syklo, the business’ customers can obtain USDC via P2P with many local currencies and payment methods. 

Users would need to install the Syklo Payment Gateway for WooCommerce, signup/signin their Syklo account, and click on Syklo Pay in WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Syklo → Manage. In Syklo, create an API Key and copy it. In WooCommerce, paste the API key. In WooCommerce, copy the endpoint URL. In Syklo, click add an endpoint, paste the endpoint URL. In Syklo, click show shared secret and copy the shared secret. In WooCommerce, paste the shared secret. Business’ customers would then be able to pay with Stellar USDC. 

Once the plugin is configured and users click on pay with Syklo, they will be redirected to pay.syklo.io and shown a QR code with the business’ USDC address. The customer would then open the Syklo mobile app, with a few clicks purchase Stellar USDC with their local currency and send to the payment QR. The site will detect when the payment is sent and will return to the business checkout so the order is processed. 

The business will be able to see WooCommerce transactions and details in a dashboard and refund them if needed. Users hold assets on individual Stellar wallets that would be able to pay in WooCommerce websites, send assets to other users, exchange off-chain assets with the help of a temporary on-chain multisig escrow, create escrow (create multisig wallet, setup signers [buyer, seller, jury], establish trustline for USDC, transfer funds from seller to the escrow), release escrow (collect the required signatures to release the funds, submit the transaction to the network), and mediation (if there is a disagreement during the transaction flow, users can raise a dispute regarding the transaction where a jury (currently a Syklo support member) will review the case and sign the transaction in favor of a winner). 

All transactions are currently sponsored by Syklo. The transactions use channels to ensure reliability and prevent sequence number collisions. Also, transactions use sponsorship future reserves to allow users to submit transactions to the network without needing a minimum XLM reserve. Multisig wallets are ephemeral; once the escrow is released, the escrow account is merged into the creator account. We currently use the Stellar blockchain in our Android app due to its efficient design and reliability.

Royalties play a pivotal role in digital economies. The industry has encountered numerous obstacles in achieving decentralized payment enforcements (as we discussed in Meridian 2022, see video excerpt here). Presently, most marketplaces retain significant control over enforcing royalty payments (see this Tweet from OpenSea), which poses challenges to creators and businesses. Royalty smart contracts adopting a restrictive approach by controlling trade execution can also have adverse effects, significantly narrowing the sales funnel for creators. While Litemint is working on incorporating support for such contracts, we recognize that it is just one aspect of the solution. These contracts are decentralized in principle, however they might not offer the openness required for general use cases. To address these challenges, we have identified a unique combination of Soroban smart contracts, a dedicated Oracle, and Stellar classic primitives (pre-auth transactions). These present an exceptional opportunity to implement the first comprehensive solution for decentralized NFT royalty payment enforcements. In this implementation, smart contracts are not used to control trade execution flow but rather to offer creators the assurance that they can revoke ownership if specific conditions are met (such as missed royalty payments). Concurrently, current owners are guaranteed that their ownership remains irrevocable as long as those conditions are not met. We are also working on making these features as accessible as possible to creators (including mobile and desktop), please check our video or the screenshots attached.

Advanced Auctions

We have been providing decentralized, no escrow, time-limited auctions, with full SDEX execution (aka Live Auctions) on our platform since September 2021. Check this blog for technical details. These live auctions account for 35% of NFT sales on Litemint. Yet there are unavoidable limits (e.g. preventing auction sniping or implementing advanced models like second price auctions…). With the advent of Soroban smart contracts, we have the opportunity to extend our auction system for publishers. Besides our in-house solution which should cover common use cases, we will be incorporating support for third-party contracts, like for royalties.

Real-time and Historical Price Indexer

One of the most expected features on Litemint is the ability to track, filter and search assets by interest (bids/offers across all markets), collections, creators and provide some essential charting tools. We currently run a price indexer to provide cross-market history for sales, however it is currently not fit for real-time data queries (several hours latency over blockchain activity). As part of V2, our existing search engine has undergone refactoring using Azure Search. We intend to utilize this infrastructure to support the historical price indexer. This work is also a needed component for our Oracle-based solution for royalties.",,,https://litemint.com,https://github.com/litemint,https://youtu.be/8mFbqhuDKrc,,,,,,,Frederic James Bernard Rezeau,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/litemint,https://twitter.com/LitemintHQ,https://litemint.gg,

This extension is geared towards bolstering its efficiency, practicality, and comprehensiveness. Users will be able to access the ledger history with improved speed and convenience, extending the overall user experience. The search functionality is set to be advanced, allowing for precise data retrieval based on diverse parameters. Keeping up with our commitment to real-time information delivery, we will further refine the system's ability to provide live updates of the Stellar network activities. An amplified focus on the transaction details will provide a holistic view of each transaction, enhancing understanding and transparency. Enhancements are also planned to ease the transition between Stellar's Testnet and Mainnet, promoting a fluid, user-friendly exploration experience across different environments. As part of our efforts to provide comprehensive historical insights, we will ensure substantial historical data retention, allowing efficient tracking of the ledger's evolution over time. Lastly, we will amplify the platform's visualisation and analytical tools, promoting an intuitive understanding of complex ledger data. Overall, this new phase will enhance user interaction with blockchain data, promising a seamless and enriched experience while maintaining the familiarity of the existing system.

Unlock would achieve this with public-good smart contracts that provide the indexing functionality with meaningful utility in its own right, and as a component of more advanced DeFi products. The index protocol would enable a user to define two or more underlying assets, such as XLM and USDC, assign them a share of the overall “index” being tokenized, and create the resulting index token. Critically, Unlock’s approach would allow for the newly created tokenized asset to capture the proportional yield of underlying assets, unlocking diversification and yield-generating strategies, as well as enabling the move of Real World Assets on-chain.

Problem: While exposure to crypto, NFTs, and other on-chain assets provide opportunities to invest in the future of the internet, these assets lack many of the aspects of traditional financial instruments that enhance outcomes for market participants. Specifically, Web3 assets are inherently volatile and subject to meaningful price fluctuations and do not feature a straightforward way to diversify idiosyncratic risk. With traditional financial assets, intermediaries or “trusted” third parties provide indexed solutions that are responsible for purchasing the underlying assets and constructing the index to diversify risk. An indexed solution is particularly attractive for on-chain assets not only due to the diversification it can provide, but critically that it performs the indexing via smart contract, in a trustless manner.

How it works: Unlock will build upon and extend the Stellar Asset Contract (SAC), adding the concept of an index fund token that holds other tokens as underlying components. Index fund tokens (IFTs) have the property that they can only be minted by transferring each of the underlying assets in specific amounts to the IFT contract. The IFT contract also guarantees that fund tokens can always be redeemed (burned) in exchange for each of its components. This way, IFT holders can rely on the fund token’s net asset value (NAV = holdings of underlying components * price) being realizable. The Stellar Asset Contract can also be used to wrap native assets issued on the Stellar blockchain. This means the entire universe of transferable assets on Stellar today is ready to be used as components inside of fund tokens. Classic assets on Stellar come with powerful features that help both issuers and holders of assets have control over which counterparties they trust. IFTs can be configured to inherit the authorizations attached to components. For example, an IFT could respect the KYC/AML policies of each asset it holds. The attached diagram (Figure 1) shows how Unlock’s Token Factory smart contracts let users deploy a new index fund token by specifying an arbitrary-length array of SAC-wrapped classic assets and Soroban tokens as components.",,,no-link.com/yet,,https://youtu.be/XbZKhkN_bIk,,,,,,,"Edward Kim, Ignacio Garcia Leon",,,,,

Problem: Accessing blockchain data is complex and time-consuming, requiring builders to run a node, write complex code, and/or set up data engineering pipelines. This process diverts valuable time from app dev.

Solution: Goldsky Mirror is a real-time data replication system that allows builders to pipe decoded blockchain data to where their app is: where to take data from, how to process it, and where to persist results.

Benefits: Compared to other approaches to indexing blockchain data, Goldsky Mirror offers a few specific and differentiated benefits:

Self-hosted: Results are persisted in a database / as flat files rather than being served only via a remote API. This allows for seamless integration with other app/user data, simplifying builders' data stack.

Self-healing: Quality checks, fixes, and improvements to data are applied automatically w/ upserts & deletes, allowing builders to focus on using the database vs. maintaining it.

Scalable: Builders can index data from multiple sources (and push to multiple sinks) with infinite horizontal scaling. This allows for complete historical backfills in record speed and seamless multi-chain apps.

Simple: Mirror pipelines can be set up through a 5-step interactive CLI, or in JSON for more flexibility. This ease of use makes building with Mirror incredibly easy yet scalable from hackathons to production use cases with millions of users.

indexed.xyz (open public dataset)

Problem: Web3 analytics often require a costly cloud datastore, limiting large-scale web3 data accessibility to pro users and institutions.

Solution: indexed.xyz is a public, open, and CC0-licensed blockchain dataset that allows anyone to freely download, copy, and use the data without any restrictions.

Benefits: For analytics use cases where chain-level data aggregation and transformation is useful, existing solutions can be limiting and indexed.xyz offers several differentiated benefits:

Open and unrestricted access: Unlike many cloud-based data solutions that impose limitations and charge for access, indexed.xyz is completely unrestricted - not even requiring an account. This allows developers, analysts, and app-builders to freely download, copy, and use the data with greater control and flexibility.

User-friendly data format: indexed.xyz uses the widely adopted .parquet format, which is natively compressed, queryable, and compatible with popular data tooling and platforms. This user-friendly format streamlines the data analysis process and makes it easier for developers to work with the data and increase developer velocity.

Local-first: Our local-first approach enables users to leverage their existing storage and compute resources, bypassing the need for a sustained internet connection and the costs associated with cloud-based storage and compute (eg. BigQuery compute fees). This allows users to work with data more efficiently and at a lower cost, especially for macro analysis.",,,https://goldsky.com,https://github.com/indexed-xyz/docs,https://share.goldsky.com/v/myW4bJPY1xdhZBMxRAUqKDB7h,,,,,,,Hemanth Soni,,,https://twitter.com/goldskyio,,

The core functionality of the smart contract would allow any assets (tokens) that exist on Stellar to be split in a trustless, automated, & transparent way across addresses and the user interface would enable all Stellar community members & projects to leverage the technology as a public good. This functionality is a fundamental component to move the ecosystem away from off-chain counterparties and “trusted” middlemen to a truly decentralized contracting & payment structure, a critical building block for the continued growth of the Stellar ecosystem.

Problem: A fundamental aspect of Web3 is the ability for users to collaborate in a joint venture in a decentralized manner. While this has enabled incredible technology to be built, the resulting creation & capture of value is often not directly aligned with those users. This allocation problem is inherent in many decentralized endeavors. While this problem manifests itself throughout Web3, specific examples that exist today include: DAOs. Rewarding members & contributors their share of treasury rewards and/or earned revenue with a single payment, rather than constantly managing a list of addresses, reducing the administrative burden to manage payments. Web3 platforms. Lacking a trusted solution to distribute payment, on-chain, to groups of users who provide services. Creatives. Distributing share of the economics, in a transparent way that is verifiable prior to execution, to backers of projects & fans. NFT projects. Providing a mechanism to distribute a portion of royalty fees to holders, in a trustless manner.

How it works: Initialization - The contract is set up with a list of recipients and their respective percentage shares. These recipients will receive native tokens based on these shares. An administrator is assigned who can manage the contract. Updating Shares - If the contract is marked as ""mutable,"" the administrator can update the list of recipients and their shares. Shares represent how much of the total tokens recipients receive. The administrator can adjust the percentages assigned to each recipient, as long as the total percentages remain 100%. Locking the Contract - The administrator has the option to lock the contract, preventing any further changes to the recipient shares and other settings. Once locked, the contract becomes immutable. Distributing Native Tokens - The administrator initiates the distribution of native tokens to recipients based on their assigned percentage shares. The contract calculates the amount of tokens each recipient should receive and distributes them accordingly. Querying the Contract - Users can query the contract to retrieve information about its configuration, individual shares, and recipients. This helps anyone interested in verifying the contract's state & distribution of tokens.",,,nolink.com/yet,,https://youtu.be/iWLnxQSmRJU,,,,,,,"Arda Nakisci, Ignacio Garcia Leon, Michal Fiuk",,,,,

Introduction As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its widespread adoption is impeded by its complexity and user-unfriendliness. The difficulties many users face, such as the risk of fund loss and the technical challenges of managing wallets and public-private key pairs, inhibit the full potential of blockchain applications. This issue is even more pertinent for DAOs and other organizational groups, which require advanced and reliable workflows beyond just simple signing. Having a multisig wallet is crucial for a thriving ecosystem as it enables projects and business models such as custody solution, key retrieval, DAOs amongst others.

Our Solution: MultiClique Our proposed solution is the development of MultiClique, a protocol designed for the Soroban/Stellar network. MultiClique enhances security through a multi-signature mechanism, which significantly mitigates the risk of fund theft if a single private key is compromised. Moreover, it provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Soroban and managing digital assets in a more intuitive way, offering users both convenience and peace of mind. Beyond security and convenience, MultiClique also introduces flexibility by allowing for customizable policies prior to executing transactions.

How We Use Soroban Our team, consisting of former members of DSTOQ who previously tokenized stocks on the Stellar network, greatly appreciates the visionary aspect of account abstraction as implemented in the native Stellar protocol. This concept allowed for advanced schemes such as Key Recovery and Sponsored Payments long before ERC-4337 was drafted. As pioneers in implementing an FMA (Financial Market Authorities) approved Key Recovery Scheme and sponsored payments in our DSTOQ protocol, we now aim to bring advanced account abstraction to Soroban with a clean user interface through MultiClique. MultiClique is a CustomAccount Protocol that employs Soroban’s built-in __check_auth mechanism to create a policy system for managing members and signing thresholds for asset transfer and contract calls. The core policy can be extended by hook points that are integrated into the policy flow, making the policy system flexible and extendable. It's not just a protocol, but a complete application stack with a user interface that simplifies the usage of multi-signature policies and council-managed contract calls, providing an easy-to-use, no-code experience.",,,https://deep-ink.ventures,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/12kZQFtAY986TRfk1Xc2UGpsS3uY1jPtt/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,Christian Peters,,,https://twitter.com/Multiclique_org,https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1159218967890624584,

Both newcomers and experienced members of the Stellar community will be able to focus on their main tasks - CanFY will take care of the rest for them.

Documents and Code AI Assistant: This tool will assist new Soroban users during onboarding and provide guidance for more experienced users through development documentation, including code generation and issue resolution. Canfy is a modular system encompassing a unique data processing and search engine. This system maximizes the efficiency of modern OSS LLMs (large language models) and OpenAI GPT models. In the initial phase, we'll create and fine-tune an independent instance of Canfy specifically for the Soroban community. This instance will host and routinely update all current documentation, example code, and all public issues and discussions related to Soroban.

Discord Canfy Integration for the Soroban Community: This will be a boon for the entire community. The Canfy system will utilize public Discord chat data to assist in resolving complex cases and answering even more specialized questions. We'll develop a Discord bot that syncs data from Discord to the Canfy instance database. This bot will also serve as an additional interface to address questions and assist with issues.

Custom Encoder and OSS LLM for the Soroban Community: This is the project's primary deliverable. It promises an unparalleled understanding of Soroban data, significantly enhancing the accuracy of answers and solutions provided by the system. The community can also use it for private and sensitive data in internal projects. With a custom OSS LLM, Canfy becomes a wholly independent, self-hosted system that ensures data remains within its components and is not transmitted elsewhere. To achieve this, we'll use data from the first two steps and generate additional dialogs with the help of our LLMs, which are trained specifically for this purpose. Armed with this new dataset, we'll be able to fine-tune our encoder and LLM to concentrate on the Soroban-specific data domain.",,,https://app.canfy.net/magic/2876528478d9c8f533a6793446a2265b,,https://youtu.be/6GskqdR8qJI,,,,,,,Maxim Kushner,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/canfy/,,,

To enable this reality, our team will build the underlying functionality to compile source code and the interface that allows users to interface with the explorer. This smart contract explorer will provide the community with a user-centric experience, requiring minimal expertise or highly technical input from Stellar users while verifying a streamlined process to verify & publish contract smart code. The core verification operation would involve utilizing hosted Docker containers to generate a hash of the underlying byte code and comparing the hash with the underlying contract code - verifying the smart contract based on user input parameters, all presented in a webform user interface and providing a simple “green check” for validation to the community. The compiler will initially provide support across a targeted set of parameters (i.e. only code written in Rust, only using the most current Soroban compiler version, etc.), focusing on the primary anticipated use cases, allowing us to deliver value to the community as quickly as possible and glean valuable user feedback that will inform plans for expanded support and additional features over time. We envision supporting an increased set of parameters (additional languages, etc.) over time, driven by where the community demand is most acute. Our team’s core product can also reside within the StellarExpert platform, enhancing a de facto existing community standard for exploring on-chain activity across Stellar and providing value to users while not asking them to deviate from their existing habits & patterns of use. We have been in contact with the StellarExpert team and look forward to plugging our Smart Contract Explorer functionality into their existing platform, enhancing value for users and trust across the Stellar ecosystem.

Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.

Product Roadmap:

Version 1: Basic lending and borrowing function: A decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) fashion.

Margin positions: Effectively portfolio + global margining margin account: user can deposit to a subaccount owned by the contract but belongs to the user. The user can create positions and orders from the subaccount that’s immediately counted as collateral.

Flash loans.

Stable coins markets: The Stablecoins markets feature maximizes capital efficiency when collateral and borrowed assets have correlated prices. For example, DAI, USDC, USDT are all stablecoins pegged to USD. These stablecoins are all within the same category. Accordingly, a user supplying DAI in this category will have higher collateralization power when borrowing assets like USDC or USDT.

Collateral switch: The Collateral switch feature allows the user to switch supplied liquidity in one asset type to another asset type without a separate withdrawal and supply transaction (for example switching USDC to DAI in a single transaction).

Version 2: V2 Permissionless lending/collateral assets. Achieved by having an ecosystem of locked bids for a fixed time period. User also effectively have debt limits. User should utilize deposited stables to bid so that locked bids can earn yield.

Governance Isolation Mode: Isolation mode allows Governance to list new assets as isolated assets, which have a specific debt ceiling. Only certain assets can be borrowed in isolation mode – specifically, approved stablecoins. In order for an asset to become approved for borrowing, assets are voted on by Governance through the forum. Each isolated asset will have a specific debt ceiling, which means that it is only possible to borrow up to the specified debt ceiling amount. The debt ceiling is visible on the reserves page of each asset.",,,https://www.figma.com/file/zm6ZfMduXumhL2hZFUq3qO/AssetsDesk,https://github.com/AssetDesk,https://www.figma.com/file/zm6ZfMduXumhL2hZFUq3qO/AssetsDesk,,,,,,,Mike Yezhov,,,https://twitter.com/AssetDesk,,

We are currently running a closed beta with a few users and iterating their feedback on the basic flow of the application, making sure that all these key processes work as we envision them. As this process goes by, we look to onboard new customers and start testing our market and user assumptions on a larger scale.

The main product we are now testing, and that will soon launch publicly, is a money transfer service. Senders indicate a payment method, the recipient from their contact list, and the amount they want to send. We take care of everything in the back end from tying their wallet to their bank account through Plaid, KYC, on-ramping USDC, and delivering them directly in the recipient wallet. On the receiving end, we create a custodial wallet for our users where they see reflected the amount of USDC received. At that point, they have two options: they can save the money in USDC or withdraw the total or partial amount to a local bank account.

In the near future, we want to expand the options for users mainly on the receiving side, granting ease in how they can spend their USDC. One option would be offering a Visa Debit card to spend the USDC directly. This will be crucial as we give them an immediate ease in spending their available balance. This feature has proven to be a main driver of user acquisition in the region. Additionally, by integrating with Moneygram, we can also foster access to a stablecoin-to-cash (and vice versa) feature, giving them absolute control and tangibility over their funds. With these three total options - saving or withdrawing to a bank account; debit cards; cash-to-stablecoin access - USDC will be extremely tangible for Latin Americans.

As we are on a quest to turn stablecoin adoption into the mainstream, we want to do so with as many local partners as we can. Moneygram is just the start, but think of enabling Stellar on- and off-ramp services in small shops and other places that make up part of users’ daily activities. This is how we envision our second main feature, the voucher system, to work and we have had - without even a concrete product to show yet on this end - extremely encouraging traction with local business chains.",,,https://kometpay.com/,,https://youtu.be/005_BL9j1OY,,,,,,,"Paolo Astone, Nicolas Zuleta Plinedo",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kometpay/?viewAsMember=true,,kometpay,

It will utilize Stellar and Soroban to deliver swift, secure, and cost-effective transactions no matter where and with no matter whom a traveler may find themselves transacting. Conventional peer-to-peer providers such as Venmo excel in user experience, yet their functionality remains confined to their home country. Alternative solutions like PayPal, Wise, and Revolut enable international payments but can be cumbersome to use, overly expensive for simple transfers, or limited in their geographic accessibility. Blaze aspires to create an experience that merges the effortless and social user experience of Venmo with truly borderless accessibility made possible by the Stellar network's unique anchor ecosystem. While it's powered by crypto, Blaze is carefully designed to hide all the associated complexities from the everyday user. By doing so, and by obsessively focusing our user experience towards the nomad and expat lifestyles, we hope to significantly widen the utilization and reach of the Stellar network.

Simultaneously Non-Custodial, User-Friendly, and Highly Recoverable Blaze offers a payments experience centered around non-custodial wallets on Stellar without all the usual pitfalls. We will use Web3Auth to allow users to sign up and log in using SMS, Email, and pin code. In the future, we may augment our Web3Auth system with a parallel SEP-30 implementation for added security and mitigation of counterparty risk.

People-centric Payments One key feature of Venmo's success in North America is that it made the routine act of paying people into a social experience. Blaze will do the same for cross-border payments. We will feature a privacy-conscious social feed, a native friend graph as well as an integration with Instagram. Users will be able to pay each other using everyday identifiers like phone number or Instagram handle.

User-friendly Anchor Integrations Blaze will initially focus on user-friendly SEP6/SEP12 integrations of anchors in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and Europe. In North America, Blaze is working with a key strategic infrastructure partner to implement a custom ramp.

Send and Receive for Free in Dollars. Think in Pesos. All in-app payments will happen in USDC, which reduces transaction costs, keeps the experience lightweight, and allows customers with volatile native currencies to benefit from holding dollars. We will use fee bumps and sponsored accounts to fully sponsor all in-app payments, keeping them free for users.

(Soroban) Give Back to the Communities You Visit Inspired by previous SCF grant winner ""CashAbroad"", Blaze will implement a smart contract that can add a donation on top of any other peer-to-peer payment on the network. The smart contract will maintain a verified directory of beneficiaries, as well as facilitate the actual payment-plus-donation transactions. The contract will be designed in such a way that any Soroban-connected project can make use of it, not just Blaze. For further details, please see the Additional Information section.

(Soroban) Account Specific Token Allowances Certain advanced features require moving funds on behalf of a user. We aim to do this without compromising user self-custody. Allowances on the native Stellar Asset Contract enable this but also expose a security threat. Through the allowances account, a hacker can steal large amounts of funds in one go. We will create a custom account contract that allows for recipient-scoped permissions. The allowances account will have permission to move funds only to specified recipients. That way a hacker would need to compromise both the allowance account and specified recipient accounts to steal money. Many projects in the Soroban ecosystem will be able to benefit from this increase in security.

By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts, it securely stores, issues, and verifies credentials, ensuring their non-transferability and immutability, as well as eliminating the risk of tampering. In its initial development phase, Chaincerts was conceptualized to use Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on the Stellar network. The tokens were intended to serve as identity tokens, showcasing an individual's characteristics, features, traits, and achievements. With the development of W3C specifications for managing decentralized identities, along with the demand for more robust identity solutions, our team realized the limitations of SBTs and embarked on a journey of transformation and innovation. This strategic transformation led Chaincerts to evolve into an advanced Self-Sovereign Identity application. By seamlessly aligning with the W3C's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) standards, users gain full control, portability, and interoperability over their identity data, boosting security and privacy. This shift also prioritizes smooth integration with systems that adhere to the same specifications. Despite undergoing a fundamental transition, the problem Chaincerts set out to solve remains the same — to provide a modern solution to the outdated and unreliable certification system. Chaincerts operates as a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) application, leveraging Stellar’s blockchain infrastructure and Soroban smart contracts to securely manage digital identities and credentials. By introducing a decentralized identity management solution, Chaincerts gives users full control over their identity data, enhancing security and privacy. Soroban smart contracts are responsible for generating and managing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and issuing Verifiable Credentials (VCs) – two integral components of Self-Sovereign Identity systems. The DID enables users to control their identity without relying on centralized authorities by providing a unique, decentralized identifier. On the other hand, VCs are decentralized attestations that verify an individual's claims and achievements and are linked to the user’s DID in the Stellar network. Chaincerts' identity management is therefore tamper-proof, secure, and verifiable. It allows users to share their verified credentials while maintaining control over their data.",,,https://chaincerts.co/get-started,https://github.com/kommitters/chaincerts-smart-contracts,https://vimeo.com/854163543,,,,,,,"Miguel Nieto, Juan Hurtado",,https://co.linkedin.com/company/kommit-co,https://twitter.com/kommitco,,

Quasar a Soroban indexer.","Why? Because by providing pre-built templates and complex contracts that developers can use with 0 setup we supercharge the growth of the community and the Soroban ecosystem. We have been watching closely since 2014 and even though Stellar is a solid foundation as it is with its scalability, interoperability and speed, Soroban will unlock so much more potential with Rust based smart contracts. We want to help build it. The idea is to create a library for Soroban smart contracts similar to OpenZeppelin. In contrast to OpenZeppelin it will not have ERC-20 or Proxy contracts because those are available in the core Soroban offering but it will have additional mathematical, cryptographic components and on top of that it will have a showcase of complex systems like Stake controlled governance or yield bearing instruments. Goals: Attract rust developers from existing web3 ecosystems and potentially web 2. Build a simple wizard for users to build their contract thru a pick and choose interface similar to OpenZeppelin contracts. Make it easy for all developers to onboard and build with Soroban. Build a complex stake controlled governance dao contract to showcase more advanced uses. This proposal also includes the beginning of another tool, due to lack of writing space in the form, Quasar details are attached at the bottom of the pitch deck: Quasar - A Soroban indexer - GraphQL APIs, Indexing and analytics of the Soroban ecosystem. We believe that Nebula will be a valuable tool for the Stellar community, making it easier to get started and build commercial products on top of Soroban and thus strengthening its long term ecosystem. Attached to this submission is a pitch deck, please use that one to get a comprehensive idea of the vision. Here is a list of possible smart contracts/tools to add to the SDK they have noted down on our internal update yesterday on Friday: Auction, Coin Flip, Lottery, MarketPlace, FundMe Contract, Raffle, Math (SafeMath + SafeDecimalMath), Pause Contract - Allow pausing some transactional process, Payment splitter, Reverse billing splitting, Voting facilities. Other projects in this space we could collaborate with: Tenzing Catalog - An excellent idea to showcase contracts.

We came up with our own proprietary algorithm and single-token staking design. We are the top stableswap on BNB Chain. We have also successfully launched on Arbitrum achieving a total of ~100M TVL within 5 days of Arbitrum launch.

How we add value to Stellar and Soroban ecosystem: Utilizing the Wombat proprietary and innovative algorithm and design, Wombat adds value to Stellar through: For swap users on Stellar, swap stablecoins and LSDs on Stellar at hyper-efficient exchange rates with minimal slippage, minimal gas fee, and high speed, directly on our website or through aggregators (to be integrated). Liquidity providers can earn sustainable and optimal yields on their Stellar assets via single-asset staking pools (without having to be forced to deposit in pairs) with minimal impermanent loss effect directly on our website or through our yield boosting ecosystem partners. For stablecoin/LSD projects in the Stellar ecosystem (especially for new players), Wombat maximizes capital efficiencies and kick starts their liquidities to fuel growth and adoption through our proprietary algorithm and design which is battle tested even during volatile markets (an example in practice was being to do 8x+ our TVL during USDC depeg incident). New DeFi projects’ liquidity is most important in any sort of DeFi ecosystem for new projects to flourish. Wombat’s algorithm can maximize capital efficiency hence maximizing liquidity. For lending, leverage and yield boosting projects in the Stellar ecosystem, Wombat’s single-asset liquidity position design allows easy building of flexible DeFi products on top of our LPs, adding value to interoperability between Stellar DeFi legos.

More details on Wombat’s proprietary and innovative algorithm and design: Scalable equilibrium: Innovative coverage-ratio-based stableswap mechanism that removes scalability barriers, which allows the possibility of achieving 100% capital utilization with minimal impermanent loss and no limit as to the number of assets within one single liquidity pool. Slippage minimization: Wombat’s capital efficient algorithm and unique design enables lower slippage compared to our contemporaries. User-Friendly UI/UX: Simple and accessible interface with pure single token pool design. Foundation for DeFi to build upon: A pure single-token pool design enables single-token LP tokens, ideal for borrowing and lending protocols and trading platforms to build on top of.

Comet,SCF #18,Comet - Weighted Pool AMM,Comet,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recIRbsKDA1ayFXCF,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$141000.00,$141000.00,1183978.50,9/6/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,Comet is a weighted AMM protocol that offers Soroban projects a flexible solution set when picking liquidity venues,"Comet v1 created a solid foundation for users to engage with a weighted AMM implementation. An efficient set of smart contracts with an example frontend users may easily fork and build on top of was introduced. Comet v1 also set the stage for enhanced interoperability within the Soroban ecosystem, as our core smart contracts serve as a foundation for many other solutions to integrate/build on top of. This framework enables robust exchange of assets across a dynamic set of liquidity pools. However, while Comet v1 offers robustness, it lacks fluidity in regards to cost optimization, this impacts end user experience.

Enter Comet v2, a major upgrade that optimizes for low fees via order routing and the implementation of stableswap pools within the weighted pool AMM. Why router? A router is a user-friendly way to interact with an AMM, it handles the routing logic for facilitating swap and order execution. Having an efficient router can lower fees for end users significantly. This is especially important for a weighted pool AMM, as Comet will have a variety of pools with similar tokens of different weights. One pool may have XYZ token with a 20% weight, and another pool may also have XYZ token at a 50% weight. The router will find the most optimal path for swapping from token a to b, with the functionality of being able to route across a multitude of liquidity pools. This allows the user to have access to efficient swap routing without having to worry about using specific pools and thinking heavily about liquidity implications for simply swapping tokens. The router takes weight distribution, liquidity, fees, and efficient path finding into account when facilitating a swap.

Why stableswap? Stablecoins have become a unique and integral part of capital liquidity throughout many DeFi ecosystems. Stableswap implementations allow for a novel approach to reducing fees and enhancing price stability. Having an efficient stableswap implementation with the Comet weighted pool AMM would also allow for greater real world value within the DeFi ecosystem, as stablecoin issuers and/or protocols can confidently allocate liquidity within a plethora of weighted liquidity pools. Users also gain access to distributed risk profiles across multiple stablecoin pools, with the ability to group various types of stablecoins by weight while still benefiting from the low slippage associated with a stableswap liquidity pool. Stableswap pools also allow for more dynamic route pathing options within the router implementation.

In conclusion, Comet v2 introduces two major new features, a router and stableswap implementation. Users will have access to lower costs when they provide liquidity to and/or swap stablecoins (lower slippage and impermanent loss), as well as lower fees (efficient routing) via the router implementation. The net result will mean that regardless of what tokens users choose to swap, they will incur lower fees, and thus will enjoy a much greater end user experience.",,,https://github.com/CometDEX,https://github.com/CometDEX,https://vimeo.com/854223209?share=copy,,,,,,,"Ignacio Garcia Leon, Tempest ",,,,,
HiYield,SCF #18,HiYield,HiYield,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recjwQ8Ebg6OIV4BT,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$150000.00,$150000.00,186439.62,7/27/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,HiYield: Aggregating liquidity for the market’s top real-world assets through the HiYield lending market,"HiYield aggregates liquidity for the increasingly fragmented tokenized RWA (real world asset) market using its custom-built HiYield lending market. The HiYield lending market has a unique architecture ideal for tokenized assets, enabling both borrowers and lenders to maximize returns on tokenized assets, participate in pre-vetted offerings from both public and private markets, and access deals from other partner tokenization protocols. The problem HiYield addresses is the growing fragmentation of the RWA market. Liquidity Fragmentation erodes the benefits of tokenization, hurting investors and new protocols alike. HiYield addresses this problem by aggregating liquidity into the HiYield lending market, pre-vetting opportunities on our platform, and allowing investors to access the market’s best deals all in one interface.

The HiYield lending market consists of a passive lending pool with broad exposure to all tokenized assets and a number of isolated lending pools against an individual collateral type. It comes with several benefits for both borrowers and lenders:

Lenders:
- Flexible credit risk by lending in isolated pools that match your risk-profile
- Flexible duration risk by lending in isolated pools that match your investment horizon
- Lend in the Passive Pool if you don’t want to actively manage your position
- Lenders receive a variable interest rate based on the utilization percentage and borrow rate of the pool

Borrowers:
- Borrow against your tokenized assets to purchase more tokenized assets, achieving a leveraged return
- Borrow against your tokenized assets to purchase other assets, increasing yield on all your investments
- Borrowers pay a fixed interest rate

Our asset offerings fall into 3 categories: Public Markets, Private Markets, and On-chain markets. Public markets include US treasury bills, corporate debt, and asset-backed securities. Private Markets include products like invoice financing, and on-chain markets include working with existing tokenization protocols on other networks to re-issue their tokens on Stellar. HiYield offerings are SEC-exempt “Private Placements” (RegD/S). Private Placements are open to accredited US investors and all non-US investors. Additionally, we keep the offerings at 9 months or less to maturity, which removes the 99 investor limit resulting in no minimum investment size. We work with a top law firm with extensive experience in the blockchain industry to ensure our offerings are compliant.

HiYield earns revenue by charging a spread on the interest earned off-chain vs the interest offered on-chain. For example, a tokenized asset might earn 10% yield on-chain, while the off-chain assets earn 12%. In that case, HiYield would earn 2%. The more offerings that HiYield makes on Stellar, the more revenue it will generate. HiYield completed a proof of concept on Ethereum aggregating ~1.2M in total USDC deposits across two product offerings, a 2 month treasury bill and a line of credit to HiYield.",,,hiyield.xyz,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWLSxNPTszw,,,,,,,Scott Smiley,,,https://twitter.com/hiyield_xyz,https://discord.gg/5kgC3WYxKR,

This will, in the first phase, foster fast and secure payment settlement on Stellar. The resulting payment toolkit can be used by developers within the Stellar ecosystem. In a future proposal, these payment channels can be extended to State Channels or other functionalities such as cross-chain swaps (see Outlook).

Perun Channel technology enables fast and cheap transactions on and across blockchains. The technology is based on peer-reviewed research that has been published at top conferences and is being implemented in the form of the open-source library go-perun written in Go. One of its main features is its blockchain-agnostic design, which means that most parts of the library do not depend on a concrete blockchain implementation, but are rather implemented against abstract blockchain backend components. Currently, we have backends for Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano and Hyperledger Fabric.

We propose to adapt the go-perun framework so that two-party single-asset payment channels between users on Stellar can be created, processed, closed and disputed. We propose to release this work open-source under the Apache 2.0 license.

We currently focus on two-party single-asset payment channels between users on the same Stellar chain. For the future, we consider adding state channel functionality, multi-asset support, multi-party support, and cross-chain functionality for establishing channels between Stellar and all other chains supported by Perun.",,,https://perun.network,https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun,https://youtu.be/hUHEiVOBeCw,,,,,,,"Hendrik Amler, Hendrik Amler ",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/perun-network/,https://twitter.com/PolyCrypt_,https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1082054199187083264/threads/1129011157789851748,

Cross-border remittance is notorious for high fees and inconvenience. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that recipients are often poor, underbanked, and are the least able to afford the fees and the time to deal with money agents. Crypto shows promise by removing some of the fees. Stellar's integration with Moneygram is another step in making crypto more usable for remittance. We believe there's a further opportunity to improve usability by off-ramping directly into a recipient's mobile e-wallet, and that's what we're building for this project.

Mobile money has existed for more than a decade, with M-PESA in Kenya being the first practical and well-known deployment. The idea has evolved, and mobile e-wallets such as Alipay in China and UPI in India have shown mobile money's new power given the recent ubiquity of smartphones. Many countries, such as the Philippines, have learned from China and India and have developed their local versions. During the COVID lockdown, the adoption of these mobile e-wallets exploded as everyone needed an alternative to physical cash. We see this as an opening to provide digital services to the unbanked that were previously stuck with the limitations of the cash economy. Cheap and convenient cross-border remittance is the next natural step to build for e-wallet users.

We’re building the anchor around the SEP-24 standard, so it will be compatible with all standard Stellar wallets. We plan to use Beans as the reference wallet as we have had the founder as our mentor during the SCF Startup Camp. Specifically, we plan to use Stellar's Anchor Platform for Hosted Deposits and Withdrawals to ensure standards compliance. On the other side, we're working with GCash to integrate the payment function to deposit Philippine pesos into a user's e-wallet. From a user's point of view, within a Stellar wallet such as Beans, when choosing to cash out into Philippine pesos, we will show up as one of the options. After choosing us, if it's the first time the user uses Ripe, she'll be asked to provide her KYC and GCash account information. This naturally includes a phone number (which is how one identifies a GCash account), and we'll send an OTP to ensure the user's association with the phone number. Afterward, and in subsequent visits, she will simply be asked to enter the amount to cash out. Our service will clearly show the exchange rate and any associated fees.",,,https://ripe.money/,,https://www.loom.com/share/90953a5aeff94595bdec3c1b365925eb,,,,,,,"Chuck Lam, Sam Silver",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ripemoney/,https://twitter.com/RipePayments,,

Bloom is a smart-contract suite for on-chain entity assembly. By using Soroban smart contracts, we aim to provide a more efficient, transparent, and streamlined solution for building on-chain entities. The main smart contract we are building will act as the on-chain entity, handle all asset issuance logic, and be capable of interacting with other smart contracts and creating assets with different properties, visible on-chain, including all asset types available in tradFi today plus all others that can be created via smart contracts. This will allow companies to have more control and clarity over their on-chain entities (and assets) and greater flexibility in the functions and processes they execute, bringing them closer to a DAO-like governance than is currently possible in Stellar classic. This will also make Mojoflower-created entities less dependent on a centralized company (like Mojoflower) for handling their assets.

Petal is a decentralized document signing service that stores signatures and document/contract receipts as an enhanced ERC721 smart contract on EVM equivalent chains and L2s (Arbitrum/Polygon). The flow is: 1. A user connects using a wallet of their choice. 2. Uploads documents to IPFS and inputs which entities to gather signatures from and optionally how to send them a notification of where to view and sign said document. 3. The possible signees view the document and choose whether to sign or reject. When they have chosen their action, the signature for that action is requested from their wallet and stored on-chain with the NFT representing the document in question. We want to build a Soroban version of the document signing service plus add Stellar wallet signing capabilities.

We are enabling the traditional financial system to reach a hugely in-need underserved population through a unique and proprietary driving credit score that replaces outdated inefficient risk assessment mechanisms. We are the company behind the tech: we have a mobile app with a fiat wallet, a 100% automatic back-office platform and a behavioral scoring engine that can effectively capture the risk of the customer segment we are trying to serve.

In emerging markets, inflation forces users to find alternative ways of storing value. Argentina is one of the Latin American countries hit hardest by ever-increasing inflation. With an average annual inflation rate of 24% over the past 20 years in Argentina, the depreciation of the peso ranks as the most relevant issue for Argentines. To protect themselves from devaluation, people typically preserve their wealth by exchanging the Argentine peso for the US dollar. This process usually involves opening foreign bank accounts and holding onto the physical bills at home. This leaves them with no safe way to store or use their money.

We want to enhance our value proposal, adding a USDC alternative account to our existing fiat wallet. After the implementation of the blockchain-based wallet, the user will be able to receive a Stellar address automatically, right after his KYC has been accepted. If they want to buy (or sell) USDC, they will get the transaction quote automatically in real time. We will collect the corresponding amount from the user’s national currency virtual account and will send the corresponding USDC balance to their Stellar address in a few seconds. This new feature will provide our users a new saving strategy in countries where unstable economies push them to escape from their own currency because of its constant devaluation. This happens in Argentina, where we are already operating, and other Latin American countries.

We have participated in the Stellar Community Bootcamp where we had the chance to design, prototype and validate our ideas with real users. During the interviews, 8 real users of our wallet were invited to complete 2 different processes. First, the purchase of USDC using available funds in their fiat wallet. Second, to perform a cashout of USDC to a different account. Our users are not familiar with crypto so we did some research on that as well. From all the users interviewed, only 2 mentioned that they are able to save, but 7 said they would do it through our wallet… one of them wanted to do it NOW! A few learnings in the process: wording is important… withdraw and transfer may not be understood the same way; security during cashout… some users mentioned they wanted to schedule an “automatic” purchase once they collected their wages in the wallet; and some minor details but really useful to learn!

""International Pix""","Although I believe that there'll be multiple use-cases for Soroban on Emigro, it doesn't make sense for me to start there. I have to get payments working and get a client base on the core product, before working on more sophisticated features. The first product is a smart-phone based cross-border payments app for retail tourism-related payments, whereas the tourist and vendor will both need the app at this time, but with the goal of moving towards app to account payments. A tourist will pre-load their (recoverable) self-custody Emigro wallet through an anchor in their home country, via the Emigro interface. They're then able to travel to other countries and make cash-less and card-less retail payments where Emigro is accepted for their trip expenses via QR codes containing the vendor info plus the payment details for them to scan. With path payments the currency exchange, at the best rate, and payment is completed at the point-of-sale, therefore a traveler doesn't need to exchange and hold currencies other than their own. But, the ability to exchange and hold other currencies does exist if the traveler/vendor wants to hedge against fluctuating exchange rates. The payment will settle instantly with the vendor in the currency that they chose and can be instantly off-ramped to their bank account by their home country anchor via the Emigro interface. Although fiat-backed stablecoins are used, (with XLM as an intermediary), the traveler/vendor doesn't need any knowledge of crypto, and all of the confusing web3 UX is stripped away. The traveler/vendor doesn't have to deal with gas or wallet address strings, their wallet key is their email address or another code they choose, mimicking how Pix operates in Brazil and that others will follow. This is a safe way for people to get started with and use digital currency, and can be a gateway for future products. There are problems solved for both the travelers and the vendors; Travelers - no need to exchange and carry cash for regular tourism payments, saving money and also being less susceptible to losing money via theft - no need to carry credit cards for regular tourism payments as they're not universally accepted, the vendor may add a fee to accept the card, and international cards are not available to all (plus their high fees) - transparency regarding the fees involved in making payments, with the small on/off ramp fees, but free transfers (payments) and no markup on the exchange rate Vendors - no need to hold large amounts cash from tourism clients, with more safety and no in-person bank deposits required - no need to have a point-of-sale credit card machine if you are a very small vendor, or you can save money by accepting fewer credit cards as a larger vendor. there is also more access to consumers as only smart phones are required for the payments - instant settlement with no charge-backs, and the ability to immediately send the money to a bank account or another user (free)",,,https://emigro.co,https://github.com/EmigroBR,https://www.loom.com/share/1f929397e299445eb29581448018236c,,,,,,,Blake William Sieders,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/emigro-inc/,https://twitter.com/emigrobr,,

Available within Basement’s free tier, for a testnet and its mainnet once ready. Indexing can be an expensive and time-consuming task. We assume crypto startups spend on average at least one FTE in engineering costs for their data pipelines. This data is essential to build business logic and interfaces for protocols. Basement reduces this to as little as a few lines of code, saving engineering teams tons of time. This time can now be dedicated to work on product features instead.

An indexer extracts and transforms historical and real-time data from a blockchain and converts that to a format or a set of APIs more suitable for developing applications. Indexers are crucial because execution layer nodes are optimized for write performance, resulting in slow response times when reading large sets of data. Basement connects this data to warehouses such as Postgres and Parquet, which are more suited for reading data on a large scale.

There are three different indexers we're building here:
- Tip of the chain: To keep data real-time, we'll leverage the getLedgerEntries and getEvents RPC methods to extract new data and store that in our data warehouses used by the SQL/GraphQL API.
- Archival: To verify state and backfill historical data, we'll build a service that parses history_archive files from Tier 1 validators. This data will then be transformed to our custom schemas and loaded into our data warehouses. Developers can then query these through SQL and GraphQL APIs in a performant way, without having to sift through these files themselves.
- Custom primitives: Some events, such as TokenTransfers, are stored in a different table, with indices on common fields. Because these events are commonly queried, we want to make sure developers can query them without having to parse these themselves.

With SQL, developers can query transactions, events, and decoded data. With the click of a button, these queries can be turned into production-grade RESTful endpoints. SQL is well-suited for advanced analytics of on-chain interactions. Our customers on other chains use this to measure usage of their protocol, build graphs, and classify potential users based on activity. The entities that will be available through SQL are Transactions, Events, TokenTransfers, and TokenContracts. These entities can be queried through a PostgreSQL-flavored query language, using our SQL IDE available on basement.dev.

All entities in SQL will be available in GraphQL as well. GraphQL is better suited for quick data access directly in a builder's app or interface and is easy to use through our JavaScript SDK. GraphQL also offers other quality-of-life improvements, such as batch querying contract state such as Balances and Name Services, automatically decoding XDRs when available, and paginated data for easy integration into any interface.",,,https://basement.dev,,https://www.loom.com/share/722a10598eb34fefbc93ad34b15f3d50,,,,,,,Nick Vernij,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/82955478/,twitter.com/basementapp_xyz,discord.gg/rr5R7UYvGC,

Developer productivity relies on having great tools and that includes an industry-grade IDE. In addition to a great IDE, you also probably rely on a multitude of other tools to get your job done. Currently, Stellar/Soroban development requires you to switch between quite a few tools: the Stellar Laboratory, the Soroban-CLI, RunKit, Postman, curl, and your own scripts and code snippets, among others, to leverage core features of the platform. While there are online solutions (specialized IDEs) helping users to streamline workflow, and they are great for your first steps, once you deep-dive for a while you outgrow them very quickly or find their features limiting. Also, having to “learn” how they work, only puts more cognitive load when you are already on a steep learning curve for Stellar/Soroban.

The Solution

Why re-invent the wheel? Let’s Stellar/Soroban-ize a tool already used by millions: Visual Studio Code.

The roadmap ahead

Our extension will provide easy access from within Visual Studio Code to built-in Soroban platform services and features, such as: Calling RPC/API endpoints, such as getLedgerEntries, getTransaction, and sendTransaction. Translate XDR to/from UTF-8. Create and Send Transactions (local and on-chain) in an easier manner. Manage Identities such as Accounts and Contracts. Manage Networks and Server connections. View and record Events, with filtering support. Download contract code, so bindings/interfaces can be extracted. ... among others.

The roadmap even further ahead

Visual Studio Code also runs in a web browser: www.vscode.dev, and while not all extensions can be added and used in that environment (there are certain restrictions), it certainly does potentially allow to have a fully-featured, completely web-based Visual Studio Code user experience (no local installs and cloud-based development flow). The current problem (which can be solved by using remote development and/or Codespaces, but both of these solutions are cost-prohibitive), is related to usage of the Rust toolchain currently required for Soroban development. Once this general problem is solved, our solution could be deployed to Visual Studio Code on the web, making it the #1 developer choice for building projects, which unfortunately can result in downgrading of other Stellar/Soroban-specialized online IDEs currently out there (or make them more of a user choice or preference).

A note on global audience

There are no distribution restrictions on Visual Studio Code extensions, so our potential market is every developer wanting a better experience when building Stellar/Soroban projects. However, we do want to point out that we plan to launch v.1 with i10n support, and we will support both English (default) and Spanish.",,,http://www.sorobanide.com,,www.sorobanide.com/notreleasedyet,,,,,,,Matias Wald,,,,,

With 500k+ developers from top universities, companies, and projects across the US, UK, and Europe, EasyA has grown into one of the world’s most trusted and engaged developer communities in the last 3 years. EasyA developer projects have been funded by a16z, Polygon Labs, and many other top VCs. Founded by Oxbridge/Ivy League grads, EasyA works very closely with 250+ of the world’s best blockchain clubs, frequently ranks as one of the top apps on the App Store, and has been featured as Apple’s App of the Day. Our crash courses and hackathons with the world’s leading Web3 networks such as Polkadot, Algorand, Polygon, Tezos, Binance, ImmutableX, Solana, and many more attract the world’s most talented hackers, since EasyA is a powerful signal to them of quality and excellence.

The Problem: Why does Stellar need EasyA? Most developers think Stellar is only a payments/asset-transfer network. They don’t know about the huge opportunities Soroban will unlock once it brings smart contracts to Mainnet later this year. Soroban therefore needs to inspire these developers to attract them to build in the ecosystem. This is of paramount importance to securing Stellar’s position as a world-leading chain. Soroban needs to: Increase monthly active Stellar developers via EasyA’s unique, direct-to-developer channels. Teach developers about the novel use-cases Stellar is looking for, so these can inspire more developers to build on Stellar. Build a funnel of top projects for VC funding. Boost Stellar's Electric Capital score by actively increasing GitHub repository activity. Via this proposal, EasyA will target all 4 of these goals and ensure Stellar cements its reputation as a world-leading chain for all builders and innovators (not just for payments). The secondary effects of this will also be very powerful. Increasing developer activity will itself improve the perception of Stellar in metrics tracked by builders when choosing a chain (such as the Electric Capital / a16z Developer Report).

Target audience: Builders who want to found their own startups on Soroban. Web2/Web3 developers who want to learn about Soroban but just want the technical TL;DR. Students who are excited about Web3 and want to build their BIG idea on Soroban.

How: Through Stellar educational content in the EasyA mobile app, EasyA gets its unique network of the world’s best developers (in the US, UK, and Europe) learning about and building on Soroban. Via the EasyA app, we will funnel a consistent and proven pipeline of top developers into the Soroban ecosystem. These developers will be from EasyA’s huge network of 500,000+ developers at top institutions from Harvard to Meta to Google and other leading Web3 projects.

Problem: Limited Access to Traditional Financial Systems. Significant unbanked population. Solution: We provide people with access to a broader range of payments services and the ability to use their Stellar funds in real-world transactions, even if they have no bank account! Comments: Main Stellar FIAT Anchors focus on banking integration, which is great considering that banks are the primary providers of ""traditional finance"" services. However, it raises the question: What about the unbanked population? World Bank data reveals that approximately 50% of Argentina adult population lacks access to formal financial services or a bank account, driving retail transactions to heavily rely on cash. Problem: Complex Fund Movements and Transaction Tracking Solution: Our service simplifies the process of request, load, unload, track their transactions and balance in real-time by ensuring full compliance with SEP-6 and SEP-24, enabling seamless interaction with any anchor. This solution also implies modifications to the current SEPs versions due to the fact that SEPs doesn’t consider this use case in detail. Audience: Our service benefits any platform that integrates with Stellar and have or seek to have users in Argentina. It is particularly useful for those who face limited access to traditional financial systems, bank account, or those who prefer to avoid the banking system.

Slender is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetual) or undercollateralized (single block liquidity) fashion. The interest rate in Slender is dynamically determined by the market supply and demand mechanics. Therefore, the borrow and supply interests could vary in different blocks. The main factor which the interest rate relies on is utilization which represents the relative amount of borrows to the total cash in the given market. Classical protocols such as Aave and Compound utilize step-wise functions to control interests when utilization is high. We propose to use a hyperbolic function for the same purposes, as it's smooth, doesn’t have any inflection points, and behaves similarly in nature. Slender codebase will serve as an important resource for the growth Stellar DeFi ecosystem. Providing a secure Soroban proof-of-concept implementation of the codebase will make it easier for new teams to enter the ecosystem and begin building.

DAO treasuries, crypto funds, crypto native startups, and Crypto OTC desks sit on large amounts of stablecoins and other crypto assets. The DeFi TVL crashed after Q2 2022, so most crypto native assets are not participating in the DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, real-world assets such as Treasury bills and Agency-backed MBS in the US have become productive due to the rising inflation and central banks who have responded by raising rates. This has increased the rate of high-quality fixed-income assets such as US treasuries and RMBS securities. The prominence of real-world fixed-income assets is here to stay as the era of quantitative easing and free money is ending. This means that the DeFi native assets would remain uncompetitive with the real-world assets unless the inflation rates in the real economy go down significantly, which is an unlikely scenario based on historical patterns.

What are the products

Excellar will create two products on Sorobon, Excellar Mint, which will be used for asset tokenization, and Excellar Repo (xRepo protocol), which will be a repo-like lending protocol. Excellar Mint will tokenize public and private funds holding real-world assets. Note that the tokenization platform will be hosted at http://excellar.finance. Excellar Repo will allow token holders to borrow stables against those tokens unlocking liquidity for the short term if needed. Note that the lenders of stables on the Excellar repo lending protocol would differ from the borrowers due to their different liquidity, duration, and risk tolerance profile. Note that the tokenization platform will be hosted at http://xrepo.finance. Further, crypto holders can borrow stables against their crypto from DeFi protocols such as AAVE and then use those stables to mint the tokens and earn higher net rates on their crypto as the rates on real-world assets will be higher than those in DeFi. This will also push up DeFi rates.

Excellar Short-Term US Government Treasury Fund (XUSG)

Fund Holdings: Our first tokenized fund (XUSG) would be a Short-term US Government Treasury Fund holding iShares Short-Term Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: SHV) and cash. The ETF documentation is available here https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239466/ishares-short-treasury-bond-etf. Transparency: The fund administrator is an independent service provider who does an independent valuation of the fund and publishes a Net Asset Value (NAV) at a frequency specified in the fund prospectus. The administrator also publishes reports of the asset holdings of the fund. This fund is a typical Regulation D private fund offering in TradFi, where investors receive a prospectus, limited partnership agreement, and a subscription document. Together these documents detail the operations of the fund, the assets holdings, and details of the service providers, such as the fund attorney, administrator, and auditor. Please note that we will tokenize more funds in the future, each with a clear specification of the fund asset holdings in its prospectus. Full documentation on the tokenized fund and the repo-lending protocol is available here.

Tracee promotes financial inclusion in MENA and empowers humanitarian organizations and businesses through innovative and user-friendly cross-border payment solutions. Tracee fulfills the day-to-day needs of organizations and individuals in a region with high potential, but lacking serious and efficient payment solutions (34% of 500 million owns credit/debit cards).

How? Smart wallet: To create a seamless UI/UX, Tracee removes the need for private keys and seed phrases while still enabling users to maintain custody of their funds. With just a phone number, millions of users can access a digital wallet. To achieve this, we use SEP30, a user-friendly key management protocol (link here).

Bulk payments & Stellar Aid Assist (SAA): Aid delivery and bulk payments can be costly and very slow for NGOs, especially during emergencies. Last-mile cash-aid delivery poses safety risks for transporters and collectors and is susceptible to fraud. NGO operators and recipients often lack knowledge of operating in the web3 space. Solution: We provide a user-friendly interface to easily on-board thousands of NGOs and millions of recipients (individuals in need & employees). We scale SAA to allow orgs to send bulk payments and recipients to withdraw cash at any MoneyGram location.

Payment streams using Soroban: Tracee simplifies the process of recurrent bulk payments and payrolls for NGOs by deploying Soroban to automate the process. This involves setting payment conditions, such as multi-sig and recurrence intervals, then the payment is executed by smart contracts in accordance with the conditions. Check out in product viz the detailed sequence diagrams.

Smart contract escrow-service using Soroban: Tracee uses Soroban as an escrow service to hold funds for service payments. The sender fills the provider & the service details as well as payment terms, which are confirmed by the provider. Smart contracts hold the funds and release them based on the agreed terms. See the sequence of events in product viz.

On-ramp / Off-ramp solutions: SEP06 is used for deposit and withdrawal API/SDK, without leaving the app. Tempo is considered for credit cards and SEPA transfers. SEP24 is employed for hosted deposit & withdrawal with MoneyGram.

Stellar network: We use Horizon SDK to connect with Stellar network as well as several SEPs: SEP-10 for authentication of users, SEP-12 for communicating user KYC information, SEP-30 for private key management, SEP-31 for processing cross-border payments.

UI/UX: Click here to test the prototype.

KYB: Partnering with tier-solution provider, mainly Sumsub.

KYC: It is made through via off-ramp partner.

The project architecture is illustrated below & describing the communication between the front-end, the back-end, Stellar & anchors. The use-cases of Soroban are considered upon the release it on the main net, more info about its implementation is in the ""product viz below"" and in ""Additional info"".",,,https://traceeapp.com,,https://youtu.be/f1GAuCGwpZc,,,,,,,Bassel Assaad,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/traceeapp,,,

The system resembles a bill payout system except: The person paying the bill and the person receiving the bill are in different countries; At the moment of settlement the merchant gets paid in USDC, on soroban, via a smart contract that automates and controls payments. This system solves problems for the three key stakeholders in our cross-border-payment scheme: Migrant abroad: Is able to pay for their family’s needs back home, and doesn't have to pay an enormous fee for the cross-border txn. Also knows their money is going where it needs to go (the SME business). Family back home: Their bills are paid by their migrant family members abroad. Small business: Improves income as they received extra sales, paid in USDC, a dollar backed stablecoin which also is used to store value giving the business more flexibility in inflationary countries. The Soroban component works as part of our payments architecture: The process starts with a business registry, displaying a range of clinics, and products from within those clinics. We start with hospitals & pharmacies then expand into other services. Next step is the payment, which happens through integration with a cash-in gateway, and crypto conversion (Moonpay or more efficient solution). The ecosystem is managed in an internal admin panel, similar to an ""Uber for drivers"" where caregivers (clinics) sign in and provide the needed KYB to be accepted into our marketplace. Initial sign ups will be handled with a Business development team, where the Unalivio BD team, vets, and signs up more clinics, labs and care providers. After having the cash in system and service ecosystem ready, we deploy the smart contract on Soroban: 1) Soroban’s contract will serve as a part of the back end infrastructure to automate payments, eliminate human error in crypto addresses input, & minimize the need for trusts of administrators when input amounts. In short, the Soroban contract works as an automated, transparent treasurer. 2) Recipient's Stellar wallet(s) are registered including services, costs, and payment amounts for a payment to be triggered for their services. 3) Once a threshold is reached, the smart contract is triggered, and a payment is made to the defined wallet. This allows for automation and serves for a trustless, efficient, accurate, automated way to perform payouts and settlement, while combining the benefits of low cost transactions that are transparent, enabling improved KYC possibilities for all parties involved. 4) Once per cycle, an administrative report is created, and can be confirmed with the smart contract for added transparency and external audits for administrative, KYC and other purposes.",,,www.unalivio.com,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQLj3DWPps,,,,,,,"Ernesto Contreras , fabians19, Yenderlhy Zapata ",,,https://x.com/somosunalivio,,

The Problem: As of today, it’s challenging for users in Africa to onramp and offramp directly on any self-custodial wallets or dApps using their local payment methods like mobile money wallet, USSD, or local bank transfer, because most of the global fiat on-ramping solutions mainly focus on ACH, SEPA, and credit card payments solution and none of them support the traditional payment rails in Africa. Solution: Paychant solves this problem by providing a simple and customizable fiat on-and-off-ramp SDK that supports a broad range of localized payment methods in Africa, which are mobile money wallet, USSD, or local bank transfer, allowing users in Africa to easily on-ramp and off-ramp right inside any self-custodial wallets, DEX, dApps, or NFT platforms.

Our project seeks to address this problem by creating a secure and reliable decentralized escrow solution that can be used to protect security deposits and later also be applied for buying properties. Our solution will enable renters to place their deposits in a secure, decentralized escrow account that cannot be tampered with. By using Soroban's unique capabilities, we can create a transparent and efficient system that will provide peace of mind to both renters and landlords. With the support of the Stellar Community Fund, we will be able to accelerate the development and launch of our escrow solution on the Soroban blockchain. We believe that our project will make a significant impact in the real estate sector in LatAm, and we are excited to bring it to market.

The technical user flow will be: Using Soroban SDK we will build and deploy an escrow smart contract to act as an intermediary between tenants and landlords on a MicroService that will be created and consumed from our platform. We will build and deploy first on the testnet, of course, initially, it will receive the damages schema (agreed by both landlord and tenant). The smart contract will have methods to receive and lock the money, finalize and unlock the money, receive updates regarding the possible damages to the property, and use the storage to update it once the rent contract is finished. This Smart Contract will be used for all the rent contracts so it will never be invalidated. When a rent contract is signed, the tenant and landlord agree on the percentages to be deducted for each type of repair, and an instance of the Smart Contract will be signed by both users and with Mica as an intermediate. That Smart Contract instance will be provided with the same Id from our database and with the damage type and percentage defined and agreed upon. Both Landlord and Tenant will sign the token through us. A custodial wallet will be used for this purpose. We will be receiving the payment and moving it from FIAT to USDC using an anchor (we are having conversations with Bitso). The Smart Contract instance will execute the method to lock the money, which will receive the contract duration and deposit amount, and the security deposit will be locked. We would like to explore the possibility of Stellar products or programs where we could invest the USDC for the whole rental period generating profits for the tenant, landlord, and Mica. The Smart Contract method to update itself with the possible damages will be executed 15 days prior to the rental contract ending with the data of the inspection and evidence of the damage provided and define how much of the deposit will each part receive. Once the rent ends, based on data provided from the previous step, the money will be unlocked and returned via anchor and split as per defined by the Smart Contract rules.",,,https://mica.rent/,https://github.com/MicaTechnology/escrow_api,https://youtu.be/f9LOY-T3Pto,,,,,,,Julian Stastny,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/micarent/,,,

In addition to our flagship oracle product and network, we’ve just launched a verifiable random function (VRF), which allows smart contracts to securely generate a random value and provide proof. BandChain is based on Cosmos SDK, designed to be compatible with all smart contract platforms and blockchain development frameworks. In a trustless and decentralized manner, BandChain does all the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating, and packaging them into a format that is easy to use and cryptographically verified across multiple blockchains. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, BandChain is designed explicitly for oracle data requests and computation. Data request transactions are both received and resolved very quickly, with an average block time of 3 seconds. We currently provide cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices on 19 chains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Cronos, and we've also integrated with multiple projects on their testnets. Band Protocol works with different chains and Defi apps like lending protocols, perpetual protocols, and yield protocols to feed them accurate real-world data. Furthermore, our data source scripts and oracle scripts allow maximum customization and flexibility for the user to query and compute their desired data feed. As for our VRF, randomness is a fundamental function that helps to operate many decentralized applications (dApps). However, the root and foundation of this vital randomness mechanism are often neglected. Band’s VRF service addresses the fundamental issues that threaten the integrity of various Web3 use cases by providing a pseudorandom output along with proof of authenticity that validates the random number generation process.

They are widely applied in lending schemes that incorporate approaches like overcollateralized loans. Decentralized systems require a secure and reliable way to access external data, especially when it comes to financial data that impacts decision-making within the applications. Since blockchain networks are typically isolated from the outside world, price oracles act as a bridge between off-chain data and on-chain applications, ensuring accurate and trustworthy information for users and developers. Major oracle disruptions could endanger billions of dollars stored in Soroban-based agreements. Recognizing the focused risks is crucial, as the ever-expanding assortment of projects within the system typically hinges on a few price oracles. A breakdown in even one of these oracles might trigger a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem. As a result, the seamless integration of dependable and secure price oracles is crucial for the success of Stellar Soroban.

We previously developed LightEcho.io, an aggregator that compiles pricing data from various sources, including Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), Centralized Exchanges (CEXs), Instant Exchanges (ICE), and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) exchanges. It collects data from over 50 sources. This platform showcases Stellar pricing information. For this project, we aim to create two distinct types of oracle contracts within the Stellar Soroban ecosystem: An embedded oracle, in which all prices are stored inside the contract data on-chain, and the prices can be obtained at any time by invoking the contract function directly from another contract. A callback-based oracle, in which a price is requested alongside a contract ID for receiving the price later, then a backend aggregator (off-chain) detects the request via getEvents, and invokes the receiver contract, passing the price as a parameter to the function being invoked. The sources of the prices that are fed into those contracts will be decentralized, meaning there will be multiple sources, each one controlled by a different trusted market data providing company or exchange. It's on the consumer (of the contracts) to decide which price source to rely on when retrieving a price. For the centralized pricing systems we will both investigate using the pricing model from CME and use a hybrid model taking the best of Maker Dao and Cornell University's ""Town Crier"" model.",,,https://lightecho.io,https://github.com/bp-ventures/lightecho-stellar-oracle,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PVzH-2mo4sSiwOLdjhASIy74EuBzh6t2/view?usp=share_link,,,,,,,"Anthony B, Christian Aleksander Larsen, Jeff Phaneuf",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bpventures/,https://twitter.com/lightechoi/,,

Decentralized identity enables a trustless, portable, self-sovereign identity that removes reliance on centralized entities for authentication, authorization, user data and KYC/KYB.

Decentralized identity has a multitude of potential use cases, including Universal logins, KYC/KYB, Voting, Proof of human (sybil protection), Lack of ID problems exploited by human trafficking and forced labour, Product provenance. DID is not a new concept, and virtually all leading blockchain platforms have implementations of the DID standard. An interoperable and portable decentralized identity implementation is one of the public goods that support effective decentralization in a privacy-preserving way while enabling interaction with advanced use cases that require some user authentication. DIDs have seen adoption across end-user identity, organization identity and supply chain identity use cases. DID is an open and interoperable standard that is garnering adoption from both the public decentralized platforms as well as centralized entities (major financial institutions, multi-national oil and gas operators, U.S. government). The DID:STELLAR project will implement the DID spec in general, similar to the way DID:ETHR project implements DID on the Ethereum Blockchain. More specifically, as part of this grant we will implement the following DID infrastructure: A DID:STELLAR Method, DID method resolver, Management of the DID Document using the smart contract including Delegation, decoupling claims data from the underlying stellar address and support for existing stellar multisig capabilities, Integration with the Universal DID Resolver.",,,www.mavennet.com,,https://www.loom.com/share/702bccd1b1544af3902c7a78440e9382,,,,,,,"Patrick Mandic, Patrick Mandic ",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mavennet,Mavennet_,,

This type of protocol is useful in many situations, such as a DAO giving out grants. In this case, the DAO can give the grant out as a streaming payment and can cancel the stream when the recipients are not making progress. The protocol will be composable and allow others or me to easily add extra functionality. For example, I am planning to make it possible to use a portion of the stream to invest in other tokens periodically.

Features I am currently planning these features:
- Basic functionality: Users can create streams and recipients can withdraw from streams by using a web app.
- Top-up streams: The creator of a stream can add additional funds to the stream.
- Transferrable streams: Streams will be represented as tokens, which will allow the recipient of a stream to transfer a portion of the stream to someone else. Representing the stream as tokens could also be useful in other ways, such as allowing wallets to notify a user when a stream was canceled.
- Infinite Streams: Streams can have no end date. This allows for some interesting applications, such as streaming funds to a DEX where the funds are then exchanged.
- Partial conversion to other tokens: Recipients will be able to invest a portion of their stream into other tokens. Funds will periodically be withdrawn and invested. This feature will charge a fee.

Use cases:
- Grants: Organizations can use SStream to pay out grants. A cancellable stream can be created per grant. The organization can cancel the stream if the grant recipient is not fulfilling their obligations.
- Salaries: Imagine receiving a portion of your salary every second.
- Subscriptions: Imagine subscribing to a service where you pay per second and can cancel at any time.
- Daily cost average buys: SStream can be used to DCA by creating a stream that periodically converts funds into other tokens.

Challenges: I want the system to be composable. However, this means that the system has to work in many different scenarios and that I will have to consider many different factors. For example, someone can send some of their stream tokens to another user and the other user can keep claiming before the first user is able to. In this way, they are doing a sort of denial of service attack. I will offer services that will rely on keepers. I need to determine the frequency that the keeper calls the contract, such that it is frequent enough to be useful but keeps costs low. I may have to rethink some parts of the system depending on how high the gas fees end up being.

Architecture: The system will consist of a core contract that handles the stream behaviors and another contract that handles integrations with other contracts. A backend will keep track of users' streams and a Keeper will be responsible for periodic token exchange. The diagram gives a nice view of the architecture.",,,https://github.com/rahimklaber/SStream,https://github.com/rahimklaber/SStream,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW2L_agVIX8,,,,,,,Rahim Klabér,,,,,

To counter this, we've initiated the development of a server owner signup and bot deployment feature for our web application. We have also constructed prototype smart contracts designed to deliver the functionalities we envision once Soroban is fully integrated into the Stellar mainnet. Although member voting capabilities aren't functional on the mainnet until Soroban's activation, we are in the process of conducting tests on futurenet. Our team has developed a prototype user interface for effective interaction with these smart contracts. Our goal is to further integrate Soroban functionality into our Stellar wallet client, a move that will empower Dapp developers with easy access to contract invocation, token deployment, token wrapping, and more. In terms of augmenting the bot's functionality, we will be introducing inter-server operability. This feature will enable users registered on one server to automatically receive eligible linked roles on other servers where the bot is deployed, streamlining user experience and fostering community integration across servers. By the end of stage 2, our objective is to deliver a fully functional DAO bot that any Discord community can utilize to deploy a DAO, either using their existing assets or employing the bot's built-in badge and role creation functionality to deploy new assets to the Stellar network. Our top goals for stage 2 include: The addition of a 'new community signup' feature, offering both free and premium features. This will not only create a revenue stream for the bot's hosting and maintenance costs but also empower communities to deploy their own Discord applications. Our application will host these for them, providing the required functionality. Importantly, deployment will not necessitate developer skills, and will allow white-labeling the UI for each server. The development of an open database of communities, to allow anyone to learn about a DAO, and view their governance history, as well as participate in governance if they are a member. The introduction of inter-server operability, eliminating the need for users to link their Stellar accounts multiple times. The development of advanced tooling functionalities, such as ledger data caching for quick accessibility and verifications. The provision of multiple options for DAO contract deployment to accommodate a variety of requirements. This includes classic asset adapters using Stellar Asset Contracts or Soroban-only tokens, alternative voting methods supporting a single token for DAO management instead of NFT badges and roles, new proposal creation methods allowing proposals to be highly customizable by their creators.",,,https://github.com/communidao,https://github.com/communidao,https://vimeo.com/836040845,,,,,,,Tim Baker,,,,https://discord.gg/trppmYjVJJ,

Stellar SEP6 enabled anchor crypto on/off ramps: Allows users to easily convert their traditional currency or assets into cryptocurrencies such as USDC that can later be used on the Stellar network. Building SEP6 enabled anchors gives Pactta a full perspective of the whole Stellar infrastructure technology and allows us to provide the most competitive fees in the market. This also addresses the lack of operating ramps in LatAm to exchange local currencies into USDC and back for retail customers.

2. Cross-border payment API: A tool designed for any businesses in LatAm to easily and securely provide cross-border payments to its users. Pactta's API orchestrates and connects two of the many crypto on/off ramps (either owned by Pactta or some of its partners) to send and receive borderless payments using USDC on Stellar as a non-custodial conversion mechanism. Our API takes care of all KYC requirements on both anchors and offers competitive exchange rates. Pactta accepts different payment methods and supports local currencies in LatAm such as ARS, CLP, COP, PEN, MXN, and BRL. Pactta is the layer that many non-crypto fintechs need in order to be able to access the cross-border payment technology of Stellar, without needing to understand blockchain, SEPs, or protocols.

3. Fiat to fiat widget: A white label, easy to integrate, and user-friendly tool that enables our customers to offer fiat to fiat conversion quickly using our embeddable interface. This widget provides real-time exchange rates for the different fiat currencies, the payment methods available, and the KYC requirements. This way our customers can start generating a new source of revenue within their platform, eliminating the need for their users to cash out their wallets and use third-party services or navigate complex currency conversion processes.

4. Business dashboard: This panel helps our customers manage payment statuses, download reports, and visualize financial data, all in one place. It provides real-time insights and analytics on performance, and also customization of widget and fees.

Our mission is to simplify the process of managing smart contracts on Soroban by addressing the current lack of standardization and efficiency in publishing, deploying, invoking, and upgrading contracts. Smart Deploy provides a comprehensive solution by introducing a DAO specifically designed for publishing contracts. Developers can easily publish their contracts on our platform, enabling seamless tracking of metadata such as versioning and source code location (e.g., GitHub repository). This ensures transparency and allows for easy reference and collaboration. Once published, contracts on Smart Deploy gain a unique and easily accessible ID, making them human-readable and facilitating efficient deployment. Our platform also offers a standardized interface for invoking deployed contracts, promoting easy integration with various applications and services. This eliminates the need for developers to spend time and effort on complex integration processes. One of the key features of Smart Deploy is its emphasis on safety and upgradability. By utilizing semantic versioning and leveraging the power of the DAO contract, developers can confidently upgrade their contracts to the latest version. Each decision regarding upgrades is made as a team, ensuring transparency and collective agreement. Smart Deploy's user-friendly interface and standardized processes streamline the entire contract deployment workflow on Soroban. By alleviating developers' concerns about technical complexities and redundant work, our platform empowers them to focus on building exceptional applications. With Smart Deploy, developers can maximize their productivity and creativity, driving innovation and growth within the ecosystem. We are confident that our platform will revolutionize the way smart contracts are managed, opening up new possibilities and opportunities for the Stellar and Soroban communities.

This is achieved through creating a wizard which guides builders through functional and business requirements to automatically create a production-ready smart contract which can be deployed on Soroban to quickly bring the idea to market.

Smart contract development is too risky and resource intensive for most builders. This tweet about a talk by Tomer Weller summarizes it perfectly. A technical founder may spend hundreds of developer hours of a huge amount of resources to turn around a smart contract. Deployment is risky, and design considerations may limit scaling. Instead, we propose a standardized and scalable wizard which reduces the barrier for founders to bring a product on Stellar to market. Our intuitive front-end combined with a library of secure smart contract components merge together to create a developer experience that focuses on functional design and will save time and resources. In summary, Sorosorcerer makes building production-ready custom smart contracts on Soroban easy and accessible. Specifically, we propose to include components that will compile into three different contract types: 1) fungible asset contract (50% complete) 2) Non-fungible asset contract 3) governor contract. More will be added over time using the best in class and trusted components developed by the community or other projects such as anchain.

As our mission is to reduce the barrier for entrepreneurs to build impactful use-cases on Soroban and Stellar Network, we are building developer tooling specific for Stellar and Soroban. We will take advantage of all the interesting and unique protocol level features that differentiate Stellar's native assets (i.e. authorization required, revocable) as well as extend these features with custom contract code using Soroban (i.e. pausable). Combining the two is very powerful as for some use-cases a builder may be satisfied with a Stellar native asset and in other cases the use-case would be better suited on a Soroban custom asset contract. Sorosorcerer abstracts away these technical considerations and creates the optimal contract code based on the functional and business requirements. We also plan to investigate opportunities to integrate or load contract code into other development lifecycle tooling such as IDE's or simulated playgrounds. Examples include smartdeploy and usesoroban.",,,http://sorosorcerer.com/,https://github.com/NossicaSystems/soroban_extend,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJi7fTW8N-0,,,,,,,"Vincent McLeese, Vincent McLeese ",,,https://twitter.com/EfikoDLT,https://discord.gg/5mxkqWaX7F,

The DEX will serve as a cornerstone of the Phoenix and Soroban ecosystems. Phoenix should not be thought of as “just a DEX” or a singular DeFi product, rather it should be regarded as a suite of synergistic DeFi applications designed to synergize with all other Phoenix products to drive outsized value accrual.

Initially, our DEX will launch with features found standard on many DEXs, such as swaps, adding liquidity, creation of xy=k pools, and allowing liquidity providers to earn rewards. We describe this initial deployment as Phoenix DEX ""Phase 1"". Having studied several DEXs, we have identified the unique needs of both liquidity providers and traders. The needs of both traders and liquidity providers are our North Star in how we approach product design. Traders desire low fees, low slippage, fast order execution, and a variety of trending and ""blue chip"" assets, while liquidity providers want sustainable yields, reduction in impermanent loss, low “hold up” of liquidity, and certain quality of life features such as auto-compounding. Our DEX and our future suite of products will leverage Soroban’s 5-second finality and 150 TPS to provide DeFi users with a seamless and high-speed experience.

As additional Phoenix products are launched in the future, the utility and features of the DEX will become richer for Phoenix users. When Phoenix Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) assets are launched, these assets can replace the underlying base assets in a liquidity pool, which allows liquidity providers to earn more sustained yields which will help offset impermanent loss. By making Liquidity Providing more attractive, we expect higher inflows of liquidity to Phoenix, which also reduces the slippage for traders. When lending and borrowing are released, underlying LP positions (LSD based) can serve as collateral for borrowing, further increasing capital efficiency within the Phoenix ecosystem. This will also add greater utility to LP positions, which should also be accretive LP TVL. Additionally, by allowing users more access to capital we also expect an increase in trading activity and in trading fees. By offering lending and borrowing on LSD assets, collateral depositors can earn underlying compounded staking yield on top of borrowed interest.

Over time Phoenix DEX will iteratively upgrade beyond Phase 1 as the products mentioned above are launched. With each product launch, Phoenix DEX and the Phoenix ecosystem will provide more utility to the Soroban ecosystem. We are submitting this application to fund the deployment of Phoenix AMM DEX Phase 1. We intend to submit future applications for LSD and Lending & Borrowing to further upgrade the Phoenix DEX to strengthen the utility of Phoenix and the Soroban ecosystem.",,,https://github.com/Phoenix-Protocol-Group,,,Yes,,,,,,"Milan Steiner, Jakub#2923 ",,,https://twitter.com/PhoenixDefiHub,,

The objective of the EURC Soroban project is to provide a subset of the utility of Stellar Classic natively on Soroban. This would lead to the following benefits: Smart contract developers on other Blockchains will be motivated to build on Soroban using the EURC Soroban token. This is because the wrapped EURC Soroban token will implement the token interface on Soroban which follows the EVM's ERC-20 token standard widely used on other blockchains that support smart contracts. More dApps with utility will be built on Soroban because the EURC Soroban project code is open source and the cookbook implemented will make it easier for developers building on Soroban to adapt the project code for other use cases.

It has explored the possibility to build a Supply Chain Financing (SCF) platform on Stellar and released a preliminary product for customers. However, the smart contract and USDC were not available by then. As a result, Stellar blockchain could only play a limited role in the system. With the progress in Soroban and the growth of the ecosystem, as well as the ongoing demands from our SCF customers and partners, we decided to build a web3 native SCF platform on Soroban. The platform facilitates the decentralized financing of aspects of the real-world business operations such as trade receivables and invoices natively on-chain, creating a fully transparent market which allows creditors (lenders), suppliers (borrowers), and buyers to transact without unnecessary intermediaries. Credit is essential for economic development and business growth. Only large businesses get direct access to liquid capital markets. This same access is not available to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). The average cost of capital for the Global 2000 is ~1%, compared to >15% for SMEs. The lack of an open and transparent marketplace denies SMEs access to competitive borrowing rates. In our platform, suppliers are subject to a fair, but rigorous due diligence process to build trust between all the parties involved. In the medium term, suppliers on the platform will be able to reduce their cost of capital and improve payment terms by building a track record in repayments. Our business model is based on taking a fee for connecting suppliers and creditors thereby providing transaction funding, supported by dynamic risk analysis and reporting that gives visibility and transparency to all parties (Platform, Creditor, Supplier, and Buyer). The proposed platform will automate the entire process on-chain and settle the funds in USDC on Stellar, including: The Creditor confirms terms and conditions with the Buyer. A loan smart contract is initiated on-chain. The Supplier uploads the invoices to the platform. The Buyer validates and confirms the invoices. As soon as the invoices are confirmed, they will be minted as NFTs and airdropped to the Supplier's wallet. The Supplier could split each NFT into multiple NFTs which are the accounts payable (this Supplier owes to other suppliers). These NFTs received are locked in the same loan smart contract, then these suppliers receive the factored amount in USDC on Stellar. When the terms are up, the Buyer pays in USDC to all NFT holders at the face value. The USDCs are provided by the Creditor. This demo video explains how the platform works with an example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eNEOysY6ipZtq7lMMO_lx-uLFVnmBv-J/view?usp=share_link.

We offer seamless Stellar-based payments and plan to expand into user-friendly smart contract access for everyone. To achieve this goal, we are launching new products and services:

Beans check-out: We will extend our payment requests to web so that (Soroban) projects or webshops can integrate with Beans and use our cash (Moneygram) and bank on/offramps. At check-out, a project or webshop generates a ""Pay with Beans"" QR code through our public API. They can set the amount, currency, destination address, webhook callback, and optional memo. A Beans user scans the QR and pays with their preferred currency. Via webhooks, the project will know the payment has completed, offering an experience just like any other web 2 check-out!

User-friendly deposits: We have seen that users find external webviews scary. This is why we are looking to offer in-app KYC and deposits through SEP 6 and 12.

Beans for Bitcoin: Users will be able to deposit and withdraw native Bitcoin through an integration with Coinqvest BTC (SEP 6). This will allow users from the (large) Bitcoin community to use Beans as a Bitcoin payments app, buy BTC with cash, as well as ""upgrade"" their native Bitcoin to one that interoperates with Soroban smart contracts.

Send to phone numbers: By building on SEP 30, a user can send a payment that can be claimed by a new user during sign-up in a non-custodial way.

Integrate smart contracts: By integrating Soroban, we will be able to offer many new services. The first use-case we will integrate is recurring payments, which our users will be able to set up from within the app. To realize this, we will need to integrate with a .NET Soroban SDK. Currently, the elucidsoft SDK is implementing Soroban, but they said they're short on time.

Price provider feed is managed by a network of trusted nodes controlled by reputable organizations. Each of them continuously monitors Stellar network for new trades to determine fair prices for every tracked asset. The account which controls oracle price feed contract is protected by M-of-N multisig, so any price update or contract code modification requires a confirmation from the majority of the participating organizations. Nodes periodically generate transactions to update the price feed contract internal state with new prices. Those transactions get broadcasted to other peer nodes to aggregate signatures. Since all servers run the same codebase and take snapshots at predefined timeframes, the generated update transaction should be always identical for all servers, unless they are lagging significantly behind the consensus. Once the transaction gathers enough signatures to match the threshold, it is submitted to Stellar network. Consequently, fresh price data becomes available to all consumers. Consumer contracts can fetch price data for any asset tracked by the oracle following the recently proposed oracle interface SEP. Aside from standard methods that allow retrieving price only designated in a base asset, we also provide automatic cross-price calculation for any pair formed by two arbitrary assets quoted by the oracle and automatic TWAP over the requested range.

The focus of Trilobyte will be on facilitating trade, working capital, and other cash flow finance transactions (Cash Flow Financing) for Latin America and the Caribbean (LATAM+C). These loans are expected to be executed between parties experiencing difficulties contracting the finance they wish to contract for reasons relating to trust, shortcomings of the financial markets they operate in, local currency convertibility issues, geographic bias, or global regulation limiting their activity, among others. Trilobyte will provide the necessary infrastructure to connect whitelisted borrowers with investors, allowing the former to borrow digital assets against expected future cash flows, as a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to what is available in local or international financial markets.

Trilobyte’s ecosystem will consist of five key entities:

- Borrowers: Reputable organisations searching for working capital to finance their operations.
- Borrower’s Vault: The equivalent to a loan in traditional finance, the Vault is a special-purpose receptacle for receiving the agreed cash flows. It is represented by a smart contract on the Stellar Soroban platform. Vaults can be permissioned or permissionless.
- The Payment Actors: Payment Actors are third-party vehicles through which the cash flows that serve as the source of repayment are channelled in a Cash Flow Financing lending scheme. Payment Actors can be independent persons or entities who regularly pay funds to the Borrower in the normal course of the Borrower’s business activities. These are generally the clients or customers of the Borrower’s business or other parties, such as management entities or electronic payment platforms, who owe regular payments to the Borrower in the normal course. These regular payments constitute the cash flows that can be captured in a cash flow finance scheme by directing the Payment Actors to make all future payments to the Vault for subsequent redistribution between the Investors and the Borrower in accordance with the agreed terms of the transaction.
- The Investors: Private individuals or entities who will transfer digital assets into one or multiple Borrower Vaults in exchange for future yields.
- The Treasury: Initially managed by the Trilobyte team, the Treasury will whitelist Borrowers, create Vaults, and ensure that Payment Actors meet their agreed payment obligations. A DAO is expected to manage the Treasury in the future as the project scales.",,,https://trilobyte.finance/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-n0uLIQXhQ,,,,,,,Yulexi Matienzo,,,,,

With SDK and easy to use frontend.,"The Soroswap Protocol is planning to launch the protocol itself (smart contracts in rust) and its ReactJS frontend. In order to do this, Soroswap will support and develop the @soroban-react library, which allows to connect frontend with smart contracts. All products will be 100% open-source.

1) Smart contracts. Provide the ability for users to swap their tokens inside Soroban, as well as for developers to connect their Soroban dApps with the protocol. Written in Rust, inspired by UniswapV2. Include:
- Factory contract: Creates one Liquidity Pool Token contract per unique token pair.
- Pair contract (Liquidity Pool Token contract): They serve as automated market makers (AMM) and keep track of pool token balances. These contracts will implement the token interface.
- Router contract: Supports the basic requirements of a front-end offering trading and liquidity management functionality. Supports multi-pair trades (e.g. x to y to z).

2) The Soroswap front-end: Convenient and user-friendly front-end written in ReactJS and inspired from the famous Uniswap UI. Uses the @soroban-react library in order to connect the protocol with Stellar wallets. Smart contract and front-end audience: any user wanting to swap a token (or provide liquidity) inside Soroban, without needing to use the classic Stellar chain’s AMM, or because they are using a token that was issued inside Soroban and cannot be “unwrapped” to the classic chain. It is also useful for other protocols that need to swap tokens (e.g., a multi-currency NFT marketplace, where the seller wants a certain amount in a certain coin and the buyer can buy with any currency available in the Soroswap protocol).

3) The @soroban-react library: Framework for building modern Soroban dApps using ReactJS. Its development will keep the library updated with the latest versions of Stellar’s libraries and previews. Soroswap will add support for other wallets and write documentation.

The main features we already have is USD Savings: In Latin America, it can be difficult to open a USD bank account, and the banks that do offer this service often require a high initial deposit. Meru solves this problem by allowing customers to deposit local currency, which is then used to mint USDc (USD coin) by Circle over the Stellar blockchain. Each user has their own Stellar wallet, so the USDc is deposited directly into their wallet. 

Low-cost International Money Transfers: Sending money between countries in Latin America can be difficult and expensive. Meru solves this problem by allowing customers to send money to more than 13 countries in the region. The app uses Stellar to send the payment from the user's wallet to Meru's treasury wallet. Meru then sends the money to the Stellar wallet of a partner company that handles liquidity in most of Latin America. This ensures fast and low-cost money transfers. 

Earn Up to 7% APY: Meru allows customers to earn up to 7% APY (annual percentage yield) on their investments. The app uses the yUSDC asset from UltraStellar to offer this feature. Customers can invest their money and earn interest without worrying about scams. 

Pay Utility Bills: Meru allows customers to pay their utility bills using their USDc balance. The app partners with a third-party company to exchange the USDc for local currency using the Stellar DEX platform through a local market maker.

Those who receive a redeemable voucher can spend its value in the merchant. Our product addresses pain points for migrants in the US and recipients in Colombia.

In the US: Red tape: With KometPay, users can send money in three simple steps by simply selecting the recipient’s phone number. No need to include unnecessary banking details. Exchange rates: With KometPay, senders don't need to worry about the exchange rate: they can send dollars and the recipient will receive dollars. Allocation of resources: Another concern for senders is how the money is spent. Through KometPay, they will be able to select a merchant (pharmacy, supermarket) and send a voucher that will only be redeemable in the selected merchant.

In Colombia: Dollar account: Our USDC wallet and voucher credit protects Colombians from the volatility of the Colombian peso. They can choose to spend all or a partial amount. Access: Colombia remains a cash-based economy with a largely unbanked population. Our partnership network ensures that everyone, regardless of access to banking tools, can withdraw their Komet balance.

KometPay leverages Stellar at every step of our flow of funds: Through our integration with MoonPay, we ensure that the sending user can onramp USDC on Stellar. The USDC will be sent to a Komet wallet issued on the Stellar network, which will allow our Colombian users to store USDC or a USDC-backed voucher.

Having an automatic and easy way of testing or writing tests might give Soroban smart contracts an edge against the competition by minimizing losses in the ecosystem and community. We propose an AI fuzzer and test generation for Soroban smart contracts. It would be a model trained with reinforcement learning and its goal would be to cover every code block in the least amount of calls. Later, a detector and parser of the blockchain state would be needed to determine if the state is valid or not or if certain accounts received funds they weren't supposed to. We see many ways to explore this problem: aim for a model that covers most of the lines/blocks of code in the least possible number of calls, use the training process as fuzzing, and use user annotations and code parsers as an additional source of information for training and fuzzing. The most important information includes code branching and reading or writing to memory.

Additionally, we aim to develop a web app that would allow server owners to deploy DAO contracts, issue community NFT assets, manage their Discord community, create proposals, vote on proposals, and perform other tasks that would enhance the functionality of their community. Currently, interacting with DAOs on Ethereum and other networks is quite expensive, which limits its practical functionality. However, this problem does not exist on Stellar, which provides greater functionality and can support more users. As a result, our approach involves creating a customizable web app that enables server integration and setup specifically for Stellar and Soroban. To accomplish this, we will be developing a smart contract based on Open Zeppelin's governance API, which will be customized to our specific needs. In order to facilitate interactions between the users and the DAO, we will be using a Discord bot. Admins will be required to hold a certain asset in their account, and users will be issued assets that can be used to moderate the server, and interact with the DAO to vote on proposals. This will enable members to participate in the decision-making process. We will also be developing a web app to aid managers in interacting with the smart contract, issuing assets, and performing other moderation tasks. The administration UI will be accessible only to admins who have verified their Stellar account. With this, they will be able to add or remove other admins, create or remove roles, and define role requirements. On the other hand, users will be able to read, create, and vote on proposals, such as voting on new members and budgets.

Users can choose between Open Source (self-hosted) and Subscription-based (fully managed).

The problem: A simple business concept for a remittance product is quite simple: Onramp USDC using Moonpay, create a custodial account, exchange to ARS, and offramp using Anclap. To achieve this, a developer must understand the particularities of the network: An account must be created, and perhaps it has a signer added to it for security purposes. A trustline to the USDC asset must be created. The asset must be exchanged to ARS (Payments, DEX, Liquidity Pools). Understanding of the various SEPs to withdraw. Early-stage startups trying to build on the Stellar network face talent shortage at an adequate price; when developers that aren't familiarised with the Stellar network take on one of these projects, the time to market is increased due to the steep learning curve.

The solution: Intended to be used by early-stage startups and developers, Flow offers pre-built building blocks with best practices in mind and is built on the shoulders of battle-tested workflow tools such as n8n.io (https://docs.n8n.io/embed/white-labelling/).

How it works: Similar to Pipedream, n8n or Zapier; Developers need to drag & drop blocks that represent each of the steps of a workflow, and complete the relevant information in each step. One account can have unlimited workflows created. Stellar Flow will provide drag & drop building blocks to create accounts, make payments, connect anchors, execute Soroban smart contracts, and much more.",,,https://www.scalemote.co,https://github.com/ScaleMote/flow,https://youtu.be/KAshUstaQc0,,,,,,,Fabricio Leonardo Sodano Pascazi,,,,,

These signatures are designed to be resistant to quantum attacks and could provide a more secure foundation for Stellar in the future.

Implementing post-quantum cryptography in blockchains has several downstream consequences. Signature sizes associated with the standardized post-quantum digital signature algorithms are much larger than the signatures used in blockchains today. Even with the smallest NIST post-quantum digital signatures, public-keys and digital signatures would consume at least 21x and 24x larger than the signatures used in Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. Since every blockchain transaction needs to be signed with a digital signature, each transaction will occupy more space within a block. This means that there will be fewer transactions per block, which results in slower transaction speeds for users and higher gas fees to include their transactions into the highly competitive block. By implementing post-quantum cryptography in blockchains, we are effectively unscaling our blockchains.

Our service is designed to aggregate the post-quantum digital signatures associated with multiple transactions in a block. This will allow the Stellar blockchain to reduce the overhead cost of storing one post-quantum digital signature per transaction, thereby significantly reducing the size of each block. This technique preserves the structure of all existing transaction data and simply replaces the digital signatures associated with each transaction with a single aggregate signature. The output of this project will be a publicly accessible paper summarizing the research outcomes.",,,https://www.btq.com/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCDeQgr4Geg,,,,,,,Chris Tam ,,,,,

Just prior to our brand launch, Soroban was announced as a replacement for Turrets - so we made the decision to get to market using Turrets and continue with the launch with a view to migrate to Soroban as soon as feasible. Our smart contracts control royalty payments and allow the trading of NFTs on Stellar without requiring use of Stroops as the NFT unit. The royalty system enables NFT creators and businesses to provide support for social and environmental causes when they sell or trade assets.

Our current Turret smart contracts:
- Have full authorisation over the NFT assets we mint once the Primary Sale is closed
- They ensure only integer asset transactions take place and avoid the need to use Stroops as the base unit, permitting easier trading
- They control the buy and sell operations which optionally include royalties: 
  1. to the creator of the NFT, as a percentage of all secondary sales and 
  2. to causes the creator would like to support such as charities and nonprofits who receive an ongoing percentage of secondary sales

Our aim with Soroban is:
- Develop Soroban based contracts to replace our existing Turret contracts as soon as Soroban goes live
- Add to our existing smart contract operations so that the new Soroban contracts are fully complete and support all relevant activities required to manage NFT assets
- Work with the Stellar community to ensure the new contracts are as cross compatible and easy to adopt by other NFT platforms and wallets on the Stellar ecosystem

So any business can develop a non-custodial wallet, pack it with the best features industry has: multi-party computation instead of the private key, biometric backup instead of seed phrase, blockchain agnostic signature, DApp browser and much more. Many traditional businesses coming to Web3 and crypto native projects want to step in with their own wallets to give end-users not only unique functionality they have, but also to guide them through Web3. Unfortunately, at a certain point they understand that building and developing a non-custodial wallet is not a simple task - it might take from three months to never. Even those who managed to overcome the initial release face countless support issues. That is where Wallet Builder steps ahead. Wallet Builder is a platform where businesses can create their own non-custodial wallet based on native and custom modules. Such approach allows to significantly decrease the amount of resources required by the business to design, develop, launch and support crypto wallets, and introduce new features. We are distributing our crypto wallet via B2B2C and our potential clients are both traditional and crypto-native businesses. We already have got partners with over 100k users onboarded and we have rather ambitious plans for attracting new clients. Our team is going to implement Stellar blockchain in our Wallet Builder. So the increase in demand for our solution will help the inclusion of the Stellar chain into the ecosystem of our current and future customers and subsequently their users will be able to use the Stellar blockchain advantages.

Qolaq's MAP is a Web3 solution to the restrictive practices and inefficiencies of global health and life insurance, providing the underserved with mutual aid programs that enable Members to support each other in times of need. Qolaq is not an insurance company, so does not conduct underwriting, collect premiums or maintain reserves to pay claims. Qolaq provides programs and the MAP for its Members. Qolaq receives contributions from Members to operate the MAP. Qolaq's MAP follows proven, successful mutual aid models of the past and is developing a Web3 platform with Soroban to facilitate immediate claim settlement and permit Members to collectively decide on claims with full transparency, removing conflicts of interest. Full Member privacy can be achieved while delivering fair and impartial participation. The costs for administering MAP will be transparent and can be recorded on chain. MAP's decentralized approach also removes significant operating costs/commissions of typical insurers. MAP programs are designed for the underserved seeking coverage but either do not have access to traditional insurers, have been rejected due to underwriting requirements, do not understand complex insurance policy terms or cannot afford monthly premiums.

Enter FxDAO, a decentralized borrowing protocol that enables the issuance of stablecoins by backing them up with Lumens. Who will use such a type of protocol? We might ask ""why"" and ""who will use it?"" There are multiple reasons for such a type of protocol or its decentralized stablecoins. Let's list some of them:

- People who want liquidity against their Lumens but don't want to sell them
- People who prefer to diversify their funds between multiple stablecoins; currently, on Stellar, the only highly liquid and trusted stablecoin is USDC
- People who would like to participate in the protocol to earn its asset
- People who want to benefit from rewards given by the protocol
- And many more!

How will it work? We get into more details in our first draft available at https://docs.fxdao.io, but here is a quick view: A core contract takes care of the issuance and burn of the stablecoins. If a user deposits Lumens into the protocol, they will receive 85%* of the value in the stablecoin selected (the target is to have multiple stablecoin denominations, i.e., USD, EUR, etc.). Later, that user can liquidate the position by depositing the stablecoin and getting their Lumens back. *Percentage is from our first draft but it can change during development.",,,https://fxdao.io,,https://vimeo.com/795602494,,,,,,,Enrique A.,,,https://twitter.com/FxDAO_io,,

As the term ""ecosystem"" hints, we envision XycLoans not only as a protocol but as a protocol + other components, making it effectively an ecosystem. There are 4 main components in XycLoans: the smart contracts, backend functions to build a database, scale, and make the front end faster, a web app to graphically develop contracts that use flash loans without coding knowledge, and a high-quality web app for lenders to manage their liquidity.

We have already written the PoC contracts for the protocol, which can be found here. We also already have simple tests that show how borrowing and lending would work and we are looking forward to making more complex tests for edge cases. The specifics of how the protocol works are written in the Litepaper, which we recommend reading (sections 4 and 5) if you wish to understand the math and workflows under the hood when lending and borrowing.

In order to scale more efficiently and make the front ends faster, we'll write and deploy a set of backend functions that listen for contract events such as when the vault mints new fee shares or when the vault pays out the yield to lenders. The functions will subsequently build a database that can be queried by the front end (for example, the total profit of a lending token pool).

Flash loans usually target developers and other DeFi protocols, but having a web app like Furucombo that allows leveraging flash loans and profit from them will expand the target audience also network-wise.

In a DeFi protocol, a high-quality web app that allows investors to manage their money is crucial. This web app will allow lenders to efficiently provide and monitor their liquidity in the various token pools, and know how much yield they are earning.",,,https://github.com/xycloo/xycloans,https://github.com/xycloo/xycloans,https://youtu.be/PUtyb2EE4e0,,,,,,,"Federico Carlos De Ponti, Tommaso De Ponti",,,https://twitter.com/xyclooLabs,https://discord.gg/gGvB2Bj2S5,

It utilizes an N-dimensional surface-based cost function to enable the creation of arbitrary weight, arbitrary asset count, AMM pools. So instead of being limited to the standard 50/50 seen in classic XYK AMM pools, users could deploy 2-asset pools with asset weights of 80/20 or even 4-asset pools with weights of 10/15/15/60. This increased flexibility allows AMMs to serve a much wider array of use cases for users and projects. These capabilities, and their effect on ecosystem liquidity, make weighted AMMs a natural fit for the Stellar ecosystem.

Stellar has persistent issues maintaining liquidity. There are two main ways to address this. (1) you find more liquidity providers - weighted AMMs help here as they make passive token holders more likely to provide liquidity due to impermanent loss reduction. (2) you make liquidity provisioning more efficient – here, weighted AMMs help by enabling AMM pools with more than two assets, allowing asset pairs to share liquidity.

Comet’s codebase will serve as an important resource for the growth Stellar DeFi ecosystem. Balancer is the second most forked AMM protocol, with many forks expanding on the core technology. Providing a secure Soroban proof-of-concept implementation of the codebase will make it easier for new teams to enter the ecosystem and begin building. We will get the protocol audited and release a basic user interface for those uncomfortable interacting with the smart contracts directly on Testnet. This protocol will serve as a proof of concept and will not be deployed on Mainnet. Specifically, this proof of concept will be solely deployed to Testnet, and released as open-source software. As for plans after we develop a Testnet proof of concept, there are none. Comet is designed to be a public good. There will be no DAO or token, just an open-source protocol that any Soroban project can use as a building block.",,,no-link.com/yet,,,,,,,,,"Ignacio Garcia Leon, Tempest ",,,,,

Would you like to get paid through a blockchain, but don't want the hassle of processing refunds manually? Then this Soroban pre-order contract (SPOC) may be for you. SPOC is in an early stage of development. It is ready to welcome external contributors but not yet ready for end-users. The initial contract development is expected to take several months, after which it will enter an experimental phase for some time to come. After all, Soroban itself isn't production-ready yet.

The idea for SPOC originated with a need that Stellarcarbon expects to have in the future. Stellarcarbon buys carbon credits from carefully selected project developers, which can involve a lot of back and forth communication and can lead to relatively long procurement processes. When discussing the volume of credits to be purchased from a particular project, it would be very helpful to know how much demand there is for these credits. Similar considerations apply to other tokenized real-world assets. For instance, someone making boutique hand-knitted sweaters—perhaps with a matching NFT—would like to make these to order. Others who tokenize real estate may want to know which kinds of properties and areas are most desirable for their audience of investors.

SPOC aims to provide a fair solution for both buyers and sellers. It asks the buyer to commit to their order of a product or service by providing an up-front payment for it. This gives the seller a specified amount of time to produce or procure the pre-ordered product. The Soroban contract itself serves as an escrow for payments and ensures that all specified terms are followed by both the buyer and the seller. The payment is either unlocked for the seller upon successful delivery, or is refundable to (and by) the buyer when the order expires, and also if the seller needs to cancel orders because their fulfillment isn't possible anymore.",,,https://github.com/aolieman/soroban-pre-order,https://github.com/aolieman/soroban-pre-order,https://vimeo.com/796133624,,,,,,,Alex Olieman,,,,,

CashAbroad is a web platform where businesses in Latam can send and receive cross-border payments from international merchants and vendors with low-cost, instant transactions and a group of smart features that make your paying journey a pleasure.

🤔 Problem

Paying vendors is disorganized and inefficient because approvals, invoices, and payments are often on different channels, like WhatsApp, emails, and paper bills. Moreover, Mexican companies lose up to +9-12% in revenue in cross-border payments and spend up to 30 hours or more a month on payment transactions, a time that would be best spent on strategy. These businesses also struggle with liquidity due to long settlement times, which push them to use credits or loans (more costs!) to keep their businesses running. On top of that, they spend effort and time redoing their invoices due to constant exchange rate fluctuations. We are creating features to help them do their job smoothly and pain-free.

- Pay/receive directly with your local currency to merchants abroad in dollars or their local currency.
- Automatic Payments | Schedule a one-time/recurrent date to pay one or multiple recipients; great for utility bills or salaries.
- Mass Payments | Pay simultaneously to multiple users. Great for paying salaries!
- Invoices | Sent invoices with smart adjustments to request payments (USD/local currency).
- Accounting Imports | Download your transaction history to use it on your favorite accounting software.
- Approvals | Invite collaborators and request approvals, for example, from accounting or you!

With Cashabroad, businesses of small and medium sizes like developing, design, marketing agencies, people that give courses online, consultants, real estate, and others will be able to open their frontiers.

We have been building the infrastructure needed to connect legacy carbon markets with the new digital economy taking place on public ledgers. Other companies building on Stellar will be able to integrate our backend service into their products and services, to give users easy access to carbon offsets. On top of this infrastructure, Stellarcarbon itself wants to develop and launch a retail shop for carbon offsetting aimed at individuals and businesses.

A major problem that voluntary carbon markets have faced over the past decades is low trustworthiness, on both the supply and demand side. While several governance bodies have stepped up to increase the integrity of carbon markets, it is still possible for providers to offer carbon credits without any oversight. Stellarcarbon addresses this problem by only working with a subset of VCS and CCB certified offsets, and by individually vetting projects.

Centralized registries are still essential, and we need to rely on them for the safeguards they provide. Unfortunately, they offer no way to intervene when an offset is used to make inaccurate claims about a company’s sustainability, or is even used to cover up environmental or social damage caused elsewhere. Stellarcarbon will develop terms of purchase that, together with a clawback mechanism, will allow us to invalidate malicious offsets on-chain.

Stellar provides us with the payment rails to fund offsets, and with transparent accounts onto which we can lock a carbon offset. An offsetter can pay with any liquid asset in their account to receive CARBON, select a vetted offset project to fund, and receive CarbonSINK as on-chain proof of retirement. Their offset is recorded in the Verra Registry, and the offsetter receives an off-chain certificate directly from Verra.",,,https://www.stellarcarbon.io/,,https://vimeo.com/753518986,,,,,,,"Alex Olieman, Adam Menary, Henk",,,https://x.com/stellarcarbon,,

By using a Layer 2 payment channel on Stellar called Starlight, we will create the effect of streaming payments. Users will be able to send payments on a per-second basis as they consume any service. Consumers will not be required to pay monthly subscriptions to access streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify or sign up for any service, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords. Consumers only need a pre-funded compatible wallet on their PC or mobile phone and choose what they want to read, see, listen, or use. By further applying this technology, we will develop the concept of payment bandwidth, which will translate to some amount of money per minute or second. Cell phone carriers, for example, could opt to charge different payment bandwidths for 3G, 4G, or 5G pay-as-you-go download speeds.

Today, 70% of Latin America's population remains unbanked or underbanked, and 58% of point-of-sales purchases are still made in cash. Consequently, over 400 million prepaid aggregate service subscribers in Latin America struggle with paying for utility services every month. Being excluded from the financial system and paying for recurring services is not only inconvenient and tiring; it is expensive. When handling prepaid customers, utility companies and merchants are subject to high fees, deductions, commissions from prepaid cards by vendors, and sometimes even interest. Paradoxically, these inefficiencies make the poor pay higher rates for services, making it expensive to be poor.

By building on Stellar, Paystreme will provide the fastest, most convenient, and most efficient way of paying for services. By using Stellar's Layer 2 payment channel, Starlight, we can process over 1 million payments per second per channel, making our platform highly scalable and efficient. Also, by partnering with MoneyGram and Stellar, we will be able to use hundreds of thousands of locations to onboard cash clients onto crypto.

For more info see the “Overview” section.

What problems do we solve?

Kata.Games deletes 3 problems simultaneously:

1) How can one create games and share them online efficiently?
We provide creators with a toolbox and the access (via KataSDK) to a brand new infrastructure. It allows anyone to create, host, share his/her independent game. The key benefit here is simplicity of use.

2) How do players connect with game creators in a fast and convenient way?
We’ve built a proprietary technology capable of “streaming” and running any kind of 2D game in the browser, along with its dedicated hosting solution for games.

3) How to make cryptocurrencies widely adopted widely?
We build a product that will attract and retain a large number of users due to its features and its innovative design. Using the Stellar network adds benefits: for players the diversity of games will be greater (because the barrier to entry is lowered for creators) and players will learn real-world technologies/skills while using our system!

Kata.Games' Stellar integration

Using Stellar allows us to:

- Provide a unified digital identity for the user. Such an identity can be used throughout many games, this is convenient. During registration, every new avatar gets associated with a pair: Stellar address, extra details… Once it’s done the Stellar address contributes to authenticating a user. We use the Freighter wallet at Sign in and Sign up time, and integration of Albedo will be added.
- Secure the ownership of virtual goods. If the user buys a very valuable item in a given game, we will store the ownership on the Blockchain via an NFT. An extra benefit is being able to use the SDEX for trading virtual goods minted by us. Also, we’ve introduced special game entities called “portals”. Every portal is represented by an NFT-like token. Owning a portal implies that you can configure it to redirect to the game of your choice. In other words, you can own a part of our virtual world!
- Enhance the freemium model, speed up microtransactions. Transactions done via our system will be faster and more inclusive compared to competitors. Paying one’s premium status on Kata.Games will be done via cryptos. More specifically, we want to operate like a crypto exchange: fiat deposits will be possible (withdrawals too, but later in our company development) but fiat money will not be used at all when users are active within the system, only cryptos will.",,,https://linktr.ee/katagames,https://github.com/gaudiatech/kengi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyW6XXIGCNo,,,,,,,Thomas Iwaszko,,,https://x.com/createplayearn,,

Kotani Pay SMS/USSD Wallet

The Kotani Pay non-custodial wallet enables both non-internet enabled and internet enabled devices to interact with Blockchain protocols such as Stellar. The user simply dials a short code and is able to transact on the Stellar network. With the SMS wallet, one can receive, send, withdraw and access DeFi services.

We use the Stellar blockchain to hold the digital assets on-chain. The blockchain provides holding accounts for wallet users. The user interacts with the on-chain wallet through a USSD interface. Additionally, the Stellar blockchain acts as the transfer layer for on-chain remittance, cash-transfers, cross-border and gig-work transactions. A user sends funds from their blockchain account to another user’s account via Stellar.

Cashless payments come at the cost of local businesses. In a world where cashless payments are becoming the norm, retailers bear up to 3.5% transaction fees that go to Banks, card issuing Companies and Payment Service Providers. Cashless convenience comes at the cost of local businesses. With the boom of blockchain, more and more customers are hunger to use their digital assets to pay on and offline. But current payment solutions are not network agnostic and replicate the traditional fee-based model, coming again at retailers’ cost.

ABOUT BRAVEPAY

BravePay is a zero fees payment platform that makes cashless payments universally accessible for on and offline retailers. BravePay enables on and offline businesses to receive instant bank card or crypto payments, and safely store transaction value in USDC (Stellar).

But there is currently no way to get an activity overview and easily track the development among different Stellar organisations on Github, understand what is their status, track the contributions made by developers and get an idea on how the repositories evolve. It is really hard to understand how the Stellar ecosystem is progressing since the data is scattered all over GitHub, with contributors, commits, issues, repositories and PRs data.

The solution that CrossChain Labs presents is going to address the problems described above and will offer clarity on the open source Stellar’s developer ecosystem. This will be done by scraping the data related to Stellar’s organisations on GitHub and exposing it in a nicely designed dashboard that allows tracking the number of commits, repositories, contributors, PRs, the top contributors of the month, the evolution of commits and active contributors for each month over the last year and monitoring the recent commits that are being done in the various Stellar organisations.

At its core, the app will feature a decentralized marketplace for documents (including but not limited to sTeX’s) which is built upon the multisig safety of Stellar turrets.

LaTeX is a document preparation system that enables its users to write highly customizable and professional PDF documents. Rather than writing documents with formatted text, LaTeX lets you write documents in plain text, and uses markup tagging to define how the document looks like.

For example, both I and tdep#4794 use LaTeX almost on a daily basis for a variety of tasks: taking notes, product behavior design, writing whitepapers, technical writing, blogging, and working on financial instruments (for writing math).

Most LaTeX editors aren’t cloud-based and require you to install both the app and a TeX compiler as well, and the existing cloud-based LaTeX editors have room for improvement, especially in terms of user experience, interface, and sometimes speed (more on the competitors section in “additional information“). That is why I have decided to start working with tdep#4794 to build a brand-new modern LaTeX editor inspired by Google Docs.

The sTeX app will implement a decentralized marketplace at its core. Users will be able to effortlessly bring sTeX’s documents on-chain and have full control over them (sTeX’s app won’t have any signing power on your on-chain documents).

Once a document is on-chain (as a stellar account), we can officially call it a non-fungible-token (despite not being an actual stellar asset, tdep#4794 will discuss this NFT implementation later on this section). These NFTs can then be traded on a turrets-powered decentralized marketplace. The current progress in the marketplace as well as in sTeX’s “document detach” API endpoints allow to: write a LaTeX document, create that document on-chain, place a sell offer through the marketplace to sell that document at a certain price, and place a buy offer through the marketplace to buy a document at its price.

Thanks to the design of the tokenized documents, they can be edited by the owner, meaning that interesting features like proofed document management can be achieved through the marketplace. For instance, you can issue an agreement contract you wrote to other two interested parties and set that the super-majority (2/3) consensus must be reached to edit the contract (for example three signers with a weight of 10 each and a medium threshold of 20).

The market is non-custodial and decentralized, based on stellar turrets. Turrets were initially called Turing Signing Server since what they actually do is leverage multisig and let serverless workers sign a “contract’s“ transaction. This means that by using more than one turret which aren’t owned by the same entity we can achieve a certain degree of decentralization. We have chosen Turrets over Soroban for a couple of reasons: since we want to keep the document-as-account design, turrets seem like our only option given the limited access of soroban contracts to stellar “classic“ data; we don’t need the degree of decentralization that native contracts offer given the fairly simple nature of our “contract”; it will probably be much cheaper to run the contract on Turrets rather than using a soroban contract (though that’s TBD depending on how soroban’s cost model works out); our contract is on its own concurrency-safe, thus it doesn’t need such model as described here.

Overall, by using Turrets we save time and resources since Stellar already provides all the features we need for this contract.

Lastly, we also mention a possibility for an in-app freelancing mechanism supported by the marketplace, but we won’t implement for now since it would require high community participation in voting for disputes, which is currently out of scope of our app’s simple and intuitive design.

Editor Features: secure and tested authentication and authorization, real-time compiler (our editor will display changes in the pdf as you finish writing your sentences), basic features (create, edit, share, manage access), templates (in development), advanced auto-completion, vs-code alike editor, commenting (in development), multiple themes (in development).

These are the features that are currently present in our editor, but feel free to recommend any that you deem interesting or necessary which we haven’t or aren’t implementing.

In the first submission, sTeX’s goal was to directly store document content on-chain. This approach had some advantages especially in delegating authorization to Stellar validators, and mostly by also allowing non-custodial users in our app. However, tests showed that the approach held important disadvantages in terms of speed and efficiency. That is why we opted to using native storage for sTeX’s API. This does not mean that we don’t use stellar anymore at our app’s core, as a matter of fact, all our infrastructure is made of ed25519 keypairs that are ready to become stellar accounts once sTeX’s users begin creating documents on chain or start interacting with the marketplace. When documents are on-chain, sTeX still enables to modify those documents re-using the code in sTeX’s “first version“ where every update corresponds to a stellar transaction. The only difference is that now users that are only interested in writing LaTeX documents in a fast and friendly environment can do so without suffering decreased speed for something they do not need, and those interested in editing their on-chain documents can do so in a completely non-custodial way by signing transactions as they update their documents.

The above only talks about the Stellar integration in the most “traditional“ part of our codebase (create, edit and share documents), the rest is completely reliant on both Horizon and Stellar (bridge to detach documents, bridge to reattach documents, the DeFi marketplace).

You can review part of our code here, but that’s just the marketplace’s prototype contract since we don’t want to make our API public (maybe yet). What we focus on is balancing and intersecting our “traditional“ codebase with our stellar-based one, and making sure that every interaction with Horizon is non-custodial on the user’s end.

On its own sTeX doesn’t bind much with Stellar being a LaTeX cloud environment, but with the built-in marketplace users who have probably never interacted with Stellar can experience for the first time Stellar in terms of payments speed and ease of possibly making of their documents a source of income.

sTeX’s backend facilitates the process of onboarding on-chain users without storing secrets or adding our signers to the users’ accounts, allowing them to start interacting on-chain on their own and not only through our service.",,,https://stex.xycloo.com/,https://github.com/Xycloo/documents-marketplace-devenv,https://vimeo.com/751354524,,,,,,,"Federico Carlos De Ponti, Tommaso De Ponti",,,,,

Create a wallet to provide the easiest way to create accounts, sign transactions, and store keys securely on users' devices to ensure decentralisation. Ensure the wallet incorporates multiple login/signing popular options such as Albedo, Freighter, Rabet, Ledger, and Trezor. Provide Sep24 payment flows to ensure Stellar Anchor interoperability. Allow simple send and receive features within the wallet session time. Integrate Stellar swap functionality such as those features in the Albedo, LumenSwap, and Xbull wallet.

The Problem: To use the Stellar network, a user needs to create an account on Stellar, fund it via buying XLM to activate it. Then there are three main choices: Install a browser extension, use their private key directly on the website where they wish to spend their assets, or use a hard cold storage type wallet.

Numerous people will find this off-putting due to the cost of a hard cold storage wallet. Simply because those people doing so, many find the concept of installing a browser extension can be annoying or even in some cases too complex. Most users would find this user experience to be too time-consuming and overly challenging. It’s a time-consuming and laborious task that can lead to users like mum and dad or even Granny and Grandad excluding themselves from the Stellar experience.

In any case, “Enter your password to complete this login” is well understood by most. The only way to implement this login otherwise today is to use the private key directly on the website that generates the transaction, but users can’t be certain of what the website will actually do with their private keys.

Storing users' keys securely on their own devices. Enabling users to access their keys for login or signing with finger or face biometrics.

In order to prove that money is not being misused, people have started using the transparent accounts in different ways: Charity cases (e.g. poor families with disabled children receiving donations for basic necessities, churches in many villages and towns raising funds independently to help local homeless people, more recently specific accounts to help Ukrainians in various towns across Slovakia), Amateur sport clubs (e.g. people use transparent accounts to pay for sport facilities and shared equipment), Schools, Hospitals, Public activism (protests, ecology etc.).

Our goal is to research transparency, make transparent data easy to understand and introduce these solutions to Stellar. By extension of Stellar’s mission to bank the unbanked, we want to provide transparent accounts in countries supported by anchors, most of which are in emerging economies, and bring money where it’s needed, while building trust that the funds are spent effectively.

Smilepay is a Peer-to-Peer mobile app and USSD that helps African diasporas send money, buy airtime, and pay utility bills for friends and family in Africa, in real-time and free of charge.

HOW IT WORKS

Both the sender abroad and recipient in Ethiopia download the Smilepay app (recipients in Ethiopia can also use Smilepay USSD). The sender connects their credit/debit card and tops up their Smilepay App. The sender sends money instantly and free of charge to the recipient using their phone number or Smile-tag. Recipients receive money in their local currency. Users receive money in local currency and can spend it in the app to pay bills or buy airtime or withdraw to their bank account remotely, which avoids cash pickups. The sender can also directly buy airtime and pay bills from abroad for friends and family in Ethiopia, allowing them more control over how money is spent.

*Through the Smilepay app, the sender can also send money directly to the recipient's bank account with a 1% transaction fee. It's not a must for the recipient to download the Smilepay app to receive payment, but they can benefit from free transaction fees when they use the app to receive money.

WHY?

High transaction fee by the incumbent: The average cost of sending money to Africa is 8.17%, making it the world’s most expensive remittance corridor. Recipients in Africa have to physically go to the remittance company branch to collect the cash that their family and friends sent them. It's time-consuming and an unnecessary hassle. Senders do not have control of how the money they send is used by the recipients. For example, money sent for utility bills is misused.

OUR UNIQUE ADVANTAGE

We use Blockchain technology to make cross-border money transactions free or extremely cheap. Diasporas will be able to send as small as 50 cents to Africa instantly, 24/7. Other than sending money, Smilepay will enable diasporas abroad to pay for utility bills and buy airtime for friends and family back home, and we are the first to do all of this in Ethiopia.

OUR TARGET CUSTOMERS

Diasporas living abroad that have family and friends in Africa. African youth that have family and friends abroad. Freelance workers that get paid from abroad.

CUSTOMER INDUSTRIES

Businesses that want to sell their services through the Smilepay app (Airlines, Utility companies, airtime distributors, sports betting, and more).

OUR MISSION

Offer free, instant, and frictionless movement of money domestically and across borders to Africa.

*We are starting by helping Ethiopian diasporas living in the USA to send money to Ethiopia.

HOW WE USE STELLAR

We are going to issue a stablecoin that is tethered to the USD and Ethiopian national currency Ethiopian “Birr” and maintain the equivalent fiat reserve with our partner bank. On ramp for senders: We are using “Stripe API” to enable users in the USA to top-up money to their Smilepay app using their credit/debit card.

Sentit,SCF #10,Sentit,Sentit,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec54XD3QmAUoMA1r,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$55000.00,$55000.00,517208.00,7/12/2022,Legacy v3.0 Award,A multi-currency non-custodial Blockchain Wallet with the main Focus on Cross-Border payment.,"Cross Border Payments

Sentit is built for both Cross-Border and Local payments, this is shown in our various types of payment processes targeted at simplifying Blockchain for payments. On Sentit, users can send payment to an email address (new and existing users), public key, and federated address. Users can send the same asset or cross-asset to any of the available payment methods. Below is a short explanation of these features:

1. Email Payments: One of the ways we simplified cross-border payments is through email payments. Sending money across borders should be as effortless as sending an email. Sentit allows users to send payment just by knowing the recipient's email; no public key is required. Just ask for the recipient's email and users can send funds/crypto assets to their email directly regardless if the recipient is registered on Sentit or not. This takes away the issues of users sending payments to the wrong persons and it is way more user-friendly.

2. Public and Federated Address Payment: For experienced users, Sentit is also for you. On Sentit, users can send federated and public key payments too, and all the above-mentioned features are also available for sending payments. This makes Sentit not just a wallet for newbies with no or little blockchain experience but a dynamic wallet that can bend to fit everyone’s purpose regardless of their level of experience with blockchain technology.

3. Currency Swaps: For both experienced and new users, Sentit provides functionality to be able to swap between currencies, crypto assets, tokens, and NFTs at an extremely low fee and fast settlement time. With the recent devaluation of currencies and inflation in most countries, swapping between currencies has been a way to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, and Sentit is the right tool for this.

Bill Payments

Online bill payments have become an essential part of everyone’s lifestyle these days. MTN Nigeria's 2020 financial report shows how bill payment is becoming extremely important not just for Nigeria alone but all over Africa and the world by extension. The group made N332.4 billion in data-related revenue alone with a 51.2% growth in 2020. Sentit allows any user to pay all sorts of bills like airtime, data, TV, internet, religion, educational subscriptions, cable TV subscriptions, and many more using any of their trusted token/crypto assets. This provides users with a wallet that supports their everyday bill payments alongside their crypto assets, giving users the flexibility to pay their everyday bills with just a few clicks. We believe bill payments will play an important role in blockchain adoption for cross-border payments and Sentit is at the forefront of this.

On and Off-Ramp of NGN (upcoming)

On and off-ramp of fiat is a must-have functionality of any cross-border payment platform and with Stellar Standardized Sep006 and Sep024, we provide users with the functionality to directly make deposits and withdrawals of fiat (real-world fiat), tokens, and assets (from other chains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.) directly from the Sentit Wallet. We currently support BTC, ETH, and other ERC20 for Sep006 withdrawal and deposit.

For fiat deposits and withdrawals, Sentit currently supports Sep24. Any assets (fiat) that conform with this Sep Standard, users would be able to deposit and withdraw them to their banks directly from Sentit. We will continue to partner and integrate with more anchors on the Stellar network to provide users with that seamless experience that matters.",,,https://sentit.io,,https://youtu.be/VizpMHxp0TU,,,,,,,Afolabi,,,,,

Most blockchain-based apps have targeted the crypto community. We have taken a different approach and will target the general public. Inside the app, all blockchain-related things have been abstracted away, offering a bank experience using blockchain technology! We are aiming to be the first app to get significant traction on blockchain payments! Next to that, we want to offer regular people a way to access crypto yield by making the process super easy.

The beans app (iOS & Android) offers: Free (international) payments, savings accounts with healthy yields, and an amazing user experience that anyone can understand.

The problem with crypto payments: For a majority of people, the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies is extremely complex and very hard to understand. News media cover stories of heavily fluctuating cryptocurrencies, feeding the uncertainty that people have about cryptocurrencies in general and their underlying blockchain technology. While struggling to learn what it is all about, the uncertainty leads to not adopting a technology that could be very beneficial to a large group of people and potentially change their lives.

Because of this, we want to enable people to start using the great functionalities that these technologies have to offer without having to bother them with complexity. Words like wallet, assets, lumens, and stablecoins do not contribute to a flawless user journey; they only cause uncertainty and scare people away. In fact, why should they even know that they are interacting with blockchain technology, unless they choose to delve into it? People are comfortable using their traditional banking apps without knowing the driving technologies behind them. Why should they bother about it this time?

Our focus has been to build an app that feels like a regular banking app but uses blockchain behind the scenes. To do this, we have chosen to let users pick a preferred currency. This currency will be used to send, request, and receive payments. All payments between users, no matter the currency, will auto-convert. No need to think about currencies or trustlines ever again. Payments are free; we will even sponsor the network fees through feebumps. This is how it works.

Creating an account: When setting up an account, users choose their preferred currency. A spendable balance in this currency is created. In the back-end, they will hold anchored stablecoins on Stellar. By using a fixed currency, we can create a very user-friendly, bank-like experience. We know which user prefers what currency and can use this knowledge in deposits, payments, and payment requests. Users will never have to think about trust lines or choose what asset to send. It will all be seamless. Beans, at the start, will choose one anchor per currency, so that users do not have to deal with this complexity either.

Sending money: When a user initiates a payment, the app will find the preferred currency of the receiver and show the right conversion window. When the user fills in the amount they want to send, in their currency, they will automatically see how much their friend will receive in their preferred currency. When two users have the same preferred currency, no conversion window is shown. In the back-end, a Stellar path payment will be used to convert the funds. Beans uses fee bump and sponsored reserves to offer a bank-like experience without charging fees. This implementation gives users the experience of a general banking app, with the advantage of near-instant, feeless, cross-border transactions. This means that if Ben sends 12 USD to John, John will actually receive 12 USD. No fees, not even network fees are deducted, giving Ben a great user experience. At the same time, Claire can send 15 USD to Mike, who prefers Peso. The app will automatically show that Mike will receive 3,000 Peso.

Requesting money: Users can request a payment via a link, QR code, or other native sharing functionalities of their smartphone. If a user requests money from a user with a different preferred currency, the app will automatically fill in the conversion window so that the paying user can see an estimation of how much the payment will cost them in their preferred currency. All they have to do is accept the conversion and the payment will be done in seconds.

Opening a savings account: Users can set up a savings account in, for example, USD, ARS, and EUR and earn up to 9% yield. More advanced users can also choose to save and earn in cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, or XLM. Conversions in and out of savings accounts will have zero fees, not even network fees. Like we said before, we will sponsor the network fees through feebumps. This way, a user in Argentina can have an ARS account for payments while saving and earning interest in USD. As a result, the user will not only earn interest but also escape inflation. Someone else can choose to pay with USD while saving in XLM, or any other combination. Users can also choose to earn and save in multiple currencies.",,,https://beansapp.com,,https://youtu.be/fsp0L-jiZbQ,,,,,,,"Jop Middelkamp, Wouter Arkink",,,https://twitter.com/BeansApp,https://beansapp.medium.com/,
BP Ventures,SCF #10,BP Ventures,BP Ventures,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec1UP0te2eVEQ6o0,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$125000.00,$125000.00,1175474.00,7/13/2022,Legacy v3.0 Award,Helping FinTechs Leverage Stellar Technologies,"BP Ventures provides Stellar blockchain payment solutions and software development services for Money Transfer Operators, Exchange Houses, FinTechs, Banks, and Telcos that add new revenues, decrease fraud and charge-back rates, and improve working capital and treasury efficiencies.

In particular, BP Ventures fills a vacuum in the market by advising Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and Banks on how best to implement and use Stellar. MSBs are often skeptical of the benefits of blockchain technology. They see additional risks, like potential compliance and bank account issues, with little understanding of how to implement Stellar blockchain-powered payments into their existing business.

Based on our 20 years of experience in payments and banking and our actual implementation of Stellar at Tempo, an EU-regulated payment institution, we directly address MSBs' concerns with a risk-reduced and structured Stellar onboarding process which includes 3 easy steps.

Step 1: Leverage USDC as a payment mechanism for MSBs. Paying into their existing remittance system and using a non-custodial payment gateway with a one-click integration solution makes this option fast and easy to implement with little risk. In particular, using USDC as a payment mechanism solves many real-world problems for MSBs.

For example, chargebacks are growing at 20% per annum. BP’s solution has immediate value as it allows MSBs to reduce charge-back rates and fraud, as USDC payments are irreversible. Funds are immediately available, thereby assisting MSBs' working capital utilization and improving their treasury efficiencies. In contrast, card payments are credited by the processor up to 15 days following the transaction. Lower cost: USDC payment mechanism is cheaper than cards that average between 1.8 to 3.5% plus additional charge-back and fraud fees may be applicable. Our one-click integration into major money transfer systems already has thousands of clients. BP has negotiated this contract with 2 major MSB IT vendors. New customers: ability to tap into different types of customers than the MSB may typically service. One-click integration into Circle for the MSB to instantly receive digital funds. Supports USDT from Ethereum via Apay and Bitcoin Lightning path payments (that convert to USDC). BP's product roadmap with the additional SCF funding includes integrating directly into thousands of backend systems via Zoiper such as Xero, Quickbooks. Complete Circle API integration. Integrate into Temenos, opening 1,600 banks and credit unions to the Stellar blockchain. Elliptic integration.

https://pay.bpventures.us is charged on a pay-as-you-go model to MSBs already on some key remittance systems that BP has already fully integrated with. The individual MSB pays only once they have hit the volume threshold of 10,000 USDC in volume, to encourage use. BP’s commission revenue is split with the IT platform providers, giving new revenue streams for these backend vendors.

Step 2: Our Anchor in a box solution allows MSBs to connect to Stellar as a payment rail for easy cash-in and cash-out of USDC via SEP 31/6/24 as well as directly sell USDC. This new product provides new revenues and new customers to MSBs. Currently, Polaris is accessible by the Admin Panel, but it's confusing and hard for most MSBs to understand and get started. We have a customized version that allows for a junior operator to manage transactions. It also has an integrated sftp/ftp module that can send batch jobs of transactions including KYC to any website or system backend. With SCF funds, we can complete the full integration into 3 major backend providers as well as one-click integration with several KYC providers for wallet integration.

Step 3: Expanded Stellar Blockchain use through BP’s White label, customized DeFi dashboard solution. The DeFi dashboard solution enables MSBs and their customers instant access to the DeFi ecosystem to trade, swap, invest in DeFi, or cash in/out all from one easy-to-use app. Expanded Stellar blockchain use thanks to BP’s DeFi dashboard solution with open API connectivity for fast, easy integration into Money Service Businesses software platforms.

The DeFi dashboard provides an easy way for those who want to protect their funds from inflation to put their funds into USDC. We think of it as a simplified Uniswap with deposit and withdrawal functionality. It supports all major DeFi wallets such as Albedo, Freighter, xBull, Rabet, and Ledger. It has a seamless onboarding process for new users to crypto. It supports mobile users via Albedo and xBull. It shows the market price via Coingecko API (may be moved to an oracle). It shows the positive or negative gain vs Coingecko (Impact). It protects users from trading too much from the Coingecko price via slippage protection. Integration into Google Analytics to help MSBs track customer usage.

The DeFi dashboard is built on Stellar blockchain technology with advanced algorithms that enable users to obtain better pricing when they swap instead of a simple path payment. Our product roadmap includes: It is build-ready to support Stellar Smart contracts when they launch later this year. Additional Liquidity Pool Staking options. Reports on incorrectly priced assets (trading opportunities). Virtual Visa Card issuance.

Pluto Loans B2B,SCF #10,Pluto Loans,Pluto Loans B2B,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/reccHsP7ESotRVcIv,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$48480.00,$48480.00,455896.00,7/12/2022,Legacy v3.0 Award,Self-repaying loans: Spend your future yield today,"Pluto Loans allows users to spend their future yield today. With Pluto Loans, users can deposit yield-producing collateral and get a loan of their future yield immediately. No liquidation risks. The loan debt is time-based and self-repaying. While the long-term objective for Pluto Loans is to be global, the initial rollout will be focused in Argentina, with plans to quickly expand to the rest of LATAM.

The Problem: A quick summary

Argentina has an inflation rate of over 50%. The Argentinian peso has devalued 2,609% since 2012. Argentina has a ban on purchasing foreign currency, but not on cryptocurrencies. Fixed-term deposits in USD have a yearly interest rate of 0.75% - 2%. Users of platforms such as Mercadopago who deposit ARS benefit from a ~32.3% annual interest rate, which is worse than the aforementioned ~50% inflation rate. Personal loans in Argentinian pesos have an interest rate of >76% (and most have early cancellation or repayment fees).

The Opportunity

Pluto is LATAM-focused, with most of its core team members being based in Argentina, and with Argentina being its main country of operation. Cryptocurrency is legal in Argentina. Users can make use of regional anchors to buy ARS issued on the Stellar network or use exchanges to buy XLM. Users deposit yUSDC and get a loan of 50% of their collateral loaned out in pUSD. pUSD is a token backed by the future yield generated by yUSDC, intended to trade 1:1 with yUSDC through various pegging mechanisms. Self-repaying; a loan gets paid by the yield generated by the collateral of yUSDC (and other reward mechanisms), at the maturity of the loan, a user gets back their collateral and keeps their loan. Get more than yUSDC’s APY due to our “Shared Yield” mechanism where Pluto Loans vault shares “unclaimed” APY with all borrowers. No risk of liquidation. No early cancellation fees. Build on top of other Stellar projects (Ultrastellar’s yUSDC), strengthening the ecosystem.

While the concept of self-repaying loans exists in other chains such as Alchemix, the fees charged by the ETH network make it prohibitive for the average Argentinian to make use of. Thanks to Stellar’s low network fees and broad network of Anchors, we are able to bring financial inclusion to the personal loans space to every Argentinian.

The Problem: In depth

To fully understand the potential of Pluto Loans, it is important to take a look at the unique economic situation of Argentina. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina. Argentina has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. On an annual basis, consumer prices soared 55.1 percent, the fastest annual rise since June of 2019, quickening from a 52.3 percent surge and beating market forecasts of 53.8 percent. This inflation chart comes hand in hand with the depreciation of the Argentinian Peso, a currency that has suffered a massive devaluation in the past few years, going from requiring ARS 4.42 to buy USD 1 in May 2012, to requiring 115.32 to buy 1 USD as of April 2022. The unique positioning of Pluto Loans in the Argentinian market could not be completely explained without also mentioning the ban on purchasing foreign currency that was reinstated in Argentina on September 1st, 2019, which has created a parallel market that is often used as a reference for the “true price” of the USD, currently with a ~100% gap with the official exchange rate. This has made Argentinians seek to hold their savings in crypto stablecoins, especially USD-pegged ones, which can be legally bought and traded in the country.

The Solution: Pluto Loans

The core concept presented by Pluto Loans is simple: A user takes out a loan by locking away yUSDC which is a yield-generating asset, with an estimated yield of 9% at the time of writing and 50% of the locked amount is loaned out in the form of pUSD (therefore, pUSD is backed by the future yield of yUSDC). After the yield produced by the collateral has covered the loan amount, a user can get back their initial investment and keep their loaned amount. In order to illustrate the basic operation behind Pluto Loans, let’s consider a user who wants to take out a loan. They would deposit 100 yUSDC into Pluto Loans’ platform which would be securely locked away and start generating a daily interest thanks to yUSDC’s mechanics, and immediately get 50 pUSDC disbursed to their account. This happens atomically in one single transaction. The user is free to spend those 50 pUSD how they see fit, perhaps exchanging it to other stellar assets such as BTC or ETH because they believe the price might go up. After ~4.5 years, the original 100 yUSDC has generated 50 yUSDC in interest @ 9% APY; At this point, the owner of the loan can simply withdraw the original 100 yUSDC and keep the 50 pUSD, which are now backed by 50 yUSDC still locked in Pluto Loans’ account. Note: Pluto Loans generates revenue by keeping 10% of the APY generated from loans, which is omitted from the calculations and diagrams to keep things simple. In the above scenario, the 100 yUSDC would take ~4.87 years to generate 55 yUSDC to pay for the 50 pUSD loaned out and the 5 yUSDC service fee to Pluto Loans.

Extra repayments, pegging mechanism and rewards

The Pluto Loans system allows users to pay back their loan debt at any time, with no repayment or cancellation penalty. Consider the case of our user who took out a 50 pUSD loan and locked away 100 yUSDC. If they were to regret their decision and pay back the debt immediately (50 pUSD not considering Pluto Loans’ service fee), they would pay back the 50 pUSD which would in turn be burnt (as they are no longer backed by future yield of yUSDC) and the 100 yUSDC would be sent back to the user. An important aspect of the burn mechanism is that Pluto Loans accepts pUSD always at a 1:1 rate, regardless of market price, this incentivizes borrowers to buy more pUSD when the price is low, helping to maintain a 1:1 ratio. Let’s see an example. A user deposits 100 yUSDC and gets a 50 pUSD loan. The market rate is 1:1 with yUSDC. The user buys ETH with those 50 pUSD (now they have 100 yUSDC locked and 50 USD worth of ETH). The price of pUSD drops, and is now 0.9 instead of 1:1. The owner of a loan can now purchase 50 pUSD at 0.9 yUSDC each (spending 45 yUSDC), and repay his loan with the 50 pUSD, since Pluto Loans always accepts pUSD at a 1:1 rate regardless of market price. Our user now has the 100 yUSDC back, 50 USD worth of ETH and because they bought pUSD, this drove the price up, helping to maintain a 1:1 balance. Pluto Loans considers yUSDC, USDC and USDT as valid USD assets, and any of them can be used to repay a loan at a 1:1 rate, regardless of market price, and they may choose to use any of these assets to make repayments or cancel a loan, which has an interesting consequence for the Pluto Loans ecosystem. When a user makes an early repayment in pUSD, these are burnt since they are no longer backed by the underlying asset. However, when repayments are made in USDC, yUSDC or USDT, there is no need to burn these assets since their value has a different pegging mechanism. When this happens, these funds are exchanged to yUSDC and since they don’t belong to any loan, they start creating “Shared Yield”, which is distributed proportionally based on the weight of each loan, which effectively means that the yield of Pluto Loans is always higher than the yield of yUSDC alone. Because the yield is higher than simply keeping yUSDC, some users may choose to keep their funds locked in Pluto Loans vault even if their loan has already been paid out in order to keep generating interest. This is also possible and encouraged, as a small 0.5% fee is charged and added to the “Shared Yield”. Other pegging mechanisms include rewarding those users who provide liquidity to pUSD and other valid USD pegged assets. Finally, recalling the original scenario when a loan has reached its maturity and it has been self-repaid, “... the owner of the loan can simply withdraw the original 100 yUSDC and keep the 50 pUSD, which are now backed by 50 yUSDC still locked in Pluto Loans’ account.” Those 50 yUSDC are also now generating “Shared Yield”, further helping to auto-pay down loans faster.

Technical considerations

While Stellar has created Turrets, a clever smart contract protocol for Stellar, they have lost momentum due to the recent announcement of native Smart Contracts; Pluto has decided not to pursue an implementation using Turrets but rather build its software in a way where the server-based approach can be replaced by smart contracts once they become available. Two models are being considered at the moment, one which is purely CEFI (Pluto must be trusted as an entity), and another one which is semi-CEFI (trust is still required, but it guarantees that the funds will not be spent by Pluto). The technical design for the full-CEFI solution is as follows: From a storage perspective, Pluto Loans does not use a centralized database and instead relies on account balances stored on-chain. This design puts the system in a good place to be migrated to smart contracts later on. When a user takes out a loan, they send the money to a Pluto Loans account, and in exchange they receive tokens that represent their loan status; the reason for this approach is that any data we ask the user to store on their account can be erased by them later on, so it cannot be relied upon. We can’t store it in our own account since Stellar accounts have a 1000 subentries limit. By using the AUTHORIZE flag on the assets sent to the user we can guarantee the assets are immovable and the user cannot transfer, delete or otherwise alter their loan data. A common authorization pattern looks as follows: Operation 1: Issuer uses SetTrustLineFlags to fully authorize account A, asset pUSDDEBT. Operation 2: Payment of pUSDDEBT from Pluto Loans to A. Operation 3: Issuer uses SetTrustLineFlags to set account A, asset pUSDDEBT to AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG state (effectively freezing the asset). The list of immovable assets we use are: pUSDDLP, which represents the loaned amount. pUSDSHARE, which represents the locked collateral (while right now it’s 2:1 ratio in the future this could be configurable which is when having separate assets is necessary). pUSSDEBT, which is used to calculate the portion of the yield generated into the Pluto Loans Vault account that each user is entitled to. When the loan has been repaid in full, either because of an early repayment or because the loan has been self-repaid, the borrower can ask Pluto Loans to get back their collateral which will then unfreeze the Pluto Loan assets and burn them, and give the user back their collateral. The technical design for the semi-CEFI solution is similar to the above, but with the following twist: Instead of one central vault, each loan will have its own vault (account) of which Pluto and the user will carry 50% each of the required weight to perform any operation. This guarantees that Pluto cannot move the funds without the users’ consent, and also that the user cannot withdraw the collateral without Pluto’s consent. Due to Ultrastellar’s innovative model, yUSDC is paid daily into this vault; the loan gets repaid over time automatically. It is innovative because generally in dApps the interaction is initiated by users (e.g. “Claim reward”). This approach has the benefit of clear accounting, but it requires managing multiple vaults which has some drawbacks: A user’s vault contains yUSDC which are 50% in the users’ control and 50% in Pluto’s control. Even after the loan is repaid, the funds cannot be moved unless the user wants to. Harder to migrate to smart contracts (locked funds would not be entirely in Plutos’ control). Pluto also pays out extra yUSDC from its shared yield vault. In the CEFI model, this is a mathematical formula that calculates how much extra yield the user has accrued, in this second approach, the shared yield would have to be paid into each vault, following Ultrastellar’s model, which increases risk of failure and is more computationally expensive. Pluto has so far implemented the fully-CEFI approach but will be seeking community feedback regarding the semi-CEFI approach.

The next time you buy a t-shirt, you can tip the garment workers who made it. 100% of your tip is sent directly to the workers’ individual bank or mobile money accounts be it in Pakistan, Vietnam, or Kenya. Like this, consumers can directly impact the lives of the people who made their products. In only 30 min, brands can implement our tipping solution as a widget in their online shops. By using tip me, brands improve their customer loyalty, retention rates, and long-term revenue.

tip me creates a win-win-win situation for all stakeholders involved: On average, workers receive an additional income equivalent to a 13th monthly income. For the first time, they receive feedback from the end-customers who value their work. This changes not only their income but also their self-esteem. Consumers can give back directly and effectively, knowing that 100% of donations go where they should. They learn about the origin of a product. Companies can position themselves as responsible brands. Because of the unique emotional experience, consumers connect stronger with the brand and the products. This directly translates into higher revenue as the retention rates, shopping cart values, and referrals increase because of tip me.

In 2019, we launched our first pilots. From day one, our solution proved to be very attractive and successful both to consumers and our partner brands. The most important parts of the system have now been automated: we can onboard and administer thousands of workers effectively. Installing our solution into new online shops is fast and convenient. The bottleneck for us to reach millions of workers worldwide is the traditional banking sector. The high transfer fees, the administration overhead, and low transparency of the old system are big main pain points.

As Stellar has specialized in cross-border money transfer, it is the most attractive blockchain network available for our use case. The possibilities of the Stellar network, especially with its instant payments at an extremely low cost and high transparency, would be a breakthrough for the scalability of our mission. The automation of payments will decrease our administration overhead significantly.

Stellar will reduce the transaction cost of tip me by 90%. In our business model, brands pay these transfer fees. Especially for corporate brands with over 100,000 workers, these transaction costs from tip me amount to millions of USD per year. Stellar reduces them to a minimum. This new pricing made possible by Stellar will make the tip me product an absolute no-brainer for large brands looking for impact and marketing.

By reducing our administration overhead, tip me can reach 2x more workers with the same team size. Thanks to the inherent transparency of blockchain transactions, we can create a donation/tipping experience where consumers, workers, and brands can trace their impact in real-time. They can see proof that 100% of their tips have been sent to the wallets in question, instead of blindly trusting our organization.

The SCF grant will enable us to move the global tipping solution onto the Stellar network. Thanks to the blockchain capabilities, we can create truly borderless donations directly to individuals, safe and transparent. This investment creates another powerful real-world Stellar use case. It shows how Stellar enables new business models and donation solutions that would not be possible in the old banking system. It shows the potential of microtransactions and borderless payments by creating direct social impact for garment workers around the globe. It enables tip me to scale our impact to millions of workers.",,,https://tip-me.org,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NMk65_UvM,,,,,,,Helen Deacon,,,,,

The GetPaid team is an experienced team well known with Stellar and its technology, as we have operated ClickPesa for the last 3 years. In addition, we also know the African digital economy well. Bridging those two worlds is a perfect fit. Stellar’s open, low-fee network is what creators, traders, and freelancers in Africa need. However, just giving them the technology is not enough; a simple user interface on top of Stellar is what this group needs. GetPaid is the result.

Earlier this year, GetPaid started slowly validating assumptions through low-tech solutions. We technologize where needed, as technology is not always the answer, and try different ideas catered towards our community of creators, traders, and freelancers. This has resulted in a marketplace app open for African creators, traders, and freelancers whereby they can connect with global gig-providers and earn money. The marketplace app is utilizing Stellar’s ecosystem and technology where possible. Each registered user (creator and gig-provider) gets a Stellar account to store their received tokens in.

Although we started with a community group and an app to store tokens in, the GetPaid product is far from finished. We just started, whereby utilization of the Stellar account functionality is step 1. Considering many exciting developments are happening on the Stellar network, there have been identified many interesting use cases such as NFTs on the Stellar network (low fees compared to Opensea on Ethereum, affordable for Africa, our community already loves the idea), yield earning, escrow, and many others. The first step is accomplished and our community is guiding us on what they further need. We do this with a Stellar-first approach, utilizing its technology and ecosystem as much as possible.

In order to operate with the Stellar network, a user must: Create a stellar account, buy XLM, and either install a browser extension or use their private key directly on the website where they wish to spend their assets. With many people still hampered by tech-illiteracy (or specifically crypto-illiteracy), the concept of installing a browser extension can be daunting: “Go into BrowserExtension website and create another account which will hold the keys for the Stellar account you just created, then install this browser extension and enter the details of your BrowserExtension account. You will use this browser extension to sign for transactions on other websites”, most users would find this user experience to be too convoluted. It is complex workflows like these that, in part, deter users from getting started in their Stellar journey.

However, “Enter your password to complete this operation” is very well understood by any user who has ever done any financial transaction online (including mainstream online banking). The only way to implement this workflow today is to use the private key directly on the website that generates the transaction, but users can’t be certain of what the website will actually do with their private key.

People are familiar with passwords; they have been around for a very long time, and anyone with internet access has had to use their password to authenticate at some point. Stellar Secret Keys are passwords in themselves (with the caveat that they cannot be changed). The cognitive load is greatly reduced if people simply enter their private key into a website, but at the same time exposes them to a security problem. What if the website is malicious? It could then use their private keys to perform unwanted transactions.

The Simple Signer is a simple, yet secure approach that tackles this problem. Hosted in a trusted website, the Simple Signer comes in the form of an HTML widget that takes a transaction and offers the user to sign it inside the widget using their private key. The Widget will then return the signed transaction to the requesting website, never exposing the user’s private key. The Simple Signer HTML Widget will be open-source to ensure transparency and auditability.

The Simple Signer Widget is a great entry point for crypto newbies to get started with the Stellar network; for the tech-savvy, it is no suitable replacement for browser extensions. Browser extensions are still extremely convenient as they allow multi-account handling and other advanced functions which are outside of the scope of this project (such as providing liquidity directly from the extension, as is the case with Albedo). Today there are many wallets for Stellar; Albedo, Freighter, Rabet, etc., and developers have to integrate their projects with each one of them in order to provide the best range. The Simple Signer will initially allow users to sign with their private key, but just as easily, it can allow users to connect their favourite wallet directly from the widget, and abstract the complexity of integrating with each individual wallet for Stellar developers, thus helping the community market their products faster.

The technical implementation that makes the Simple Signer is rather trivial. In its simplest form, by using an <iframe> that serves the Widget in a bespoke domain, the parent website cannot access its content or modify it as the communication happens from child to parent, meaning the Simple Signer Widget can communicate with the parent, but not vice-versa. The HTML Widget would take an XDR as a GET parameter, exactly like Stellar Laboratory and would present a user-friendly explanation of the operations that are happening inside that transaction. Finally, it will ask users to sign it and once done, invoke the window.parent.__handleSignedTransaction method and pass in the signed transaction as a parameter. In this way, the private key is never leaving the Widget’s site.",,,https://github.com/fsodano/simple-stellar-signer,,https://youtu.be/7wbBuwEHQYo,,,,,,,Fabricio Leonardo Sodano Pascazi,,,,,

Defying predictions, the World Bank reports that global remittance flows have proved to be resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020, officially recorded remittance flows to low-and-middle-income countries reached $540 billion, only 1.6 percent below the $548 billion seen in 2019.

With an increased desire for migrants to support their families back home and the economic conditions in host countries proving favourable (e.g. stimulus packages), paired with shifts in flows from informal to formal channels (from hand-carry cash to digital remittances), the flow of global remittances to low-and-middle-income countries is expected to reach $565 billion by 2022.

CHALLENGES

The tiny archipelago nations in the South Pacific are often overlooked or deprioritized when it comes to expediting tangible, achievable solutions to real-world and sometimes life-threatening problems.

As we enter an age of rapid acceleration and transformation, Fijians and Pacific Islanders who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of adverse macro and micro economic conditions are left behind.

The people of the Pacific rely heavily on remittances and there has been very little improvement from service providers, to help reduce the cost of transactions and to meet UN SDGs.

THE SOLUTION

Built on the Stellar network, we would like to develop a new pathway for remittances into the South Pacific. A pathway that removes the need for traditional intermediaries and one that gives frictionless access to global financial systems to those who are often forgotten. We call it FijiCoin (working title).

FijiCoin will be a FIAT-collateralized stablecoin, pegged against the Fijian Dollar.

We will play the role of asset issuer, anchor and wallet to help facilitate transactions, manage reserves and the necessary compliance in each relevant jurisdiction. We will also play a leading role in introducing on/off-ramps into Fiji and the South Pacific.

We are in discussions with the Reserve Bank of Fiji (Central Bank) and have made a submission to their FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. They will be a key stakeholder in allowing us to tokenize the Fijian FIAT and help guide us with regulatory and compliance requirements for FX controls, monetary policy, transparency and security.

By removing the traditional barriers of sending and receiving remittances to loved ones, our aim is to help fight poverty through enhanced financial inclusion and to improve the lives and livelihoods of Fijians and South Pacific Islanders.",,,https://www.mai.money/,,https://vimeo.com/594633494,,,,,,,"Rush, Rush ",,,,,
Ebioro,SCF #8,OrunPay,Ebioro,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recsWgGMe0r36Gza0,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$236763.00,$239164.32,863783.29,9/30/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,Financial Freedom for all Cubans,"OrunPay’s mission to provide financial freedom to all Cubans was borne out of frustration over their lack of autonomy to make financial decisions. Financial independence is particularly relevant today, where a choked Cuban economy, made worse by government mismanagement, stringent US sanctions and a serious decline in tourism brought on by the Covid 19 pandemic, is driving the need for fresh funds to reach the hands of the Cuban people. This is pushing Cubans to find innovative solutions to send and receive payments, as well as to manage their personal finances.

Cubans’ lack of financial autonomy is the result of several factors, including an undeveloped financial infrastructure (i.e. payment services, investment options, borrowing capabilities, etc.), a strong internal focus on Cuban government-led businesses and financial institutions, and US sanctions which stifle the Cuban economy’s access to external markets. The US Embargo has blocked all US companies from working with Cuba, but this has also had a serious chilling effect on non-US entities as well. While non-US companies are allowed to work in Cuba, many do not out of fear of direct or indirect US reprimand. For example, the vast majority of European banks refuse to deal in any way with Cuban transactions, even when fully compliant with all rules, as a result of heavy fines imposed on several European banks because of their Cuban dealings. Consequently, many fully owned European companies, that are by law authorized to conduct business with Cuba, cannot make payments to their Cuban counterparties because their European banks will not authorize the transactions. The same happens for payment flows exiting Cuba because the receiving banks will not accept the payments. Ironically, this chilling effect has also harshly affected the Cuban private sector despite the intention of the US sanctions legislation to encourage its growth. Instead, most Cuban merchants and small businesses cannot accept credit card payments for products/services they wish to sell online or at a point of sale because credit card processing companies will not onboard Cuban customers.

The strong internal focus by the Cuban government on its government-led businesses also means that the foreign capital that does manage to enter Cuba through foreign investment is usually managed by other entities linked to the Cuban government, rather than by the foreign investors bringing the money in. Similarly, Cuban companies who have operations outside of Cuba face the same issue when entering foreign capital into Cuba. For both these types of companies, access to their funds is essentially given to them based on a hierarchical structure decided by Cuban government-affiliated entities. Even remittances, the largest source of income and a lifeline for many Cuban individuals, is first received by Cuban authorities before being distributed to individuals in local currency.

Throughout the years, Cubans have developed a deep mistrust towards their and government institutions and national currency, due to government mismanagement and currency devaluation as a result of many periods of economic uncertainty. Cuba is currently experiencing a drastic devaluation because of difficulties faced by the Cuban government in unifying the Cuban Peso (the official currency) with an alternative currency that has been circulating in parallel since 1994.

All of these issues have largely isolated Cuba from the world overtime, severely affecting its economic development and the financial options of its population. What remains is a chaotic, expensive and highly inefficient way of dealing with day-to-day finances for everyday Cubans and businesses. There is therefore a great need to provide a comprehensive solution that equips Cubans with the financial independence that they need.

OrunPay is developing a payment platform that places autonomy back into the hands of Cuban nationals and companies. Our solution is outside of any government control and allows Cuban individuals and companies to send and receive payments in a variety of different currencies. Additionally, Cuban nationals will have a lower level of exposure to currency devaluations because it will be possible for them to store their money in foreign-denominated stablecoins, outside the control of Cuban government financial institutions. This will all be done in a compliant manner and is what we hope to be the first step in the broader digitalization of the Cuban economy.",,,https://ebioro.com/,,https://vimeo.com/594326811,,,,,,,Yulexi Matienzo,,,,,

Tellus Cooperative,SCF #8,Tellus Cooperative,Tellus Cooperative,Education & Community,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recNO4RNaF9ack4Kq,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$29500.00,$29500.00,107624.95,9/29/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,Be cooperative.,"Tellus Cooperative will create an Application Programming Interface (API) that connects Merchant Services Provider (MSP) to Anchor Asset Issuers using Turing Complete Signing Servers (TSS). Doing this, we will be able to reach out to a massive amount of users already participating in the gig economy either as customers, merchants, or workers. We believe that MSPs have tremendous untapped potential. By taking advantage of their existing credit flow logic and incorporating Stellar Smart Contracts at the heart of their payment gateways, we can create a seamless transition to Decentralized Finance Protocols. MSPs' merchants, customers, and workers will be the most benefited from this adoption wave. The API will facilitate the creation of Stellar accounts by deploying stored smart contracts on a TSS Network run by individual MSPs' merchants. This will ensure trustless transactions within a closed ecosystem.

We will implement a tip pool protocol leveraged by anchored assets. This will generate liquidity to strengthen national stablecoins and incentivize adoption through crypto savings and rewards. Tellus will release a utility token to the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX), aiming to serve as a bridge between anchored assets, lumens, Stellar tokens, and the cryptocurrency market itself. This Token will serve as a medium to measure our protocol performance and as a store of value to reward the protocol's participants.

We want to work directly with anchors to incorporate local currencies into everyday transactions. Our API will connect app services and anchor providers to take full advantage of bank-backed assets. This way, merchants will be able to ""stake"" a percentage of their earnings into local anchored tokens. A process similar to when an app service charges you an internal fee. This layer of service will utilize Turing Complete Signing Turrets (TSS) which will store, deploy, and sign Stellar Smart Contracts (SCC) to the blockchain. These funds will ultimately be sent to a tip pool and shared equitably. This works similarly to a mutual fund, only contributing participants will have access to these pools. For example: If 3 restaurants working with an app delivery service send money to a pool, they and only they will have access to these assets. Stellar Multi-Signature operations are the perfect way to achieve this, the functionality to provide different weights to different account holders is advantageous when transacting in shared accounts. Their tip pools will have certain sizes. These will be geometrically proportional to the Merchant Services Provider (MSP) accumulated earnings and will be calculated within the same TSS network and updated in the blockchain periodically. These size limits will create an organization system within tip pools. When a pool gets filled up - or reaches its limit, no new participants will be allowed in it, and a brand new pool will be created to accommodate the new participants in the protocol. The pool members will have full ownership control over the assets, they will be able to transact with other members of the pool, and be rewarded with Tellus Tokens by cooperating and maintaining the protocol's integrity.

Parameters will be automatically designed by averaging MSP's performance. We will conduct local market research to gather information about their profitability, sales, and competition. We will use this data to create a series of forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Time Series, Autoregression) and compare it to Tellus Ecosystem's expected growth rates. This way, we will be able to fine-tune weights to achieve the best profitability margins that will ultimately determine the size and behavior of the merchant tip pools. At the same time, we will use the Tellus Token to reward and incentivize account holders using MSP's apps. Instead of driving demand using reward systems like coupons, cashback, or sales, we will simply “gift” Tellus Tokens to end users and workers alike. This model improves upon existing cashback and customer retention strategies. We give the rewardee an opportunity to use our tokens on the same MSP environment, with API affiliates, or simply exchange them for other assets in the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX). The amount to be awarded will vary depending on the role of the user in the ecosystem. As mentioned before, merchants will be rewarded by leveraging their anchored assets in Tellus's Tip Pools. MSP's Customers will be rewarded depending on their activity - purchase habits (cashback), social interactions, or airdrops. MSP's Workers will be rewarded by profitability margins within the tip pools, this way, the same workers that help maintain the integrity of the service, will be rewarded by its growth, adding a layer of participatory democracy to our protocol.

The reason behind this economic model is to enable everyday people to be a part of something great. As individuals, we have the collective power to change the world. Cooperation will be what changes it.

While entertaining the implications of an economic model like Tellus', we developed a food delivery app to incorporate our system. Vajom Delivery is an application designed to evaluate, test, and improve the foundations for Tellus Cooperative. Its main goal is to foment restaurants and gig workers alike by using Tellus's Protocol. As a team, we realized that a great deal of small businesses lacked the market size to attract Merchant Services Providers. Villarrica, Chile, a tourist town in the heart of the south, has more than 70 food establishments with no delivery service available. One of the observed factors for MSPs' behavior is the seasonality of the market, and therefore a greater risk. As we kept researching Villarrica's market conditions, we were able to draw unprecedented parallels to other towns in Chile. The incorporation of a service like Vajom in Villarrica would create new jobs and more business for locals. Yet, a food delivery app like every other will face the same problems that major MSPs consider when expanding their business. Hence, we decided to create the app and use it as a testing environment for Tellus' Cooperative.

The platform consists of 4 applications built using AngularJS and the Ionic Framework: Vajom Delivery - for customers, Vajom Local - for merchants, Vajom Repartidor - for delivery drivers, Vajom Admin - for overseeing the application's performance.

We want to make Vajom open source. We believe that having a testing platform to implement our advances with Tellus is a great way to connect with the Stellar Community. At the same time, this will allow us to review possible pitfalls within the protocol and get input on improving its functionality. We envision Vajom in the future as a fully automatic system with no central ownership, where all merchants and delivery drivers are the owners themselves of the platform. We are certain that as we improve Tellus' relationships and codebase, Vajom will be able to shine and grow on its own.",,,https://telluscoop.com,,https://vimeo.com/594342417,,,,,,,Bastian Alexander Koh Cuende,,Tellus Cooperative,@telluscoop,https://discord.gg/ysuxyKJ34c,
