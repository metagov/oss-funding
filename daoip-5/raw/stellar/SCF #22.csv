Additionally, developers would be able to deploy their Soroban smart contracts on Futurenet & Production networks using the same UI. It would vastly simplify the deployment & management of Stellar network elements & Soroban contracts. The users will have the option of deploying network elements in SaaS mode (managed by IntellectEU) on popular cloud providers as well as on-premise. Users would be able to deploy & manage their custom applications (front-end & back-end) using the UI. The Catalyst - Stellar application would represent Kubernetes Native class of applications. It will be specifically designed to run on Kubernetes platforms, using and extending the functionalities of the Kubernetes API and components to facilitate Stellar infrastructure management. Catalyst's existing CI/CD processes would be reused and extended to support the deployments.

The EcoXChange Application would be based on the Stellar blockchain and allow enterprises to manage their carbon emissions, carbon offsets, and carbon credits. The enterprise would have regulated tokens/assets issued on Stellar that could be traded within the enterprise as well as on the secondary market. The application would allow the creation of accounts on the Stellar network, establish trustlines, issue & distribute tokens/assets, maintain carbon emissions for manufacturing outcomes, and allow the trading of tokens/assets. The issuance, trade (via buy/sell offers), and other features will be built and executed via custom Soroban contracts that the enterprise can upload using the Catalyst UI. In addition, the enterprise will deploy one or more Stellar nodes to increase network health and decentralization, as well as Horizon API server instances for reliability. The application's front end and back end will be deployed using Catalyst as well.",,,https://www.catalyst.intellecteu.com,,https://youtu.be/pMpZbbcxwcA,,,,,,,"Jonathan Mayeur, Oleksandr Yamkoviy",,https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=%2Fshowcase%2F73072309,,,
