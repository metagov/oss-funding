Over the past three years, our strategic alignment with Celo has showcased the blockchain's potential and driven adoption and application across diverse projects and communities. Our work has helped Celo attract more innovative projects and community engagement, driving further growth and establishing a solid foundation for future developments within the blockchain and ReFi sectors. Some highlights include:\n\n- **Impact Tracking and Hypercerts**: We have launched a pilot for impact tracking using hypercerts minted on Celo. We developed a detailed minting guide and supported 15 nodes in creating their first hypercerts, with plans to initiate a retroactive funding round to reward high-impact projects. This initiative highlights how ReFi DAO utilizes Celo\u2019s blockchain capabilities to enhance transparency and accountability in tracking regenerative impacts.\n- **Celo Integration and Operations**: ReFi DAO has integrated Celo into our operations across all nodes, including the creation of over 23 Celo SAFEs for financial management, hypercerts for impact reporting, and Celo NFT collections. We support the development of further tools on Celo, such as working with Karma GAP to deploy their platform on Celo and onboard our community. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to utilizing and supporting the Celo ecosystem, driving innovation, and fostering community engagement within the regenerative finance space.\n- **Prosperity Passport**: One of our key current projects is the development of the Prosperity Passport, for which ReFi DAO is the lead product designer and partner. This smart account on Celo features a dynamic dashboard highlighting an individual\u2019s contributions within the ecosystem. Built on Superchain Accounts by Kolektivo Labs, the Prosperity Passport aims to showcase participation, impact, and community representation, further establishing Celo as the leading vehicle for real-world impact.",

Celo\u2019s mission of financial inclusion and sustainability aligns perfectly with our goals of regenerative entrepreneurship and community empowerment in Los Altos Mirandinos. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ve been utilizing and plan to further align with the Celo ecosystem:\n\nCurrent Utilization of the Celo Ecosystem\nOnboarding and Education through Celo\u2019s Platform:\n\nWe've been using Celo\u2019s blockchain as the foundational layer for our onboarding events and educational initiatives. During events like the \u201cRuta del Caf\u00e9,\u201d we introduce local farmers and entrepreneurs to Celo's blockchain technology, demonstrating how it can be used for sustainable practices and financial inclusion.\n\nBy leveraging Celo\u2019s user-friendly mobile-first approach, we've made it easier for community members to understand and adopt blockchain technology, which is crucial for areas with limited access to traditional financial services.\n\nDevelopment of Governance Structures with Celo\u2019s Tools:\n\nWe are in the process of creating a governance token using Celo's blockchain to facilitate decentralized decision-making within our community. This token will empower community members, giving them a stake in the project\u2019s future and encouraging active participation in governance.\n\nThis aligns with Celo\u2019s ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), where financial tools are built to be inclusive and accessible to everyone, particularly underserved populations.\n\nCollaboration and Networking:\n\nWe have been utilizing Celo\u2019s network to establish connections with global partners and experts. By aligning with the Regen Coordi-Nation initiative, which is closely connected to the Celo ecosystem, we are able to tap into a broader community of like-minded projects, enhancing our impact and reach.\n\nRoadmap for Future Alignment with Celo\nIntegrating DeFi Solutions:\n\nWe plan to explore and integrate Celo\u2019s DeFi solutions to provide microloans and financial services to local farmers and entrepreneurs. \n\nThese microloans, facilitated by Celo\u2019s stablecoins (cUSD and cEUR), will provide much-needed financial liquidity to support regenerative practices and sustainable business models.\n\nBy utilizing Celo\u2019s stablecoins, we ensure that these financial services are accessible, stable, and reliable, even in an environment like Venezuela, which is often plagued by hyperinflation and economic instability.\n\nScaling Educational Programs with Celo\u2019s Ecosystem:\n\nWe aim to scale our educational programs by developing a series of workshops and online courses on regenerative finance (ReFi) and blockchain technology, powered by Celo. These programs will be made accessible not only to local communities but also to a broader audience in Latin America.\n\nOur goal is to create a replicable model that can be adopted by other communities interested in leveraging Celo\u2019s ecosystem for sustainable development.\n\nExpansion of Governance Token Use:\n\nMoving forward, we plan to expand the use of our governance token, built on Celo, to include broader community participation. \n\nThis will involve creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that empowers farmers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders in Los Altos Mirandinos to propose and vote on key initiatives.\n\nThe governance token will also be used to reward community contributions, further incentivizing sustainable practices and participation in the ReFi Venezuela Node.\n\nStrengthening Global Connections:\n\nThrough ongoing participation in Celo\u2019s global initiatives, we plan to deepen our connections with international partners, thereby attracting more resources, expertise, and visibility to our projects in Venezuela.\n\nThis alignment will not only enhance our local impact but will also contribute to Celo\u2019s vision of building a global financial system that creates conditions for prosperity for all.",

This collection is emblematic of how our collective vision can transcend traditional boundaries, merging art, technology, and environmental stewardship. Each NFT not only represents a unique piece of art but also serves as a digital beacon for ReFi Tulum, with proceeds supporting our ongoing projects and community initiatives.\nThis initiative is a powerful way for ReFi Tulum to support female artists, providing them with a platform to showcase their talents and achieve financial returns from their art. With 70% of sales going to each artist and 30% going to ReFi Tulum, we feel this is beautiful and regenerative way to support both the arts as well as our local ReFi Initiatives, directly benefiting Tulum's environment and community.\nWe are thankful to the Celo team for their dedication to ReFi,  the arts and for supporting female artists. We are excited for this incredible milestone, and opportunity to use the power of creativity to drive meaningful change and foster a regenerative future for Tulum and beyond.\n![Fierce Feminine of RefiBannersm](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJhTmZeqA.jpg)\n\n\nWe also used some of the funds to start the modification work on our TF100 but unfortunately have run into issues with our worker going MIA after starting the work. We are looking to find a replacement but in the meantime have also been helping and partially funding the move of demo Petgas plant to Tulum which will allow us to show the technology in action and accelerate our plastic sequestration efforts.\n",

Focus Group style meetups plus User education\nNarrow down 3 products that will be developed during the BootCamp sessions.\n\nGives us ready users of the products when they are ready.\nProvides a quicker roadmap to deployment and user acquisitions.\nProvides available Testers and Users\n\n3. Phase 2 Cipher Sessions and Boot Camp\nPhysical and Virtual training and DevRel sessions.\n\n4. Monthly \u201cCELO Stars\u201d Meetups\nMonthly Developer Podcasts sessions\n\n\n5. Marketing materials and campaigns\nWe deploy referral-based strategies like how exchanges have listing bounties. If developers are referred to take our program and go through with it, the referrals earn rewards.\n\nWe\u2019d run community marketing activities, thread contests and more.",

The incubator program. The Celo Africa DAO has established an incubator program to nurture and support early-stage projects built on the Celo blockchain. This program provides entrepreneurs and developers with the necessary resources, mentorship, and funding opportunities to transform their innovative ideas into fully functional dApps. The incubator focuses on projects that align with Celo's mission of financial inclusion and sustainability, helping to expand the ecosystem by fostering the next generation of impactful blockchain solutions in Africa. These projects are further recommended to Celo Camp for further scaling and development. Some of our cohort graduates have launched on Minipay.\n\n2. Developer Talent. To drive innovation and growth within the Celo ecosystem, the Celo Africa DAO places a strong emphasis on attracting, developing, and retaining top developer talent. The DAO organizes monthly code jams (technical workshops), mini-hackathons, and workshops aimed at equipping developers with the skills needed to build dApps on the Celo platform. By creating a robust pipeline of skilled developers, the DAO ensures that the Celo ecosystem has the technical expertise necessary to scale and evolve, particularly in the African context where local solutions are most impactful. Additionally, these monthly code jams have been supporting BWC(build with Celo) hackathons to get the most out of them, and the results and metrics have been impressive. Most of the promising projects are forwarded to the incubator program and Celo Camp\n\n3.  Community Awareness & Brand Visibility. Celo Africa DAO actively works to raise awareness of the Celo brand and its mission across Africa. To amplify Celo's presence, the DAO has partnered with and sponsored major Web3 events across the continent. These high-profile events provide a platform to showcase Celo\u2019s innovative solutions to a wider audience, including developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts. By being visible on these big stages, Celo Africa DAO not only increases adoption of the Celo platform but also positions Celo as a key player in the African Web3 landscape. This strategy strengthens the ecosystem's reputation and fosters a deeper connection with the community, driving engagement and advocacy for Celo's mission of financial inclusion and social impact.\n\nOur roadmap for the Q3 & Q4 2024 will include:\n1.  Expanding Community Engagement i.e. Community Events & Meetups, University Partnerships, and Sponsorship of Major Web3 Conferences:\n2. Strengthening Developer Talent & Ecosystem Growth i.e. Hackathons & Innovation Challenges\n3.  Incubating and Scaling Impactful Projects i.e. Incubator Cohorts and Ecosystem Collaboration.\n",

We deployed resources such as the\u00a0[Celo EU website](https://www.celodao.eu/),\u00a0which attracted 5000+ visits, created a\u00a0[Celo Ecosystem Report,](https://docsend.com/view/yrb3tzt9kepfc38r)\u00a0and published 10+ hours of high-quality videos, including a mini-documentary. CELO EU co-hosted 14 events with 2,000+ attendees, represented Celo, and spoke at 25+ events. Through our 3 co-programs (RefiDAO, Take Off & Casa Celo) - we engaged 100+ builders. Besides this, we\u2019ve also kickstarted the Celo Governance Development Sprint. Our efficient management of Season 0\u2019s budget enabled us to return 27% surplus funds of 120,000 CELO to the community fund. \n\nIn Season 1 (February \u201824 - June '24), We\u2019ve doubled down on the successful elements of Season 0. We launched a community-led conference to shape the future of Celo by bringing together 150 key stakeholders in Berlin. Alongside this, we've supported more than 5+ European meetups hosted 2 meetups attracting 150+ attendees. We are planning further collaboration at ETHCC \u201824 by dedicating a track for Public Goods and highlighting projects that contribute to the ecosystem. In addition to this, we\u2019ve represented Celo during ETHGlobal, DAS, ETHDam, and about 15+ side events while creating content for this experience. We\u2019ve also developed 2 scripts for a mini-documentary, which are being produced. We\u2019ve also assisted Casa Celo Madrid in hosting 2 events with around 70+ participants. To focus on growing our BD efforts, we\u2019ve connected with around 25+ investors and are enhancing our database to 100+ high-quality entries. Lastly, we\u2019ve contributed to creating a startup database for CeloPG containing 150+ \noperational startups.\n\nIn season 2 (July 2024 - December 2024), Celo EU will accelerate Celo\u2019s growth through Events and Community Development, Ecosystem Support, and Content Production and Storytelling. We will organize an online Celo Gather event, sponsor four local European events, and support Celo Africa DAO and KohCelo at ETH Safari and DevCon. We'll host three online workshops on MiCA, CEL2, and the Superchain ecosystem. Our ecosystem support includes creating three educational resources, expanding our investor database by 20 entries, and exploring institutional collaborations. Content production will feature two new Builder\u2019s Story episodes on Minipay, a mini-series at EthSafari, a documentary at DevCon, and after-movies highlighting Celo's role at these events to record eight videos throughout H2. We aim to drive growth, solidify partnerships, and support the community\u2019s vision.",

I witnessed firsthand how Celo's stablecoins and accessible platform empowered coffee farming communities, fostering financial inclusion and sustainable development.\n\nCasa CELO Q1 2024 Initiatives: As a co-creator of these initiatives, I was instrumental in promoting Celo adoption and community building. These efforts strengthened the Celo ecosystem in Madrid, Barcelona, and beyond.\n\nReFi Madrid & Celo Team Engagement:  My involvement in the inaugural ReFi Madrid initiative and my consistent engagement with the Celo team demonstrate my dedication to the Celo ecosystem's growth and its focus on regenerative finance.\n\nSocialFi Polis Challenge & Celo Alignment\n\nCelo Polis is deeply intertwined with the Celo ecosystem:\n\nCelo Blockchain Integration: The entire game is built on the Celo blockchain, leveraging its speed, low fees, and mobile-first accessibility. This ensures that even users with limited resources can participate and benefit from the platform.\nCelo: Celo tokens and stablecoins (cUSD) are integrated into the game's economy, serving as the primary currency for transactions, rewards, and investments. This promotes the adoption and real-world use of Celo's native stablecoins.\nCommunity-Driven Initiatives: CeloPolis encourages participants to propose and implement projects that address real needs within the Celo ecosystem. This fosters innovation and empowers community members to actively contribute to Celo's growth.\nEducational Focus: The gamified learning platform educates users about Celo's unique features, such as its focus on mobile accessibility, sustainability, and social impact. This helps to raise awareness and understanding of Celo's potential.\n\nRoadmap for Future Utilization & Collaboration:\n\nCelo Developer Tools Integration: Explore deeper integration with Celo's developer tools and resources to facilitate the creation and deployment of Celo-based applications within the CeloPolis ecosystem, thanks to Celo Camp orientation.\nCollaboration with Celo Projects & DAOs: Forge partnerships with existing Celo projects and DAOs to create synergies, cross-promote initiatives, and expand the platform's reach and impact, like Refi DAO Barcelona or hachathon participation.\nReal-World Impact Initiatives: Leverage CeloPolis as a platform to educate and engage users in real-world social impact projects built on the Celo blockchain.\nContinuous Community Building: Actively participate in the Celo community, contribute to discussions, and support other projects within the ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, my past experiences and our future plans demonstrate a strong commitment to the Celo ecosystem. CeloPolis is designed to be a catalyst for growth, education, and community building within the Celo community. By providing an engaging and accessible platform for learning and experimentation, we aim to empower individuals and communities to leverage Celo's technology to create a more inclusive and sustainable future.",

We are developing and adapting a template for the regenerative community marketplace.\n\nSo far, we have onboarded several stakeholders, such as greenhouses, farmers, artists, and more, and we are mapping a network state of impact in Mexico. This will eventually become a full-fledged marketplace (e-commerce) for regenerative products and services. We are building and experimenting with concepts, actions, connecting channels, and regenerative literature to create a comprehensive platform for the community.\n\n**Utilizing the Celo Ecosystem:**\n\n- **NFT Minter and Marketplace:** Our evolving NFT minter and marketplace will be built on the Celo platform, leveraging its blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and scalability.\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00001.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nrCbkcHk/Re-Fi-minter-00001.png)](https://postimg.cc/Fk5BFvkd)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00002.png](https://i.postimg.cc/50PWLFMy/Re-Fi-minter-00002.png)](https://postimg.cc/xJbZS88V)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00003.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HWhCL52P/Re-Fi-minter-00003.png)](https://postimg.cc/gr87Sx1v)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00004.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gjQ9BFjP/Re-Fi-minter-00004.png)](https://postimg.cc/Lgt0nWjy)\n\n- **Tokenomics and Framework Design:** By contributing to the state of the art in tokenomics and framework design, we aim to set new standards for regenerative finance within the Celo ecosystem.\n  - Read more here (don't forget to mint): [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/refimexico.eth)\n  - Check out our [White Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTUaVFSvcLJ_LIiKt6X9Z7BQ7SIKJbzDLdpSoh6vdtc/edit)\n  - Explore our [Github](https://github.com/ReFiMexico/NFT-Minter)\n  - Karma: [Gap Karma](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-mexico---building-a-regenerative-community-nft-impact-minter)\n  - Don't forget to visit our [Web page](https://refimexico.org/en)\n\n- **Stakeholder Onboarding:** We have successfully onboarded various stakeholders, including greenhouses, farmers, and artists, to our community, and they are ready to dive into the Celo ecosystem, facilitating their transition to blockchain-based solutions.
