The user simply connects their wallet and the portal will scan their asset holdings for assets with DAO enabled. Each DAO comes with its own dashboard and explorer. Users could see all the proposals and vote for or against any active proposals, they will be able to comment on the proposals and see which accounts have voted. The explorer will show the voting history for an account and its voting power.\n\nDecentralized On-Chain Voting\nFor immutability and transparency, all votes will be recorded on the Stellar blockchain. The process can be audited by any third party to check the integrity of the results. On the backend, InstantDAO will take snapshots of the Stellar ledger to track the voting power of the participants.\n\nCommunity Builder (future)\nInstantDAO will allow projects to build up their community of active governance participants with social and discussion features.\n\nToken Rewards (future)\nInstantDAO will allow projects to issue claimable balances to reward DAO participation."

              "productsAndServices": "INTRODUCTION\n\n“As COVID-19 still devastates families around the world, remittances continue to provide a critical lifeline for the poor and vulnerable.” - Michal Rutkowski, Global Director of the Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice at the World Bank.\n\nDefying predictions, the World Bank reports that global remittance flows have proved to be resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020, officially recorded remittance flows to low-and-middle-income countries reached $540 billion, only 1.6 percent below the $548 billion seen in 2019.\n\nWith an increased desire for migrants to support their families back home and the economic conditions in host countries proving favourable (e.g. stimulus packages), paired with shifts in flows from informal to formal channels (from hand-carry cash to digital remittances), the flow of global remittances to low-and-middle-income countries is expected to reach $565 billion by 2022.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nThe tiny archipelago nations in the South Pacific are often overlooked or deprioritized when it comes to expediting tangible, achievable solutions to real-world and sometimes life-threatening problems.\n\nAs we enter an age of rapid acceleration and transformation, Fijians and Pacific Islanders who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of adverse macro and micro economic conditions are left behind.\n\nThe people of the Pacific rely heavily on remittances and there has been very little improvement from service providers, to help reduce the cost of transactions and to meet UN SDGs.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nBuilt on the Stellar network, we would like to develop a new pathway for remittances into the South Pacific. A pathway that removes the need for traditional intermediaries and one that gives frictionless access to global financial systems to those who are often forgotten. We call it FijiCoin (working title).\n\nFijiCoin will be a FIAT-collateralized stablecoin, pegged against the Fijian Dollar.\n\nWe will play the role of asset issuer, anchor and wallet to help facilitate transactions, manage reserves and the necessary compliance in each relevant jurisdiction. We will also play a leading role in introducing on/off-ramps into Fiji and the South Pacific.\n\nWe are in discussions with the Reserve Bank of Fiji (Central Bank) and have made a submission to their FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. They will be a key stakeholder in allowing us to tokenize the Fijian FIAT and help guide us with regulatory and compliance requirements for FX controls, monetary policy, transparency and security.\n\nBy removing the traditional barriers of sending and receiving remittances to loved ones, our aim is to help fight poverty through enhanced financial inclusion and to improve the lives and livelihoods of Fijians and South Pacific Islanders."

              "productsAndServices": "Tellus Cooperative will create an Application Programming Interface (API) that connects Merchant Services Provider (MSP) to Anchor Asset Issuers using Turing Complete Signing Servers (TSS). Doing this, we will be able to reach out to a massive amount of users already participating in the gig economy either as customers, merchants, or workers. We believe that MSPs have tremendous untapped potential. By taking advantage of their existing credit flow logic and incorporating Stellar Smart Contracts at the heart of their payment gateways, we can create a seamless transition to Decentralized Finance Protocols. MSPs' merchants, customers, and workers will be the most benefited from this adoption wave. The API will facilitate the creation of Stellar accounts by deploying stored smart contracts on a TSS Network run by individual MSPs' merchants. This will ensure trustless transactions within a closed ecosystem.\n\nWe will implement a tip pool protocol leveraged by anchored assets. This will generate liquidity to strengthen national stablecoins and incentivize adoption through crypto savings and rewards. Tellus will release a utility token to the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX), aiming to serve as a bridge between anchored assets, lumens, Stellar tokens, and the cryptocurrency market itself. This Token will serve as a medium to measure our protocol performance and as a store of value to reward the protocol's participants.\n\nWe want to work directly with anchors to incorporate local currencies into everyday transactions. Our API will connect app services and anchor providers to take full advantage of bank-backed assets. This way, merchants will be able to \"stake\" a percentage of their earnings into local anchored tokens. A process similar to when an app service charges you an internal fee. This layer of service will utilize Turing Complete Signing Turrets (TSS) which will store, deploy, and sign Stellar Smart Contracts (SCC) to the blockchain. These funds will ultimately be sent to a tip pool and shared equitably. This works similarly to a mutual fund, only contributing participants will have access to these pools. For example: If 3 restaurants working with an app delivery service send money to a pool, they and only they will have access to these assets. Stellar Multi-Signature operations are the perfect way to achieve this, the functionality to provide different weights to different account holders is advantageous when transacting in shared accounts. Their tip pools will have certain sizes. These will be geometrically proportional to the Merchant Services Provider (MSP) accumulated earnings and will be calculated within the same TSS network and updated in the blockchain periodically. These size limits will create an organization system within tip pools. When a pool gets filled up - or reaches its limit, no new participants will be allowed in it, and a brand new pool will be created to accommodate the new participants in the protocol. The pool members will have full ownership control over the assets, they will be able to transact with other members of the pool, and be rewarded with Tellus Tokens by cooperating and maintaining the protocol's integrity.\n\nParameters will be automatically designed by averaging MSP's performance. We will conduct local market research to gather information about their profitability, sales, and competition. We will use this data to create a series of forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Time Series, Autoregression) and compare it to Tellus Ecosystem's expected growth rates. This way, we will be able to fine-tune weights to achieve the best profitability margins that will ultimately determine the size and behavior of the merchant tip pools. At the same time, we will use the Tellus Token to reward and incentivize account holders using MSP's apps. Instead of driving demand using reward systems like coupons, cashback, or sales, we will simply “gift” Tellus Tokens to end users and workers alike. This model improves upon existing cashback and customer retention strategies. We give the rewardee an opportunity to use our tokens on the same MSP environment, with API affiliates, or simply exchange them for other assets in the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX). The amount to be awarded will vary depending on the role of the user in the ecosystem. As mentioned before, merchants will be rewarded by leveraging their anchored assets in Tellus's Tip Pools. MSP's Customers will be rewarded depending on their activity - purchase habits (cashback), social interactions, or airdrops. MSP's Workers will be rewarded by profitability margins within the tip pools, this way, the same workers that help maintain the integrity of the service, will be rewarded by its growth, adding a layer of participatory democracy to our protocol.\n\nThe reason behind this economic model is to enable everyday people to be a part of something great. As individuals, we have the collective power to change the world. Cooperation will be what changes it.\n\nWhile entertaining the implications of an economic model like Tellus', we developed a food delivery app to incorporate our system. Vajom Delivery is an application designed to evaluate, test, and improve the foundations for Tellus Cooperative. Its main goal is to foment restaurants and gig workers alike by using Tellus's Protocol. As a team, we realized that a great deal of small businesses lacked the market size to attract Merchant Services Providers. Villarrica, Chile, a tourist town in the heart of the south, has more than 70 food establishments with no delivery service available. One of the observed factors for MSPs' behavior is the seasonality of the market, and therefore a greater risk. As we kept researching Villarrica's market conditions, we were able to draw unprecedented parallels to other towns in Chile. The incorporation of a service like Vajom in Villarrica would create new jobs and more business for locals. Yet, a food delivery app like every other will face the same problems that major MSPs consider when expanding their business. Hence, we decided to create the app and use it as a testing environment for Tellus' Cooperative.\n\nThe platform consists of 4 applications built using AngularJS and the Ionic Framework: Vajom Delivery - for customers, Vajom Local - for merchants, Vajom Repartidor - for delivery drivers, Vajom Admin - for overseeing the application's performance.\n\nWe want to make Vajom open source. We believe that having a testing platform to implement our advances with Tellus is a great way to connect with the Stellar Community. At the same time, this will allow us to review possible pitfalls within the protocol and get input on improving its functionality. We envision Vajom in the future as a fully automatic system with no central ownership, where all merchants and delivery drivers are the owners themselves of the platform. We are certain that as we improve Tellus' relationships and codebase, Vajom will be able to shine and grow on its own."
