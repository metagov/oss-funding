Through this system, communities collect and verify ecological data about their environments using remote sensing and blockchain technology. This verified data becomes a valuable digital asset that can be sold to organizations needing environmental data, such as researchers, companies, and governments. By creating direct financial incentives for conservation activities, CDI provides communities with an economic alternative to destructive land use practices while strengthening their capacity for ecological monitoring. The system ensures transparent and verifiable conservation outcomes while aligning economic incentives with environmental protection goals. The first small-scale pilot was co-financed in 2022 by Celo Foundation (a 5K USD grant) and collected more than 5000 data points in the Philippines.See tweet for deployment on Celo: https://x.com/dwddao/status/1821108787752710239 or gainforest.app to explore the data and past transactions."
