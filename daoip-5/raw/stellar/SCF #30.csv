Coindisco,SCF #30,Galaxy Ramp - fiat onramp to any token on Stellar,Coindisco,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec7yuazvycNZIcvj,Awarded,100.0,Pre-Launch #3 - Mainnet,$96000.00,$96000.00,330151.27,6/27/2025,Build,Galaxy Ramp offers an onramp for any token on the Stellar network to help users simplify the purchase of Stellar tokens with fiat using Soroban. Existing solutions do not allow direct purchase with a card or bank account on Stellar any tokens except XLM or USDC.,"Existing on-ramp providers currently only support XLM and USDC as the only Stellar tokens users can purchase through their services. 
Galaxy Ramp is a new on-ramp solution that allows users to purchase any Stellar token by combining familiar fiat on-ramp experience with the power of Soroban smart contacts. 
This solution will leverage an on-ramp API integration of one of Coindisco's trusted partners. 
We will build a website, back-end infrastructure and Soroban smart contacts logic for this solution.
The website will allow users to connect their Stellar wallet and initiate purchases of popular Stellar tokens.
In order to purchase a Stellar token, a user will first need to purchase Stellar USDC through our on-ramp partner. Stellar USDC will be used as a “value transfer asset” in this flow. 
When a user initiates a transaction, we will determine the best USDC rate for the asset and display that on the interface along with any fees. 
When a user commits to the transaction, a new proxy Stellar wallet will be created by a Soroban smart contract. That wallet will be associated to user-owned Stellar wallet via our back-end. 
That proxy wallet will be controlled by our back-end and Soroban smart contacts. An asset trustline will be automatically established on the proxy wallet.
The purchased USDC in the transaction will first arrive to the proxy wallet. From there, we will leverage custom back-end service and multiple Soroban smart contracts to find the best asset-to-USDC rate, convert USDC to the asset a user request in the flow, and send the obtained asset balance to user's wallet address.  
We will also create a widget that will allow other products on the network to integrate this product directly and securely.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTdBr2zLeHGrxvXEymB6L2w5LqHBASBUZiw_rJTpI5M,"Based on our market research, we expect Galaxy Ramp to be a popular solution among both Stellar users and product creators. We also expect demand from asset issuers on the network who will look for user-friendly solutions for selling their tokens. Our prospected targets for the first launch year:
- 20,000+ unique customers 
- $500,000+ worth turnover
- 30+ unique Stellar assets purchased by users. 

After the initial launch, we will be offering Galaxy Ramp integration to popular wallets and products on the network. The target is to have the Galaxy Ramp widget solution integrated into 5 unique products on the Stellar network.",https://coindisco.com/,https://github.com/coindisco,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1je8N-mDUdGI5-b_Lmz1to9434H-9mTU8,Yes,"We will launch and promote the Galaxy Ramp web application on social networks and at various fintech conferences. As we integrate with more onramp providers, we'll carry out cross-promotion activities to attract more users. The functionality will also be embedded into the existing Coindisco web and mobile apps. We will also do our best to integrate the Galaxy Widget or SDK into the most popular Stellar products.","Since its launch in Q1 2024, Coindisco has demonstrated stable growth in userbase and revenue, achieving over $100,000 in turnover within the first couple of months since launch. 
With Coindisco, we have established live integrations with leading on- and off-ramp providers such as Moonpay, Revolut, and Stripe, enabling thousands of users worldwide to seamlessly buy crypto. 
Working with multiple on ramp providers, researching customer behavior and the state of the crypto landscape allowed us to develop unique features like 'True fee' and 'Insights' that make Coindisco a stand-out product among other solutions on the market according to user surveys.  
We will leverage that experience when creating the Galaxy Ramp, which will further enhance our offerings and provide a new unique service for the Stellar network that meets the needs of the growing ecosystem.","Deliverable 1:

Rarible’s standard contractual model includes 4 elements:
Rarible has worked with many different chains, teams and foundations,
and can provide a flexible contracting strategy to support our client’s
needs.

For Stellar, we propose a phased approach to acceptance and payment
as follows:

Phase 1: Integration
Licensing and configuration for Stellar NFT minting and trading on
Rarible.com.

Proposed Phase 2
*Note: A Secondary agreement will be required to initiate Phase 2
Phase 2: Marketing
Licensing and configuration of Rarible NFT infrastructure to
support new chain
Annual support and maintenance subscription for deployed
software
Mint pack licensing for per mint platform fees
Coordination services for marketplace success - community and
creator onboarding.

Description: Deploying Rarible NFT infrastructure on Stellar so that
Rarible.com and other parties can mint and trade NFTs on Stellar
via $XLM.

Completion criteria: Demonstration of NFT minting and trading
workflow on Stellar explorer using Rarible delivered contracts and
systems.

Delivery timeframe: Generally 90 days for non-EVM chain.
Creator enablement on Stellar marketplace via Rarible.com.

Phase 3: Incentives
Incentivized Minting for NFT community creation and growth
Rarible believes the best way to “cold-start” a vibrant NFT ecosystem is
through the incentivization of both creators and early adopters. There
are two mechanisms for incentivizing early adopters to pursue the
minting mechanics and make it a habit. Those are by offering free mints,
and by selectively delivering airdrops to the most active minting and
trading wallets. Rarible manages campaigns related to the former, while
we can provide a playbook to our customers on incentivizing airdrops,
while Rarible itself does not conduct these.
Description: Following the acceptance of Phase 1 deliverables,
Rarible will coordinate the strategy and delivery of the first 90 days
of Stellar creator minting. This 90 day plan will feature over 100
artists, creators and projects, and will be designed to drive
awareness and adoption of Stellar NFTs within the Stellar
community, as well as into the broader Rarible.com ecosystem.
Highlights include:

Drop schedule managed by Rarible for the first 3 months with
ongoing marketing support.
Note that Rarible will manage incentivization of creators as
needed to successfully deliver this program. Incentives are
included in Phase cost.
Acceptance criteria: Stellar representative reviews Artist /
collector line up for Rarible.com take over, and approves creator
targets for 90 day campaign.
Payment terms: Due upon Phase 2 kickoff (following Phase 1
acceptance
Delivery timeframe: Rarible.com takeover week within 60 days of
Phase 2 kickoff. Project runs for 90 days following the initial
takeover launch.
Description: Following the acceptance of Phase 2 deliverables, the
Stellar marketplace on Rarible.com will be ready to offer mints.
Historically, Rarible charges a $2 / mint platform fee for each mint
conducted on Rarible.com and on Rarible X marketplaces. This fee
covers the scalable costs of infrastructure as mints increase. For a
Minting Incentivization campaign, Rarible reduces the platform
cost to $0/mint for a specified number of mints, removing the cost
of minting as a barrier to participation. Rarible instead sells a “mint
Note, that following the initial Mint Pack based incentivization phase,
Rarible generally recommends that the customer “turn on” a $2 / mint
platform fee, where that fee is used to offset mint pack costs, and to
fund an ongoing creator enablement fund, thereby making the ongoing
operation of the marketplace self sustaining.
Note, while Rarible does not operate chain specific airdrop incentives,
we would recommend allocating ~ $200,000 of airdrops for the first 90
days.

Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance and Support Annual cost to manage ongoing support of Stellar Marketplace on

pack” to the customer with a specified number of mints at a
discounted price.
For the initial 90 days of no-cost minting, Rarible recommends
a 500,000 mint pack at the cost of $200,000. This dramatically
reduces the cost per mint to $.40.
Acceptance criteria: This mint pack is accepted upon completion
and acceptance of Phase 2 deliverables.
Payment terms: Due upon Phase 3 kickoff (following Phase 2
acceptance)

Description: Rarible provides a support team dedicated to the
ongoing success of your marketplace, creators and users. We

Relevant improvements include:-

1. Integration of Stellar Payment Rails
   Stellar’s payment rails will facilitate real-time cross-border and local payments, enabling CHATS to seamlessly support multi-currency disbursements. Stellar's infrastructure will ensure transactions happen securely and efficiently, minimising volatility and currency conversion issues.

2. Migration of Reserve Assets to Stellar USDC
  Migrating CHATS’ digital assets  reserve assets to Stellar USDC will help stabilise value during aid disbursements, enabling more transparent tracking of funds. This would  allow for the quick redemption of funds by vendors and aid recipients. 

3. Offline Payment Integration (USSD/SMS)
  Using  Stellar’s payment infrastructure, we will improve CHATS’ offline payment functionalities via USSD and SMS, ensuring transactions are recorded securely and uploaded once beneficiaries access the internet, resulting in secure settlement even in remote areas without internet access.

4. Cash for Work Feature Upgrade
   Stellar's transparency and tokenization will improve CHATS conditional cash transfers for Cash-for-Work programs. Stellar’s advanced smart contract functionality will improve  real-time validation and disbursement of funds, ensuring that only eligible recipients receive aid. 

 Impact on CHATS
- Stellar's infrastructure will enable CHATS to handle more transactions at lesser costs and improve its cross-border aid distribution efficiency.
- The integration of Stellar UDSC will improve the speed and security of aid disbursements.
- Offline capabilities and multi-currency support will ensure that CHATS reaches more beneficiaries, especially in remote, underserved areas.

The pilot grant will develop a sustainability and scalability strategy by linking its CVA delivery mechanisms to new interventions under the USAID Nafoore Activity – Nafoore (“added value” in the Fulani language) is a $17m USAID-funded violent extremism prevention program, rooted in positive youth development. The project is led by Mercy Corps Mauritania.
 
By leveraging blockchain, the pilot will create a more inclusive financial ecosystem that empowers youth to access the seed capital needed to start small businesses and social projects. CHATS can first build trust across institutional stakeholders of the program by ensuring that funds are tracked and used for their intended purpose. CHATS automates the release of funds based on predefined conditions, such as the completion and approval of a business plan, project milestones, business performance metrics; or in the case of an  apprenticeship scheme: timesheets. This ensures funds are used as intended, fostering accountability among young entrepreneurs. Additionally, if the program requires a procurement process, CHATS ensures that preferred vendors are being used by program participants, by managing the transactions between vendors and recipients.

Arculus x Stellar: Payments With Soroban,SCF #30,Real World Payments with Stablecoins and Tokens on Stellar with Soroban,Arculus x Stellar: Payments With Soroban,Infrastructure & Services,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recGwkWWrGuZAuC3b,Awarded,67.0,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$148400.00,$98933.34,274970.92,,Build,"Arculus enables stablecoin or token holders on Stellar to pay at any Visa/MasterCard merchant, directly from self-custody wallets, utilizing Soroban smart-contracts.","PRODUCT

Utilizing Soroban, Arculus will write the smart contract that will allow holders of stablecoins (and potentially other tokens) on Stellar to use those funds at any merchant worldwide that accepts Visa or MasterCard. This solution allows for payments directly from a self-custody wallet with the consumer not giving up ownership until the moment of spend.

PROBLEM

Cold storage, while highly secure for storage of crypto assets, are often not ideal for a transactional experience. Arculus has already solved this issue with our next-gen hardware wallet that combines the security of cold storage with the usability of a hot wallet.

Currently, the practical utility of using cryptocurrencies in daily commerce, where speed and convenience are paramount, leaves much to be desired. 

Most merchants do not accept direct payment in tokens or stablecoins; most merchants still want fiat currency. At the very few merchants that do accept digital asset payments, it is a slow process of QR codes, deep-linking, or double checking addresses. In short, it is a slower, more difficult process for both consumers and merchants.

Arculus is making it possible to bridge the gap between consumers with digital assets and traditional merchants by extending the unique transactional features of our cold-storage ecosystem - using Soroban smart contracts to connect self-custodied assets to traditional card payment rails. Arculus with Stellar makes it simple and efficient to pay from cold storage with Stellar tokens. That means meeting the current most popular methodology (VISA/MC Card Tap-To-Pay at POS terminals) where its at.

SOLUTION

Arculus is no stranger to the world of traditional payments. Arculus is created by Composecure, which for the past 20 years has been the world's leading manufacturer of metal payment cards.

Utilizing Stellar's new smart contract platform, Soroban, we will write smart contracts that allow fiat payments from self-custody & cold storage utilizing USDC on Stellar. This functionality will be demonstrated through simulated payment transactions with USDC on testnet and mainnet, as a real world payment scenario would require a licensed transmittance of payment to the merchant acquirer via Visanet. This paves the way for many different entities to adopt the smart contract and use in their own localities, for their own models, with their own remitters (Scaleable B2B Soroban Crypto to Fiat functionality with Stellar Anchor integration).

In practice, the smart contract logic would be loaded onto the chip on a card that's also loaded with a Visa or Mastercard applet. A user would tap to pay at any point of sale terminal, and it would act just as a normal fiat tap-to-pay transaction would, except the balance would be deducted from their cold-storage wallet.

**Although USD is the dominant backing currency for stablecoins today, this same solution can work as non USD stablecoins on stellar for this solution.**

WHAT PROBLEMS DOES THIS SOLVE?

This has the potential to solve many issues in a variety of use-cases. Most notably, and obviously, this greatly increases the real world use case of crypto assets - in this case, Stellar. Allowing people to spend their crypto assets in a way that is familiar and as easy as what they already do every day.

Stellar-Aid Example: Distribute Stellar-Aid branded cards that have this smart contract logic loaded - and can receive aid disbursements. Users of this card will be able to immediately utilize the aid, and eliminate Steps 3 and 4 of the Stellar-Aid Workflow, allowing for faster and more simple access to much-needed aid.

Overall, this project solves the problem of current clunky and slow processes of paying for goods or services with crypto assets, and brings the usability to the current premium accepted methodology.",https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1GI27C-G8A2JkL-lsbr8smC3ufmsygxUghMH_cRu82iM/edit?usp=sharing,"Make USDC on Stellar as transactional for consumers around the world as fiat. 
Through B2B Partners, global consumers will start using stablecoins or tokens on the Stellar blockchain for day-to-day real world payments, and continue to store value onto the Stellar Blockchain as a hedge against inflation.",https://www.getarculus.com,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyDhCaCBMjPvo8EzhMEXSFy4WtGPRk0MI4Z7Ae8Ipgg/edit?usp=sharing,https://vimeo.com/1010382415?share=copy,Yes,"Our go-to-market strategy is to bring on B2B partners that are already active in the crypto-space or in card payments, and bring them the efficiency and speed of payments on Stellar. Arculus is already working with Moneygram as an on and off ramp for USDC on Stellar. 
Additionally, we see the potential for a remittance card product that allows consumers to more easily access their USDC on Stellar. We also see a very valuable use with Stellar Aid-Assist, where Aid recipients could directly send or spend Aid funds anywhere that accepts Visa or Mastercard. This use case would reduce the need for Aid-Assist recipients to obtain local fiat.

The above link showcases the current smart contract operating on polygon that we have loaded onto VISA/MC payment cards and successfully uses USDC on Polygon contained in the Arculus wallet to purchase goods and settle in local currency. 

This functionality is displayed in the Pitch Video Link.","1. [Develop Soroban Collateral #1 - Controller]

 				2. [Develop Soroban Collateral #2 - Collateral]
						a. Developed in tandem with the Controller contract. There will be an instance of the collateral contract for each user. The user ""owns"" the collateral contract but cannot perform operations on it directly. The collateral contract holds a balance of crypto assets. It also tracks a spent amount for each asset, which limits the amount the user can withdraw.
 						b. Completion for this milestone is validated by the completion of the first milestone, when the Collateral contract and it's operations are invoked through the Controller contract.

			3. [Develop Operations Architecture]
						a. There are four main operations. These operations are invoked by the UI on the controller contract and must be authorized by the administrator. The controller contract will then invoke the corresponding operation on the collateral contract. The collateral contract will only allow operations initiated by the controller contract. The four operations are described below.

- Spend: Spend some amount of a particular crypto asset. The administrator initiates this operation when the user performs a spend operation in the financial arena, such as a purchase using a card. If there is a sufficient balance in the asset, the collateral contract increments the spent amount for that asset.
- Payment: The administrator initiates this operation when the user makes a payment to pay down the outstanding balance. This reduces the spent amount of the appropriate asset.
- Withdraw: The user requests to withdraw the collateral balance to another crypto account. The user may withdraw the balance of the asset minus the spent amount.
- Liquidate: The bank seizes the collateral assets. The spent amount of the appropriate asset is sent to the bank's treasury account.

 						b. Completion for this milestone is validated by initial testing of the Soroban Collateral, where invoking the controller contract, authorized by the admin, invokes corresponding operations on the collateral contract. This milestone requires testable functionality of the first two milestones.

It removes complexity from crypto routing and navigating on-/offramp steps.,"TransferMole currently consists of 2 parts:

Part 1: Social payment directory - maps social media usernames to financial termination accounts (e.g. crypto address on any supported chain, bank account, debit card)
Part 2: Payment routing network - provides available payment methods based on recipient's termination account

With the SCF Build Award, we would like to expand the payment routing network to Stellar's on- and off-ramp partners. This would provide people more localised payment options when sending and receiving payments with social media usernames. The SCF Build Award helps to launch the following additional features: 

Feature 1: Offramp from embedded wallet
- When users sign up to TransferMole, they currently add a receiving crypto address or create a new wallet (we have integrated Circle's programmable wallets with private key abstraction for Web2 users)
- With the Build Award, users could directly offramp their USDC balance with Stellar's local offramp providers
- Example: Freelancer receives USDC payment to Telegram username and off-ramps to local bank account via Stellar anchor

Feature 2: Pay social username with local payment option
- Today, users can make payments to Telegram, Instagram and other social media usernames. Each username resolves to a payment page with available payment options based on how the recipient can receive funds. Today's payment options are (1) USDC from Ethereum, Base, Avalanche or Polygon and (2) Visa/Mastercard
- With the Build Award, the available payment options could be expanded and include local payment services
- Example: Send USDC payment to Telegram username and on-ramp using a local e-wallet",https://docsend.com/view/pdrenfqpav5v4cmc,"We expect to service 500,000 users by Q1 2025, across Web2 and Web3, who use their Telegram or social username to receive payments for the following use cases:
- Freelancers accepting client payments with the LinkedIn, Google or other social username
- Creators/Influencers engaging their Web2 audience with giveaways/airdrops to their Telegram, Instagram or Tiktok usernames
- Migrant workers, families and friends supporting people overseas with casual transfers to their social username

Ultimately, irrespective of the use case, our mission is to simplify global P2P payments by removing the need to understand crypto or cross-border payments. For us, success is when people start sharing their social usernames for one-off payment acceptance, especially around social commerce.",https://www.transfermole.com,,https://www.loom.com/share/bd69aa76e72f4efea878180cd8283b84?sid=ea25cfc9-6d39-433a-a4c1-3977a57b62c0,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","We just signed a partnership with YesCoin, one of the top rated Telegram games.

Trustful,SCF #30,"Trustful v1 – System Decentralization, Quadradic Funding Reputation Based, Community Incentives and Developer Resources",Trustful,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recnj68U9UZAHjBOi,Awarded,33.0,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$92000.00,$61333.34,385329.74,3/27/2025,Build,"Decentralizing/enhancing Trustful to enable limitless use cases, fostering a solid governance and reputation ecosystem on Stellar.","Next steps
The product is evolving from a MVP to a fully-fledged V1 platform that:
- Utilizes Stellar Badges and Smart Contracts: Transitioning from a database to smart contracts on the Stellar network to enhance security, transparency, and decentralization.
- Empowers User Profiles: Introduces user profiles that allow members to showcase their contributions and reputation within the Stellar ecosystem.
- Enables Reputation-Based Groups/Communities: Allows the creation of reputation groups/communities where members define what is important within their context, leveraging Stellar ecosystem quests.

This V1 phase aims to build on the initial MVP by creating a more sophisticated and impactful reputation system that deeply integrates with the Stellar ecosystem, advancing beyond simple contributions to shape the future of community governance and resource distribution.

Trustful use cases and Stellar ecosystem growth
1. Creating Reputation-Backed Communities The system enables the creation of communities within the Stellar ecosystem that are backed by reputation data. This approach encourages the formation of small, active nodes of communities—whether they consist of developers, event organizers, or builders—based on shared interests and goals. These communities are formed through a series of reputation badges and corresponding scores. The badge system allows communities to define what is important to them through quests, thereby attracting and aggregating like-minded individuals. This leads to the establishment of specialized working groups that are aligned with the community’s values and objectives. By leveraging reputation data, these reputation-backed communities not only strengthen the social fabric of the Stellar ecosystem but also ensure that collaboration and growth are driven by shared commitments and contributions, rather than just token holdings.
2. Reputation as Data for Decision-Making Reputation data can be seamlessly integrated into decision-making processes, such as grant applications, to enhance the fairness and impact of resource allocation. Take, for instance, the user flow within the Stellar Community Fund (SCF). Applicants can link their wallets, along with the wallets of their team members involved in the project. These wallets will reflect the cumulative reputation earned within the Stellar ecosystem.

Check the use case flow here.

Some use cases drive:
- First Stellar Quadradic Funding Reputation Based: In this incredible use case, reputation acts as a multiplier for voting power, allowing users with fewer tokens to amplify their influence based on their contribution to the ecosystem. By engaging in key activities such as participating in community quests, interacting with Stellar dApps, and maintaining an active presence, users accumulate reputation badges that can increase their voting power to a quadradic funding to small projects or events. What if the major Stellar conferences were funded this way from now on?
- Incentivizing more members to register on the SCF dashboard: Encouraging broader participation by getting more community members to sign up and engage with the Stellar Community Fund (SCF).
- Encouraging all team members of applicants to register and complete quests: Promoting the accumulation of reputation within the ecosystem, fostering quality interactions between Stellar and grantees.
- Motivating active members to remain engaged: Offering the opportunity to earn reputation and be considered for roles such as ambassadors, voters, and other key positions, thus keeping them actively involved in the ecosystem.
- Incentivizing interaction with dApps on Stellar: Encouraging engagement from users and builders, and attracting more high-quality protocols to the ecosystem by leveraging an active user base.

In summary:
The system encourages broader participation by motivating more members to participate in Stellar actions, thus increasing engagement with the Stellar Community Fund. 

It promotes a culture where all team members of applicants are encouraged to sign up and complete quests, helping them build their reputation within the ecosystem. This approach fosters meaningful interactions between Stellar and its grantees. 

Active members are incentivized to stay engaged by offering them the chance to earn reputation, making them eligible for important roles such as ambassadors, voters, grantees and other key positions. By driving interaction with dApps on Stellar, the system not only boosts user and builder engagement but also attracts more high-quality protocols to the ecosystem, benefiting from an active and thriving user base.

- Output:
    - Number of Reputation Badges imported, issued, and created
    - Number of communities creating their own reputation frameworks
    - Number of new users funding their wallets and using Trustful to interact with the Stellar ecosystem
    - Increase in transactions related to reputation building and quadratic funding
    - Builders creating and using wallets to receive funds, and the number of projects funded

- Impact:
    - Expanding financial access by enabling a broader range of users to engage with the Stellar ecosystem, especially those who may not have had access to traditional financial services.
    - Democratizing funding by allowing smaller contributions to have a meaningful impact through the quadratic funding mechanism.
    - Strengthening ecosystem participation by incentivizing more users to engage in governance and funding, thus building a more active and reputable community.
    - Empowering builders by providing accessible funding and resources, enabling innovation and further growth within the Stellar ecosystem.

By focusing on both quantitative outputs and qualitative impacts, success would not only be about scaling numbers but also about the meaningful change these activities bring to the ecosystem and broader financial inclusion.",https://trustful-stellar.vercel.app/,https://github.com/blockful-io/trustful-stellar-dapp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXrUs-s8TvM,Yes,"Our go-to-market plan focuses on leveraging a quadratic funding event as a key launch strategy and integration with other dApps on Stellar
This event will serve as the first big real-world application of Trustful's reputation system, driving immediate engagement and showcasing the platform's unique value in decentralized governance and funding.

We plan to:
1. Engage key communities and partners within the Stellar ecosystem to participate in and promote the event, building early traction.
2. Activate growth strategies by incentivizing both participants and voters through reputation-based rewards, ensuring continuous engagement beyond the event.
3. Expand marketing efforts across social media, crypto forums, and partnerships with influential players in the Stellar space, highlighting the event as a milestone for the future of decentralized funding.
4. Showcase case studies and success stories from the event to attract additional communities, users, and developers to adopt and integrate Trustful’s reputation system.
5. Iterate quickly based on feedback from participants and early adopters, making improvements to drive long-term scalability and adoption.

The Funding Formula:
- Matching Pool: A pool of funds is set aside by the Stellar Community Fund (SCF) to match donations from individual contributors. Trustful's reputation system will play a critical role in determining how these funds are allocated, leveraging reputation as a factor to amplify the impact of each contributor's support.
- Donations: Individuals contribute to the projects they support, and those with a higher reputation on Trustful—earned through previous participation in the ecosystem—may have enhanced influence in the donation process. Their reputation can help boost the visibility and impact of their contributions in the quadratic matching process.
- Quadratic Matching: The key to quadratic funding is the matching formula. The matching amount is calculated in a way that prioritizes breadth of support over the size of individual donations. In Trustful's system, reputation will be an additional layer that affects the matching calculation. The more individual contributors a project has, and the higher the reputation of these contributors on Trustful, the larger the matching amount it can receive. This means that even small contributions from highly reputable community members can have a greater impact than larger contributions from users with lower reputation.

Example:
- User A: Contributes $50, has no reputation badges.
- User B: Contributes $30, but has several reputation badges on Trustful, earning them a 5% reputation multiplier.
Even though User B contributed a smaller amount, their reputation boosts their influence, making their contribution count for more in the quadratic funding calculation. This creates a system where reputation and community engagement play a central role, ensuring that projects are supported by a broad base of trusted and active participants.

Obs:
This initiative is aimed at supporting and incentivizing contributors who drive education around Stellar and Trustful. A key growth strategy here is that projects receiving rewards through this QF round will be required to create educational content or projects related to Stellar and Trustful, giving a significant boost to both together.

Additionally, all participants will be using Trustful for this QF, allowing us to launch a real use case of reputation-driven resource allocation, this will generate further growth, as the round will be focused on educational projects about Trustful and Stellar, driving awareness and engagement across the community.

We also plan to:
1. Expand Trustful’s reputation use cases: By integrating real-time SCF data, we'll create new pathways for grantees and funders to engage with reputation-based funding.
2. Drive community adoption: The Stellar quests integration will encourage more users to participate and build reputation, enhancing engagement through SCF-related tasks.
3. Showcase new features: During the launch, we will promote the SCF API integration to highlight how Trustful can enhance transparency and efficiency in grant distribution.
4. Target developers and partners: By offering resources open-source and storybooks, we’ll attract developers and ecosystem partners to build on Stellar and use Trustful, further expanding its capabilities and use cases.


Note that some dApps, such as Tansu and also the Brazilian ambassadors community, are already prepared and taking the first steps to integrate Trustful into their activities. The QF round will take place after we achieve all the milestones, gather user feedback, and implement necessary improvements to ensure the QF round runs smoothly.","We launched an MVP as part of our first application – this is a Legacy project. 
This proposal is aimed at preparing the dApp to generate real traction moving forward. The MVP was recently presented to the community during a call on Discord, which helped us gather valuable feedback and insights on the platform’s usability. The feedback received will inform the next steps and improvements, setting the foundation for broader adoption and user engagement.","MVP is live! 
Feel free to access the dApp and issue your Reputation Early Adopter badge

The MVP was part of the Activation Award, and we have already presented it to the community, which received it positively and provided ideas for use cases (this is the spirit). We will soon have a dApp (Tansu) integrating Trustful for maintainer levels and to aggregate reputation for the participants involved in the dApp. In addition to the use cases we can implement to improve ambassador processes, resource allocation, and events on Stellar, we already have dApps that managed to find use cases.

With this Build Award, we aim to achieve three primary goals:
1. Expand Host Function Support: This award will allow us to expand functionality to include all Soroban host functions, enabling comprehensive testing and verification of any smart contract deployed on Soroban.
2. Improved Interface and Documentation: Enhance the tool’s interface to improve readability of the verification results and provide more meaningful warnings to developers. We will expand the documentation to include detailed installation and usage instructions, as well as demo contracts to experiment on and real-world video examples.
3. Performance Enhancements: We will test the tool on real-world contracts and use it in our audits, use the feedback to improve the tool. Running formal verification proofs can be time-consuming, and this award will allow us to optimize the performance of Komet, reducing the time required to execute these proofs.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jr-r8sHDDVqoxvmBOFlSvL1DFS9cCd88Jmrl7mVrmqY/edit,"Success and impact for Komet would be defined by having auditing firms integrate it into their formal verification process, positioning Komet as the go-to tool for ensuring the security of high TVL protocols on Stellar. 
The output would be Komet becoming a core part of the audit workflow for protocols, leading to widespread adoption by developers and security teams. Ideally, our goal would be to have four full-time formal verification engineers continuously engaged with large protocols as more value is locked on Stellar.
The impact would be significant: by making formal verification the gold standard for Stellar protocols, Komet would reduce the likelihood of security breaches, ultimately protecting user funds and fostering greater confidence in the Stellar ecosystem. This would help drive further adoption of Soroban smart contracts, making Stellar more competitive in the DeFi space and beyond.",https://komet.runtimeverification.com/,https://github.com/runtimeverification/komet,https://youtu.be/L3W_oqwDyRk,Yes,"Our go-to-market strategy for Komet will follow the blueprint we successfully used for Kontrol, our open-source formal verification tool for Solidity. After building Kontrol, we maintained and improved it through paid formal verification engagements. Developers can freely use the tool, but many projects and protocols hire us to assist with writing tests and proofs and to guide them through the verification process.
Additionally, we monetize Kontrol by charging larger protocols for the compute power necessary to run proofs on their extensive codebases, as these often outgrow the developer's local resources.
For Komet, we plan to replicate this strategy. After completing the grant project, we will offer Komet to the Stellar community as an open-source tool for developers to use. Beyond that, we will provide services to help projects write formal verification proofs, execute them, and optimize the tool for their specific needs, ensuring the highest level of security. This will allow us to continue developing Komet while building long-term relationships within the Stellar ecosystem.

","For prior traction and validation, we would like to highlight our success with Kontrol, a tool similar to Komet but built for Solidity instead of Rust and Soroban. Kontrol has been widely adopted by hundreds of developers, including professional auditing firms, solo auditors, and internal testing teams. Notably, major protocols such as Optimism and Lido have incorporated Kontrol into their security flow. This widespread usage validates the core concept of Komet and demonstrates the demand for such a tool in blockchain ecosystems.

As for Komet itself, we have already begun exploring its application during the FxDAO smart contract audit. During this audit (available here),  we discovered 10 informational and 10 potentially critical findings. Of the critical findings, considering the hypothetical creation of tests designed using the invariants raised in the audit, 7 out of the 10 would likely have been discovered using fuzzing, and definitely would have been found using formal verification. While not trivial to be identified during testing, the remaining three could be validated and demonstrated using Komet’s formal verification capabilities. Of the 10 informative findings, three could have been found using either fuzzing or formal verification, and the remaining 7 are related to protocol design or best practices. Not only would Komet help shorten the duration of audits due to the ease of validating invariants, but would also empower developers and engineers to test and protect their own code.

Going forward, we believe that Komet could make all future Soroban audits more efficient, enabling developers and auditors alike to catch critical issues earlier in the development cycle. This validation from both Kontrol’s success and Komet’s real-world applicability shows that Komet is poised to have a substantial impact on the Soroban ecosystem.","Tranche 1 has already been completed using the previous SCF #28 activation award of $50,000.

Tansu - Soroban Versioning,SCF #30,Tansu - Bringing developers communities on-chain,Tansu - Soroban Versioning,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recSDU41kudJLzoXL,Awarded,67.0,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$99360.00,$165600.00,778072.86,7/10/2025,Build,"Bring decentralization back to Version control System with Soroban providing transparency, integrity and security.","Tansu for developer communities

After a successful POC phase. Tansu is starting to show our vision and can be played with on Testnet.

We have an ambitious proposal for the Build award. Besides the road to mainnet and real adoption, we have two objectives:
1. Offer a decentralized platform for developers to maintain and interact with projects;
2. Add an emphasis on people behind projects through the use of reputation badges.

Decentralized organization

Projects will have access to their own Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community of a project will be able to vote on new features or organizational changes. There are several SCF open source projects we might be able to leverage. The project will have a wallet and the DAO will be used to control the funds allocation. There are going to be mainly two pools. The first pool is dedicated to developers. Funds will be automatically distributed to active maintainers based on specific criteria. The rest of the funds would be managed by the DAO for other purposes such as compensating non-developers, infrastructure costs, or even organizing events. The use of a complex system of redistributions typically used in web3 projects, such as Quadratic Funding (QF), will be evaluated.

Tools will be implemented to add/remove maintainers programmatically based on the on-chain status of the project. To that end, we are already leveraging Soroban Domains and will continue to do so and see how we can extend our partnership. Discussions are in progress to get a standard around metadata for instance.

Other personas will be added on-chain as to give other responsibilities. This will further increase projects' transparency and give all participants some visibility.

Release process on-chain. From triggering the release to registering it.

Add a level of trust per hash. Combining time based rules with additional factors such as voting from maintainers, to mark specific hashes as more trusted: this introduces a finality concept and enables consumers of the contract to use specific trust levels depending on their own risk profile. We will evaluate the possibility to combine this concept with an automatic update of the hash. This would allow a fully trustless mode of operation. Linked to that, we will add tools to reject a hash. As maintainers can get compromised, it is important to have means to indicate that a project and person is compromised.

Finally, users will be able to subscribe to projects to get news about new trusted releases, security related issues and DAO events.

The people behind the code

Behind projects, we have people. We want to add profiles for people registered on-chain and recognise their contributions. We will leverage the solution from Trustful and build yet another sustainable partnership between SCF projects.

Badges are not vanity tokens. They will play an essential role in defining permissions on the protocol. Linked to the DAO, badges will reflect the level of trust the community has in someone.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Mz1cMHRRFikdieiE3SKmVQzDskjQKQiu9ljgVO_I7g/edit?usp=sharing,"Besides completing the tranches, the success of our project will primarily be measured by the number of open-source projects registered. Moving past registrations, we will look at how often on-chain data is updated and how our dApp is used. Note that we will never use any invasive tracking solution on the dApp and only GDPR compliant solutions will be considered.

On the community side, we hope that Tansu will enable more decentralized communities of developers to exist. Ultimatly, we wish for the whole development lifecycle to happen in a decentralized way, outside of solutions like GitHub.

Last but not least, if our project can successfully detect a security incident and warn users effectively, it would be a huge win.",https://tansu.dev,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://youtu.be/JsE4JGm-6Fs,Yes,"As a public good project, we don't yet have concrete monetisation plans. At that point we are more interested into providing monetisation tools to support the projects on our platform. The Support button will allows people to show their support in XLM to a project and if they wish, give a tip to the platform. Monthly options will also be made available and could generate a constant revenue stream.

As we add new features, driven by community feedback, we might add more enterprise oriented features. At that point we are thinking about adding some fees to specific contract calls and features in the dApp itself.

Regardless of a hypothetical monetization, we have a strong commitment toward open-source and our code will remain public. We will ensure that there is a great documentation so that anyone can freely Quickstart our infrastructure and build on top of it as they wish. Consulting Manao GmbH, our company, will also be open for consulting services on Tansu and related technologies.","Pamphile presented Tansu to a ""community call of the mind"" where it was well received. People have also been engaging positively on our project page. We started a collaboration with the Trustful team. And we have been interacting with the Soroban Domains team to propose a specification for an Ersatz of a SEP1 file.

Besides these public communications, Pamphile also interacted with prominent members of the Stellar community and they shared their enthusiasm.

Tansu is just starting on testnet and we just kicked of the public communication phase as we have something people can actually use now. We hope that in the following weeks we will get more traction.","The planning outlined below, and in the other tranches, assumes an average level of effort of 15 per week per person for a total duration of 6 months making it sustainable in terms of development engagement for all parties.
For simplicity, the start of the tranche is represented as W1-for Week 1. While the developers have some affinity, backend/frontend/contract, all developers will be involved on all aspects of the proposal.

Subs,SCF #30,Subs SDK: Scaling Global Subscriptions with Stellar Payments,Subs,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recFudOvNezhmYZig,Awarded,67.0,Pre-Launch #2 - Testnet,$139480.00,$92986.66,544385.43,,Build,Subs offers an SDK to help businesses manage blockchain subscriptions using Stellar's Soroban smart contracts.,"What Subs Is:
Subs SDK is an all-in-one development toolkit specifically designed to enable developers to create, manage, and optimize subscription-based Dapps on Stellar. With a focus on recurring crypto payments, Subs SDK simplifies the integration of blockchain-based subscription services, making it easier for businesses to leverage Stellar’s technology to offer subscription models without complexity.

The Problem:
Managing recurring payments and subscriptions in blockchain environments can be a complex and time-consuming process, particularly for businesses that are accustomed to traditional payment systems. There is a lack of straightforward solutions that combine ease of use with the security and transparency of decentralized payments, making it difficult for companies to adopt blockchain-based subscription models efficiently.

The Solution:
Subs provides a comprehensive SDK that simplifies the creation and management of recurring payment services on Stellar. The Subs SDK offers the following key components:

1. Recurring Payments Automation:
    - Description : Subs SDK simplifies the creation and management of automated, recurring payment systems on Stellar. This allows businesses to handle subscription models with ease, ensuring that customers' payments are processed automatically without manual intervention. With features like smart contract automation, developers can build robust, scalable recurring billing systems in no time.
    - Avantage : Simplifies payment collection and subscription management for businesses, with transparent on-chain validation.

2. Flexible Subscription Models:
    - Description : The SDK supports a variety of subscription models, including daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly subscriptions, with the ability to customize trial periods, SEP-41 token types, and pricing structures. It also allows for ""buy-now, pay-later"" schemes and partial payments.
    - Avantage : Businesses can tailor subscription plans to their specific needs, increasing flexibility and customer satisfaction.Additionally, Subs ensures that all smart contracts are regularly maintained and ""bumped"" to prevent automatic deletion, so businesses don't have to worry about contract expiration or disruption of services​​.

3. Sponsored Transactions for End-Users:
    - Description : Subs SDK integrates a sponsored transaction system where businesses can absorb transaction fees, allowing users to subscribe without worrying about network fees. This is particularly useful in onboarding new crypto users who may be unfamiliar with Stellar's native gas fees. Additionally, users could benefit from a faucet option, where merchants can provide the XLMs needed to activate their addresses and sponsor transactions, further simplifying the onboarding process.
    - Avantage : This approach improves user experience by removing common friction points in blockchain transactions, increasing subscription rates. By offering both sponsored transactions and a merchant-supported faucet, we make it easier for new users to engage with the platform and participate in the ecosystem.

4. Multi-Currency Support and Cross-Chain Compatibility:
    - Description : Subs SDK will support multiple tokens such as stablecoins like USDC. 
    - Avantage : This feature will attract businesses that operate globally and need to cater to users using different currencies.

5. Data Privacy and Decentralized Security:
    - Description : Leveraging Stellar's Soroban smart contract framework, Subs SDK ensures all payment transactions and subscription data are securely stored on-chain without exposing sensitive personal information. Data is stored on Aleph and encrypted, similar to how emails are secured, guaranteeing that subscription details are immutable and verifiable.
    - Avantage : Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reassuring businesses and users that their financial and personal data are secure.

6. Developer-Friendly Tools & API Integration:
    - Description : Subs SDK offers robust API support, that provides real-time insights into subscription performance, customer retention, and payment success rates.

Every Finance is a decentralized finance platform offering decentralized Exchange-Traded Funds (dETFs). It features diversified investments across major blockchains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon networks), rebalanced with proprietary algorithms based on risk parity principles. The platform aims to democratize hedge fund advantages and index fund diversification, making optimized yield farming accessible to all. Every Finance focuses on providing simple, secure, and effective portfolio management in the volatile crypto space.

The Problem:
Managing and optimizing investments in the complex and rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is a real challenge. Specifically, how to solve the problem of navigating the volatility, risk, and fragmented nature of the DeFi ecosystem. 

The Solution:
By offering a platform that combines 
- sophisticated risk management, 
- automated portfolio rebalancing, 
- and yield optimization through DeFi strategies, 
Every.Finance empowers users to create and manage diversified portfolios that are tailored to their specific risk tolerance and financial goals. The platform simplifies the process of accessing high-yield opportunities while maintaining control over risk, making DeFi more accessible and effective for both novice and experienced investors..

How Every.Finance Works on Stellar
Every.Finance operates as an intelligent investment platform that allows users to create and manage diversified portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and financial objectives. Here’s how it works:
1. Portfolio Creation: Users start by selecting a risk level (e.g., conservative, balanced, aggressive) or customizing their own asset allocations based on personal preferences. The platform offers various investment products like Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, each representing different risk-return profiles.
2. Asset Selection and Allocation: Based on the chosen risk profile, Every.Finance allocates funds across a diversified mix of assets, such as stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets. These assets are selected using an in-house strategy that emphasizes both potential returns and risk management.
3. Yield Optimization: Once assets are allocated, they are farmed using various DeFi strategies, such as staking, liquidity provision, and yield farming, to generate additional income or ""extra yield."" This step is automated, leveraging the best opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem to enhance returns.
4. Automated and User Rebalancing: To maintain the desired risk-return profile, Every.Finance periodically rebalances the portfolio. Market rebalancing occurs automatically based on market conditions, while user rebalancing allows investors to manually adjust allocations according to their evolving strategies.
5. Risk Management: Throughout the process, robust risk management protocols ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the investor’s risk tolerance. This involves careful selection of assets, strategic deployment in DeFi, and constant monitoring to mitigate potential risks.
6. Fees and Profit Sharing: The platform charges management and performance fees, which are calculated based on the performance of the portfolio and are periodically deducted. A portion of performance fees is allocated to a profit-sharing pool, allowing users to benefit collectively from successful strategies.

Uses of Every.Finance
- For New Investors: Provides an accessible entry point into the DeFi space, with automated portfolio management and risk mitigation tools that simplify investing.
- For Experienced Investors: Offers advanced features such as custom portfolio creation, manual rebalancing, and access to high-yield DeFi strategies, allowing for greater control and optimization.
- For Yield Seekers: Enables investors to maximize their returns by leveraging DeFi strategies like yield farming and staking, which are typically complex and time-consuming to manage independently.
- For Risk-Conscious Investors: Offers tailored risk management, ensuring that portfolios remain within acceptable risk levels while still seeking to generate returns.

This dual focus on innovative development and user onboarding will ensure the long-term success and growth of Stellar zkCrossDEX.",https://stellar.zkcross.exchange/,https://github.com/zkCross-Network,https://youtu.be/2zqDpO_l_8Q?si=k-zEiuVgv4QA3dz8,Yes,"After completing the Stellar zkCrossDEX Phase Two development, our go-to-market strategy will focus on an extensive Airdrop Program where we’ve allocated 2% of the token supply of our upcoming $CROSS token to drive user adoption and promote zkCrossDEX. This will involve:

	1.	Quests & Challenges: Engaging users with specific tasks and rewarding them for completing various activities within zkCrossDEX.
	2.	Referral Program: Incentivizing users to invite others into the ecosystem, creating a viral loop of growth and adoption.
	3.	Leaderboards: Adding a competitive element where top participants earn extra rewards.

This approach will create excitement, incentivise engagement, and rapidly expand our user base. Additionally, through this program, the Stellar community will be able to experience and use zkCrossDEX, further solidifying their involvement.

We will leverage multiple channels for promotion, including partnerships, influencer marketing, and social media campaigns, ensuring wide visibility and participation.","We have made significant strides with Stellar zkCrossDEX during Phase One, introducing critical innovations:

1.	Fiat OnRamp Integration: We successfully integrated Transak, enabling seamless fiat-to-crypto onboarding across Stellar and EVM chains.

2.	Cross-Chain Transactions: We launched one-click cross-chain transactions on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, abstracting DeFi complexities such as gas, swaps, and bridging.

3.	DeFi Complexity Abstraction: Automated transaction processes for a simplified DeFi user experience.

While the $90k grant will contribute to our development efforts, it will not cover the entire cost of building out the full features of Stellar zkCrossDEX Phase Two as outlined in the three tranches above. 

However, we are fully committed to our long-term vision for this project. To expedite development and maximise the opportunity presented by the upcoming bull run, we are willing to allocate our resources to fast-track these initiatives. Our goal is to complete our long-term vision before the end of this year, ensuring Stellar zkCrossDEX is fully optimised for the DeFi landscape.",Shivam Tandon,Logo-Socials.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/43/43/1752580800000/E_VOPgLk3s2zcKnqRXuGHQ/jOAHxtrOvvLJgjy921AJ8i4mWW_jNUl8xL0NQf03OMywxdz1dMvubYwg-5BtOFewXf0bi0RJtvS46ktDH9hQ_H88fbJK0XDvRcfX3h-tEEVoJlU-mIiAttnLdTAGPCnp2bDe64cdDULwm9_ZZHgu9gDXhFlM0x1LfAZ-YsVL_HM/OVSS5g7oKDVMbyhpj_N961u0WY6p8S-tKcS0NCRtQIU),https://www.linkedin.com/company/zkcrossnetwork,https://twitter.com/zkCrossNetwork,,
