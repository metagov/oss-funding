    "description": "'- We pay community members from around the world using Celo (cUSD), using the Valora wallet. For additional proof, all transactions are displayed on our GainForest transparency platform. Attached below is a short video of the transactions, as well as a blogpost documenting our measure-to-earn program:\nhttps://gainforest.substack.com/p/what-is-gainforests-measure-to-earn\n- We plan to have all transactions referenced in a Celo attestation expressing the motive of the transaction. So far, a portion of the transactions are already visible here: https://celo.easscan.org/address/0x00da1b2D16c777D8Be7656C6780d23a98292c0ee\n- We have minted and plan to continue minting hypercerts to illustrate the environmental work done by a particular project.
