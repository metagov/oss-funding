Nigeria's growing tech scene and pressing environmental challenges provide us with both the motivation and opportunity to innovate.

Being in a country that grapples with significant waste management issues, our project is uniquely positioned to address local environmental concerns while leveraging blockchain technology to incentivize community involvement in recycling efforts. This geographic location helps us to build solutions that are not only scalable but also directly impactful for underserved communities that stand to benefit the most from sustainability-driven innovation.",No,,"At EarthFi, we are focused on addressing environmental challenges, specifically plastic waste, by utilizing blockchain technology to create a regenerative economy. Our contributions to the ecosystem center around leveraging decentralized tools to incentivize communities to recycle and manage waste more effectively.Contributions and Progress:Blockchain-Based Recycling Incentives: We are developing a platform that rewards users for recycling plastic waste using blockchain technology. The goal is to create a transparent and verifiable system where participants earn digital rewards for their contributions to environmental sustainability. Our initial pilot has already taken place in Lagos, Nigeria, where we engaged communities and successfully collected over 10 tons of plastic waste manually.Community Engagement and Education: As part of our mission, we also focus on educating local communities about the environmental and economic benefits of recycling. By raising awareness and creating incentives for proper waste management, we are building a sustainable model that fosters long-term change.Expanding Impact: Our future plan involves scaling the platform across multiple regions in Africa and beyond. With the funding from this Micro Pool, we aim to onboard new users, strengthen our blockchain infrastructure, and develop a seamless, user-friendly mobile app to enhance accessibility.Timelines and Objectives: Q1 2025: Platform MVP with blockchain rewards launched. Q2 2025: Expansion into new regions in Nigeria, increasing our plastic recycling capacity by 50%. Q3 2025: Partnering with local recycling facilities to process over 50 tons of plastic waste.Measurable Objective: By the end of Q2 2025, our measurable objective is to have at least 5000 active users engaged in recycling activities, with 20 tons of plastic waste recycled using EarthFi's blockchain incentive model. This aligns with Celo’s mission of fostering prosperity, as it not only provides environmental benefits but also economic opportunities for underserved communities.","By the end of our development, the Celo Community will have access to a pioneering platform that uses blockchain technology to drive environmental sustainability and economic empowerment. EarthFi will serve as a model for leveraging decentralized technology to solve real-world problems, demonstrating the power of blockchain in creating positive social and environmental impact. The open-source nature of the project, coupled with comprehensive documentation and community engagement efforts, ensures that the Celo Community can continue to build upon and benefit from EarthFi long after the initial development phase.","The funding will be allocated to key areas that will support the growth and development of EarthFi's recycling platform. Specifically, the money will be used for platform development, enhancing our blockchain infrastructure to ensure transparency, security, and scalability. This includes building features for seamless tracking of recycling activities and rewarding participants. It will also be used for mobile app development to create a user-friendly application that allows communities to participate in recycling activities, track their contributions, and earn rewards.Additionally, we will focus on community outreach and engagement, expanding our efforts to educate and engage local communities in Nigeria, with a focus on increasing awareness of the environmental and economic benefits of recycling. Operational costs will be covered to support the logistics of collecting and processing plastic waste, including partnerships with local recycling facilities to ensure efficient waste management.Lastly, part of the funding will be used for team expansion by hiring additional team members, including blockchain developers and community coordinators, to help scale the platform and manage day-to-day operations more effectively. The overall goal is to enhance the platform's functionality, expand our impact, and accelerate the adoption of blockchain-based recycling solutions.","Yes, EarthFi's approach is unique in that it processes plastic delivery and payment on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, creating a decentralized recycling ecosystem. This model allows individuals and communities to interact directly without the need for intermediaries, ensuring faster and more transparent transactions.By using P2P delivery and payment methods, EarthFi empowers local recyclers and waste collectors to directly trade plastic waste with recycling centers or other participants in the network. This not only reduces transaction costs but also increases efficiency in the recycling process. Our model leverages blockchain technology to securely record these transactions, ensuring transparency and trust between parties.This decentralized approach complements the current landscape by addressing inefficiencies in traditional recycling systems, where intermediaries often slow down the process and limit rewards for those at the grassroots level. EarthFi’s P2P structure puts power back into the hands of individuals, encouraging more active participation in recycling efforts and building stronger, localized recycling economies.","Yes, there are other protocols and services working within the recycling and waste management space. Several platforms focus on incentivizing recycling through blockchain technology.Some of these platforms utilize token-based reward systems or aim to connect recyclers with stakeholders in more centralized ways.We’ve researched these services, and what sets EarthFi apart is our emphasis on a peer-to-peer (P2P) delivery and payment system for plastic waste collection. Many existing platforms still rely on intermediaries or centralized entities to process transactions, which can introduce delays, increase costs, and limit local engagement.",Yes,Yes,Yes

By Q1 2025, we’ll have customized our API for seamless integration into Celo’s mobile-first, eco-friendly blockchain, aiming to onboard at least five platforms and generate $100,000 in donations within the first year.With a focus on mobile optimization and community engagement, we’ll work with Celo-based partners on co-marketing to promote frictionless social impact. This Micro Pool funding will accelerate our development and help us build partnerships, allowing Coala Pay to enhance financial inclusion and sustainability within Celo’s ecosystem.","Coala Pay aims to make social impact a seamless part of everyday blockchain transactions by enabling users to easily donate a portion of their transaction costs to vetted grassroots aid projects. By integrating with Celo, we aim to empower Celo users to contribute directly to meaningful causes with just a few clicks, promoting financial inclusion and sustainability.For the Celo community, Coala Pay offers a unique way to enhance the utility of Celo’s eco-friendly, mobile-first blockchain. Community members gain access to tools that let them support global aid efforts directly from their favorite Celo-based platforms. This adds real-world impact to Celo transactions, strengthens community engagement, and aligns with Celo’s mission of fostering prosperity and positive change worldwide.","The grant will help us adapt Coala Pay’s donation API for Celo, making it easy for users to add donations to their transactions on Celo’s eco-friendly, mobile-focused blockchain. Funds will go toward technical development, mobile optimization, and getting our first Celo platform partners on board. We’ll also use some of the funds for marketing to spread the word and get Celo users excited about supporting grassroots aid projects directly through their transactions.","Yes our approach is unique because it embeds donations directly into blockchain transactions, allowing users to effortlessly “round up” and support grassroots aid projects. Unlike other platforms that focus on traditional nonprofits and often convert crypto to fiat, Coala Pay keeps funds on-chain, ensuring full transparency and traceability.What sets us apart further is the use of dynamic tokens, which allow donors to track their impact in real-time, creating a more engaging and personalized experience. By making social impact a seamless part of everyday blockchain activity, Coala Pay introduces a simple, direct way for Celo users to give back while staying fully within the Web3 ecosystem.At the same time, there are some alternatives like we are essentially operating something like Global Giving, but on web3. The Giving Block is the closest web3 competitor, but they don't offer a means of donating on-page, users have to go to their website or a charity website to donate. Global Giving custodies the funds before the move to local partners, obscuring how they move, they also work in fiat, which means their funding loses value as it moves across traditional banking wires. The Giving Block requires users to come to their our the recipient's page to give, it is not integrated. Users can't automatically track their impact with either competitor.","Yes, there are other services like The Giving Block and Endaoment, but they mainly focus on donations to large nonprofits and often convert crypto to fiat, which can reduce transparency.Coala Pay does things differently. We make it easy for users to add donations directly into their blockchain transactions, with a focus on grassroots aid projects that keep funds on-chain for full transparency. Plus, donors get dynamic tokens to track the impact of their contributions in real-time. Our approach is about embedding giving right into the Web3 experience, making it simple, direct, and fully transparent for Celo users.","Although Coala Pay is not yet built on Celo, the community will soon be able to interact with our platform through Celo-based applications. Once integrated, users can add donations directly to their transactions, seamlessly supporting grassroots aid projects. Coala Pay will also provide tools like donation widgets and APIs, allowing Celo-based platforms to embed social impact into their services. This means Celo users can effortlessly support meaningful causes while staying within the Celo ecosystem, making giving a natural part of their blockchain experience.",Yes,Yes

By joining the Celo ecosystem, we intend to build a scalable, eco-friendly platform that democratizes ownership, empowering users to be active contributors rather than passive products. For the Celo community, this means fostering a new model of digital interaction, one that promotes sustainability, user empowerment, and authentic engagement while onboarding millions of new users into the web3 space.","The grant from Celo will be used to accelerate development and marketing efforts for Republike. Specifically, funds will go towards finalizing our native mobile app for both iOS and Android, expanding our infrastructure to handle rapid user growth, and enhancing our acquisition strategies to attract and onboard users. This financial support will enable us to create a seamless experience for new users, integrate with Celo’s eco-friendly blockchain, and scale our platform quickly, helping us bring the “pay-to-own” social media model to a broader audience.","Yes, Republike is unique in its approach to social media. Unlike traditional platforms that rely on attention-driven, ad-based revenue models, Republike introduces a “pay-to-own” model where users become co-owners and beneficiaries of the platform. This shift not only aligns user incentives with the community’s well-being but also fosters a more positive and sustainable digital environment. While most Web3 social media projects focus solely on decentralization, Republike goes a step further by embedding community-focused values directly into the platform, creating an ecosystem that promotes respect, altruism, and long-term engagement. This approach uniquely addresses the core issues of existing social media while bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 users.","We are often asked by new users or people looking at the project from outside """"what is the difference with Twitter / X?"""" then when they jump in they realize it's kinda Twitter-like but based on an anti-Twitter engagement model in the sense that it's been conceived and designed to fix X-like issues, notably regarding the tricky problem of free speech and violence. The problem with web3 social media solution so far is that it has been designed to fix web 2.0 issues but it targets web3 people, not people suffering the pains: web 2.0 average user. As an example, when Musk bought Twitter, a lot of users have been scared and flew to Mastodon (which is not even the more complicated / web3 social media).Nevertheless, a way to present the global competitive landscape of Social Media Industry could be the following:Global dominant platforms (web 2.): Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/LinkedinWeb2.0 Challengers : Mastodon/Gettr/Truth and some other playersWeb3 challengers & protocols: Lens / FarCaster / WarpCast / MindsThat to say there is no direct competition, at least that advanced in terms of solution: we are the only social media project attacking directly at the root the free business model (attention economy) while addressing the target suffering the pain: the web2.We have better and deeper engagement model based on the translation of values universally good for all directly in the product and the code on the top of decentralization. Moreover, we are fixing web 2.0 pains and addressing the right target (Web 2.0) with web3 tech => bridging web 2.0 and web3.","Currently, Republike is not yet built on Celo, but we’re excited to explore the possibilities of integrating with the Celo ecosystem. In the meantime, the community can interact with Republike through our existing platform, where they can sign up, create accounts, and participate in a growing social media experience that aligns personal rewards with community-driven values. We also welcome the Celo community to join our early adopters, provide feedback, and engage in our upcoming discussions on how to integrate sustainable blockchain solutions like Celo to enhance our platform’s ecological impact and scalability.",Yes,Yes

Ghana is still relatively new to blockchain technology, so we are taking an educational first approach, starting with two key meetups.In our first in-person event (scheduled for February 2025), we will introduce people to Celo focusing on its decentralized financial tools, and community governance. This will be a hands-on session, where attendees can directly see how Celo can impact financial access and inclusion, particularly in a mobile-dependent market like Ghana. We plan to build excitement, spark questions, and get people thinking about how they can actively participate.Shortly after, we’ll follow up with an online meetup for a wider audience across Ghana. This session will dive deeper into how Celo’s governance works and how local participants can get involved in decision-making processes. We want to create a genuine Celo community here, a space where people can share experiences, learn, and grow within the ecosystem.The Micro Pool funding will directly support these events, allowing us to cover logistics, event materials, and outreach, especially to reach people who may not have easy access to blockchain education. Our measurable goal is to engage 60 - 80 active members in 3 months, with a core group dedicated to participating in Celo ecosystem activities including governance. This is not just a one-time introduction, it’s about planting the seeds for a lasting, impactful Celo community in Ghana.","Our project, Celo Ghana Community, aims to create a thriving network of Ghanaians who understand, engage with, and contribute to the Celo ecosystem. By holding in-person and online meetup, we’ll introduce Celo’s tools for financial inclusion, focusing on empowering locals with knowledge about decentralized finance and governance.For the broader Celo Community, this project opens up a new geographic hub in West Africa, fostering local leadership and innovation in the ecosystem. Our initiative provides a tangible, community-driven expansion that could inspire similar efforts globally.","The Micro Pool grant will be carefully allocated across several areas to ensure our Celo Ghana Community - Northern regions project makes the biggest possible impact:Venue and Setup for In-Person Meetup: A significant portion will cover venue rental, seating arrangements, and refreshments, creating a comfortable and engaging environment that encourages attendees to learn, network, and participate actively.Virtual Meetup Infrastructure: We’ll invest in digital tools (such as webinar hosting and presentation software) to ensure our online meetup is smooth, accessible, and interactive, allowing us to reach a broader audience beyond those who can attend in person.Educational Materials: To make the information digestible and lasting, part of the budget will go toward printing flyers, handouts, and presentations that explain Celo’s core principles, governance, and opportunities for involvement.Community Promotion and Outreach: To attract a diverse audience, we’ll allocate funds for targeted marketing, both digital and local, ensuring we reach people new to blockchain. This will include social media campaigns, posters, and community outreach to drive awareness and attendance.Follow-Up and Ongoing Engagement: Finally, a portion of the funds will support follow-up activities, including small incentives for continued participation and resources for members interested in Celo governance.With this funding, we’ll have the resources to establish a lasting Celo presence in Ghana, giving our community the structure to grow and sustain itself long-term.","Yes, our idea is unique in its focus on building a dedicated Ghanaian community around the Celo ecosystem, which remains largely unknown here. While blockchain education initiatives are growing, few focus specifically on Celo’s governance, mobile-first design, and potential for financial inclusion. We’re not only introducing Celo to Ghana but also creating an ongoing community structure, giving locals a voice and a chance to engage with Celo’s governance long-term. This tailored, community-first approach sets our project apart in the current blockchain landscape.","Yes, other protocols like Internet Computer, Filecoin and Cardano are active in Ghana, each offering some form of blockchain education or community events. However, our approach with Celo Ghana Community is unique in its targeted focus on Celo’s mobile-first ecosystem and governance model. Unlike general blockchain meetups, we’re introducing locals directly to the specific benefits of Celo, such as its accessible transaction fees and emphasis on financial inclusion, while creating pathways for ongoing governance involvement, a tangible distinction.","While Celo Ghana Community-Northern Regions is not a direct product built on Celo, our project actively fosters engagement with the Celo ecosystem by educating Ghanaians on its features and governance. Through our meetups, attendees will learn how to interact with Celo's platform—such as creating wallets, using Celo’s financial tools, and engaging in governance discussions. Our community will be an entry point for Ghanaians in the Northern part of Ghana to become involved, making Celo more accessible and relevant in Ghana’s landscape.",Yes,Yes

With Switzerland’s strong blockchain and finance focus, we’re in a great spot to connect Celo’s mission with an audience that really values financial inclusion and sustainability. Plus, all our content will be created by a native English speaker, so we can be sure it’ll resonate with new audiences looking to explore what Celo has to offer.","We’re part of STORM Partners, a Geneva-based team that helps Web3 startups and ecosystems get the support they need—whether it’s legal advice, marketing, fundraising, or operational help. We're focused on helping ecosystems reach new markets and getting people excited about decentralized tech. Working on this project fits right in, as we’re all about sharing knowledge and driving adoption, which is exactly what we hope to do with Celo.",,"We’re excited to contribute to the Celo ecosystem by creating a series of short-form videos designed to showcase real-world projects built on Celo. Our goal is to drive awareness and engagement, especially in Switzerland and other English-speaking regions, by highlighting how Celo supports financial inclusion, sustainability, and decentralized solutions.Timeline and Progress: We plan to produce 8 to 10 high-quality videos within three months of receiving the grant. So far, we’ve established a content outline and researched the key Celo projects that align with these values. This grant would enable us to finalize the scripts, streamline production, and amplify the videos on social media to maximize reach.Measurable Objective: Our key objective is to generate 10,000 cumulative views and 500 engagements (likes, comments, shares) across platforms with this initial series. While the numbers may seem modest, this is highly targeted content designed to reach audiences in high-value markets like Switzerland and other English-speaking countries, where even modest numbers can yield meaningful engagement and growth for Celo’s mission.Ultimately, we see this project as a way to foster long-term vitality for the Celo ecosystem by introducing more people to Celo’s mission and inspiring them to explore or build within the network.","This project aims to accomplish two main goals:Highlighting Current Celo Ecosystem Projects: By creating short-form videos, we’ll spotlight both Celo and the innovative projects within its ecosystem, showcasing their contributions to financial inclusion, sustainability, and decentralized finance. These videos will make Celo’s impact more visible and accessible, appealing to both current community members and newcomers.Building Awareness in English-Speaking Markets: With a focus on Switzerland and other English-speaking countries, we aim to introduce Celo to high-value audiences who may not yet be familiar with the platform. The Celo community will gain greater recognition and a broader support base in strategic regions, building connections with potential future builders and investors in Celo projects.Through these efforts, we hope to connect more people with Celo’s mission, inspiring them to explore or even build within the Celo ecosystem.","The funds will be used to cover the research, filming, editing, and production of 8–10 short-form videos. Each video will spotlight Celo and projects within the Celo ecosystem, with a focus on financial inclusion, sustainability, and decentralized finance. Additionally, funds will support the promotion of these videos across public social media channels, ensuring they reach target audiences in Switzerland and English-speaking regions. By using these funds strategically, we can deliver high-quality content that effectively raises awareness and engagement for the Celo community.","Yes, this idea is unique to the Celo ecosystem. While Celo has some educational resources and video content, our project brings short-form, easily digestible videos—one of the most popular and accessible content formats right now. These videos are designed to capture attention quickly and make Celo’s mission, values, and ecosystem projects understandable and engaging for a broader audience, especially in Switzerland and other English-speaking regions.By focusing on high-quality, bite-sized content, we’re providing something new to the Celo community that meets the current demand for quick, impactful learning. This format, popular on platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok, will help bridge the gap between Celo’s mission and the mainstream audience, making it easier for people to see the real-world impact of Celo projects. Given the need for relatable and accessible Web3 content, this series is likely to be both impactful and much needed within the Celo ecosystem.","While there’s some short-form content out there for other blockchain platforms, there’s still a big gap when it comes to videos specifically highlighting projects in the Celo ecosystem. Most Celo-related content tends to be longer and more technical, which can be a barrier for people who want quick, engaging insights.Our project aims to change that by creating concise, high-quality videos that really spotlight what makes Celo unique. We’re focusing on platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok, where people are already looking for easily digestible content. By keeping things short and engaging, we’re making Celo more accessible and appealing, especially to audiences in Switzerland and other English-speaking regions who might not yet be familiar with what Celo offers.This sets us apart by catering to the viewing habits of today’s audiences, which we think will help drive more interest and visibility for Celo.","This project isn’t directly built on Celo but is designed to reach audiences who may not yet be familiar with Celo, introducing them to the chain and the innovative projects within its ecosystem. By making the videos publicly available, we aim to spark curiosity and drive engagement from outside the current Celo community. For those already building on Celo, these videos will reinforce a sense of pride and community, highlighting the ecosystem’s unique contributions to financial inclusion and sustainability.",Yes,Yes

This service is especially valuable to African communities facing economic challenges, empowering them to meet immediate financial needs while keeping their assets invested.Current Progress and TimelineWe have already deployed our smart contract on Celo, along with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Gnosis, and Optimism. For our pilot phase, we’re using a Safe smart contract setup that has enabled us to test the concept, with over $1,000 in active loans facilitated. With this Micro Pool funding, we aim to:Enhance our platform's smart contract for Celo, allowing streamlined staking, borrowing, and loan redemption for users in the ecosystem. This upgrade will also support the anticipated transition to Celo’s new Layer 2, aligning our development with Celo’s evolving technical landscape.Launch a focused campaign to onboard Celo users within our target markets, encouraging adoption and providing financial flexibility to underserved communities.Measurable ObjectiveOne key objective is to achieve active Celo users actively staking assets and accessing loans through aboki.eth within 12 months of integration. This measurable goal aligns with Celo’s mission of fostering prosperity by empowering users with access to decentralized financial services.Through this funding, we can accelerate our integration, refine our smart contract, and engage Celo’s user base with a tailored approach. This will lay the foundation for further growth, ultimately creating a more prosperous ecosystem within Celo.","Project Goal and Benefits to the Celo CommunityOur primary goal with aboki.eth is to provide a decentralized platform that enables users to stake digital assets and access fiat loans. This model is designed to address financial needs, especially for communities across Africa, where economic constraints often limit access to flexible, secure financial tools. By offering a simple way for users to tap into the value of their crypto assets without needing to sell them, aboki.eth provides a valuable alternative to traditional finance.For the Celo Community, aboki.eth creates opportunities to leverage the platform's assets and engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) in a meaningful way. With our upcoming integration of Celo's new Layer 2, users can expect smoother transactions, reduced fees, and greater scalability—keeping them engaged within the Celo ecosystem.Value to the Celo CommunityThe Celo community benefits by gaining a tool that fosters financial inclusion. aboki.eth aims to drive user growth within the Celo ecosystem, strengthening the network’s utility as a go-to platform for asset-backed, DeFi-powered loans that meet real-world needs in emerging markets.","The $2,000 grant will be allocated primarily toward the development and testing of aboki.eth's smart contract and user interface, specifically for integration with the Celo ecosystem. Our primary focus areas include:Smart Contract Enhancement and Testing ($1,200)Upgrade our smart contract to be compatible with Celo’s new Layer 2 infrastructure, ensuring seamless staking, borrowing, and loan redemption functionalities. Conduct extensive testing on Celo’s testnet to optimize for efficiency, security, and stability, minimizing any risks before deployment. User Interface (UI) Development ($600)Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies asset staking, loan requests, and repayments, especially for users new to DeFi. Ensure that the UI aligns with the needs of Celo’s user base, focusing on accessibility and a localized experience. Community Outreach and Onboarding ($200)Conduct small-scale onboarding sessions to gather feedback from initial Celo users, which will help refine the platform and ensure it meets community needs. Promote awareness within the Celo community to encourage early adoption. This funding will accelerate our efforts to bring aboki.eth to Celo, creating a streamlined, secure, and accessible platform that supports Celo’s mission of financial inclusion.","Is aboki.eth Unique?Yes, aboki.eth is unique in its approach to financial inclusion by combining asset-backed lending with a focus on user-friendly staking across multiple blockchain networks, including Celo. Unlike most DeFi lending platforms, aboki.eth is designed specifically for users in underserved regions, particularly in Africa, where economic constraints limit access to traditional financial services. Our platform provides a flexible alternative by enabling users to stake digital assets and access fiat loans, helping them meet immediate financial needs without losing long-term investments.What Makes aboki.eth Stand OutLocalized Financial Solution: Unlike many DeFi platforms that primarily cater to crypto-savvy users, aboki.eth is tailored for communities with limited access to financial services, focusing on real-world solutions for users facing challenging economic situations.Cross-Chain Flexibility: aboki.eth allows users to engage with the platform on various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Optimism, and Celo, giving users flexibility and control over their preferred networks.Seamless Celo Layer 2 Integration: As Celo transitions to Layer 2, aboki.eth will be optimized to leverage this enhanced scalability and cost-efficiency, benefiting users with reduced fees and smoother transactions.Complementing the Current Landscapeaboki.eth complements the existing DeFi landscape by filling a gap in asset-backed lending tailored specifically to emerging markets. Our integration with Celo aligns with its mission of fostering financial inclusion, offering an accessible platform that not only supports but also grows Celo's ecosystem by bringing new users who may not typically engage with traditional DeFi platforms.","Yes, several protocols and services operate in the same general area as aboki.eth, specifically in asset-backed lending and staking within decentralized finance (DeFi). Examples include:AaveAave is one of the largest DeFi lending platforms, allowing users to borrow and lend various crypto assets. It uses over-collateralization for loans but does not specifically cater to emerging markets or provide fiat loans directly. CompoundCompound is a DeFi protocol that enables users to lend and borrow crypto assets with a focus on earning interest. Like Aave, it operates solely with crypto assets and doesn’t focus on fiat lending or the unique needs of emerging markets. Celo's Moola MarketMoola Market, native to the Celo ecosystem, offers a similar DeFi lending and borrowing service where users can borrow against their crypto holdings. However, Moola primarily deals with crypto-to-crypto lending and does not specifically offer fiat loans backed by staked crypto assets.Research and Tangible DifferencesWe have carefully researched these protocols and identified key ways in which aboki.eth will differentiate itself:Focus on Fiat Loans for Emerging MarketsWhile most DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound, and Moola Market focus on crypto-to-crypto lending, aboki.eth is one of the few aiming to provide fiat loans against staked assets. This feature is specifically tailored to the needs of African and other emerging-market users, where accessing fiat liquidity directly is more practical and impactful than simply borrowing additional crypto. Staking Rewards Integrationaboki.eth offers users the opportunity to earn staking rewards on their assets while they are used as collateral. This is relatively unique in DeFi lending, as most platforms focus solely on lending and borrowing without rewarding users on their staked assets. Multi-Chain Compatibility with Celo L2 IntegrationUnlike most protocols that are isolated on a single blockchain, aboki.eth is designed to operate across multiple chains (Ethereum, BNB, Gnosis, etc.) and will support Celo’s upcoming Layer 2. This approach is designed to provide users with flexibility and choice, aligning with the unique needs and network preferences of diverse user groups. In summary, aboki.eth is tangibly different because it combines fiat lending, staking rewards, and multi-chain compatibility, making it a unique and valuable addition to the DeFi ecosystem and especially appealing to Celo’s mission of financial inclusion.","Built on Celo ConfirmationOur project, aboki.eth, is currently deployed as a multi-chain smart contract wallet that includes support for Celo, allowing our community to interact with our platform. At present, we use a Safe app and a multi-chain smart contract wallet to manage staking and loans, which requires some manual processes for loan issuance and redemption. This setup is designed to test the concept and enable preliminary interactions with Celo and other networks.With the support of this grant, we aim to streamline the system by moving away from the manual processes involved in our current setup. This funding will enable us to develop a dedicated smart contract specifically for Celo, allowing us to fully automate staking, borrowing, and repayment functionalities in a more user-friendly, decentralized experience.In summary, while aboki.eth has an initial presence on Celo, this grant will help us transition from a partially manual, multi-chain system to a fully-integrated, Celo-optimized platform. This will enable the Celo community to engage more seamlessly with our services as we progress in our development.",Yes,Yes

Celo en Acción is specifically designed to educate and onboard Spanish-speaking users in Latin America through a practical, interactive format. While there are existing resources on how to use Celo, few are tailored to this audience with a culturally relevant and language-accessible focus.Our project goes beyond traditional tutorials by integrating a hands-on challenge that reinforces learning through real-world tasks, such as sending a transaction in cUSD or participating in community groups and in the Celo governance. This active learning model is innovative within the Celo ecosystem, as it encourages participants not only to watch and learn but also to practice and engage directly with Celo’s tools.This unique approach will help bridge the gap for new users, making Celo’s technology more accessible and relevant, particularly in a region with a high demand for financial inclusion solutions.","Yes, there are other protocols and educational initiatives focused on onboarding users to decentralized finance, including some specifically targeting the Spanish-speaking community. Protocols like Ethereum and Polygon, for example, have produced educational content to introduce users to Web3 and DeFi.We have researched these existing educational efforts and identified key areas where Celo en Acción will differentiate itself:Celo-Specific, Hands-On Approach: While general DeFi tutorials exist, few initiatives focus on practical education specifically for the Celo ecosystem. Our program is not only tailored to Celo’s unique tools—such as cUSD for remittances and Celo-compatible DApps—but also integrates a hands-on challenge that encourages real interaction with these tools, helping users feel confident in applying them in everyday life.Localized and Culturally Relevant Content: Celo en Acción is crafted specifically for Spanish-speaking users in Latin America, incorporating region-specific use cases like affordable remittances. This focus on localization makes the learning experience more relevant and relatable, which is essential in fostering trust and engagement in a new technology.Incentivized Engagement for Sustained Adoption: Unlike other programs that offer one-time educational resources, we’re using a challenge format with incentives, creating an interactive experience that motivates participants to not only learn but also apply what they’ve learned. This incentive-based approach encourages ongoing engagement, supporting Celo’s goals for long-term user growth and community building.By focusing on these unique aspects, Celo en Acción stands out as an accessible, practical, and culturally adapted educational experience that can effectively drive adoption within the Celo ecosystem in Latin America.","Our project, Celo en Acción is not a product built on Celo but rather an educational initiative designed to empower new users within the Celo ecosystem. Our focus is on helping users understand and engage with the Celo platform through practical learning experiences, including setting up a wallet, using cUSD, participate in the Celo governance and exploring Celo-compatible DApps.The Celo community can interact with our project by participating in the Desafío Celo challenge.

Most of our psychologists provide international psychotherapy, and there is a big opportunity for them to use decentralized payment systems on Celo as it potentially helps improve the financial health by avoiding high transaction fees and long waiting times. ",No,,"We have been integrating Celo as a foundational solution for our decentralized payment system, which involves onboarding our network of psychologists into the Celo ecosystem. This integration process requires each professional to download and set up a Valora wallet, followed by hands-on guidance on how to transact within the network. This ensures that they can seamlessly access and utilize decentralized payments, enhancing financial inclusion and efficiency for their services.Additionally, we are providing educational NFT certificates minted on the Celo network via the Rarible platform, offering verified, blockchain-based credentials to our participants. To date, we have successfully onboarded nine psychologists with Valora wallets and are projected to reach 11 wallets within the coming days. This initial step is crucial in fostering adoption and engagement with the Celo network, driving transaction activity and building familiarity with decentralized finance tools. This Micro Pool funding supports our ongoing efforts by facilitating training, content creation, and engagement activities aimed at expanding our user base within the Celo ecosystem. A measurable objective for this initiative is to onboard at least 20 psychologists by February, each actively transacting within the Celo network, thus fostering prosperity and creating sustained value through decentralized health and education services.","Our project aims to revolutionize mental health services through a decentralized approach using the Celo network. By integrating Celo as the foundation for payment transactions and certification, we provide an innovative, inclusive, and transparent platform for psychotherapy and professional training. This integration not only ensures seamless payments but also introduces mental health professionals and users to blockchain technology, creating a bridge between Web3 and critical real-world services.What does the Celo Community get?Increased Transaction Volume:Psychotherapy Sessions: Each psychologist transacting on the platform generates an average of 3-5 sessions per day at $25 per session. This results in a potential monthly transaction volume per psychologist between $1,650 and $2,750 USD, assuming 22 working days. Educational Transactions: Course and certification enrollments create an additional $1,000 to $5,000 USD monthly per group of psychologists engaging with our academy. These transactions boost network activity, demonstrating Celo's utility in real-world education and service delivery. 2. On-Chain Engagement via POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocols): We incentivize therapy attendance and active participation through the issuance of POAPs for each session, ranging from 66 to 110 POAPs monthly per psychologist. This enhances Celo's on-chain activity with low-cost but impactful engagements, driving further network visibility and user retention.Community Onboarding to Web3: Through our platform, we are onboarding psychologists onto the Celo network, familiarizing them with Valora wallets, transacting in stablecoins, and participating in decentralized applications. This cultivates a new user base actively engaging with the Celo ecosystem.Building Real-World Solutions: By offering decentralized mental health services and educational courses, we contribute to Celo's mission of fostering prosperity. Our measurable goals include scaling transaction volume, user engagement, and educational uptake, driving a steady stream of network activity and tangible value.Summary: Potential Monthly Transaction Volume (per psychologist): $1,650 - $2,750 USD, encompassing therapy payments and course certifications. POAPs Distributed: Up to 110 per psychologist monthly, contributing to on-chain engagement metrics.","Onboarding Psychologists into the Celo Network: Funds will be used to train and support psychologists in setting up Valora wallets and transacting on the Celo network. This includes educational workshops, one-on-one onboarding support, and creating resources to ensure smooth wallet integration and payment processing for therapy sessions. 2. Educational Content and NFT Certification: We will produce and mint NFT certificates on the Celo network to verify participation and completion of our training programs for mental health professionals. This funding will cover costs associated with minting, distributing, and promoting these certificates, strengthening Celo's presence in education and credentialing.3. Marketing and Community Engagement: We aim to raise awareness and engagement within the Celo ecosystem and broader communities through targeted marketing campaigns, events, and collaborations. This will increase adoption, transactions, and engagement with Celo’s decentralized tools along with Airdrop rewards on CELO for the most engaged professionals. 4. Operational Costs: The funding will also help cover essential operational costs such as administrative support, content creation, and communication channels, ensuring a seamless onboarding and user experience for all participants engaging with our platform.","Yes, our idea is unique. We are building the first decentralized platform that integrates psychotherapy services with Web3 tools, creating a seamless experience for both mental health professionals and their clients through the Celo ecosystem. Unlike traditional mental health platforms, we combine decentralized payments, blockchain-based credentialing, and comprehensive educational offerings tailored to onboarding psychologists into Web3.Our academy offers ongoing and live study groups, professional supervision, specialized courses, psychotherapy, governance participation, scholarships, health insurance, and access to exclusive events and talks. This holistic approach ensures that mental health professionals are continually supported, trained, and empowered to grow their practice within a decentralized framework.Our platform leverages decentralized technology to enhance transparency, accessibility, and global reach. By issuing NFT certificates on the Celo network and integrating Valora wallet transactions, we empower psychologists to offer services with secure, efficient, and inclusive payment systems. Furthermore, our model introduces a novel approach to incentivizing engagement through Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs), fostering consistent on-chain activity and strengthening community ties.In a market dominated by centralized services, our focus on decentralization, user empowerment, and community-driven governance sets us apart. By fostering real-world adoption of Celo’s blockchain, we aim to create a scalable, inclusive, and impactful mental health service ecosystem.
