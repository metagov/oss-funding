Nowadays market-oriented agriculture incentivizes low-quality short-term production. Agroforestry receives no incentives because it demands initial investment and knowledge for mid to long-term returns. However, such production is beneficial because it is less inputs intensive, sequesters a lot more carbon, cools down local temperatures, lasts for generations and keeps local communities and cultures connected with the natural succession. \n[![area-de-cima-com-colhedores.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/X7K4Zxpk/area-de-cima-com-colhedores.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9rfvKdPD)\n\nWe aim to tackle this lack of incentives by experimenting with novel ways to coordinate globally for community agriculture.

However, such production is beneficial because it is less inputs intensive, sequesters a lot more carbon, cools down local temperatures, lasts for generations and keeps local communities and cultures connected with the natural succession. \n[![area-de-cima-com-colhedores.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/X7K4Zxpk/area-de-cima-com-colhedores.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9rfvKdPD)\n\nWe aim to tackle this lack of incentives by experimenting with novel ways to coordinate globally for community agriculture. We are based in Brazil, and thanks to the support from previous Gitcoin rounds we were able to plant a pilot Food Forest (Redemption Hill, Minas Gerais) where we test different uses of web3 tools to recognize and support the agents involved, while understanding mechanisms that could help scale food forest stewardship in a descentralized way.\n\nExamples of mechanisms we have been working on:\n\n**Q1 and Q2 2024**\n- Issued **Hypercerts** for those planting the agroforest systems, as a way to link initial supporters with future production \n[![imagem-do-hypercert.png](https://i.postimg.cc/25Sv6271/imagem-do-hypercert.png)](https://postimg.cc/WdxtYmKV)\n- **Hosted students** and teachers from two schools in the region during one week to experience for the first time the harvests and maintence of a Syntropic System\n[![1estudantestodos.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/CKR1Xt4s/1estudantestodos.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/rdLMtf3D)\n\n- Deployed NFTs of agroforest consortiums ([Syntropic Nests](https://celoscan.io/token/0x1Ddd492B604304068D7f0CED933CbeaC7E70b04d)) on **Celo blockchain**. These NFTs represent Real World Assets (RWAs) and can be sold to holders as a way to monetize the service of stewardship, to facilitate joint agroforestry ventures and to allow co-ownership of future productions to NFT holders, besides other benefits such as invitation for visits and experiences in loco.    \n[![ninhos-referencia-1920x1080.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fT1gYSrW/ninhos-referencia-1920x1080.png)](https://postimg.cc/6yL0XqKF)\n👆 Above is an example of a standard for Agroforest Systems that makes it easier for global agents to follow up and invest in.\n👇 Below is an example of the NFTs deployed on Celo.

Currently, investments in these regions are predominantly made by professional investors from the US and Europe, leading to a flow of returns back to northern countries and suboptimal long-term benefits for local economies.\n\nd-fund addresses this problem by leveraging blockchain technology to democratize investment opportunities. By breaking down traditional investment products into smaller, more accessible entry tickets, we enable local individuals to invest in their markets, fostering economic inclusion. Yes, this helps investors take part in the development of their markets, but more profoundly, it allows for the funding of impactful projects throughout emerging markets that respond to local problematics.\n\nThese projects are identified by local accelerators and community leaders who have a deep understanding of the specific advantages and benefits of each project. This grassroots approach ensures that the initiatives funded are not only relevant but also effective in addressing the unique challenges faced by these communities.\n\nThrough this innovative approach, d-fund not only empowers individuals in emerging markets to become active participants in their economic futures but also promotes a more equitable global investment landscape, bridging the gap between northern and southern countries while solving local issues and driving sustainable development.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"### How Our Project Contributes to the Celo Ecosystem\n\nOur project will significantly enhance the Celo ecosystem through various strategic contributions:\n\n1. **Features Development**:\n   In the short term, we will develop basic yet essential features by tokenizing real-world assets, making them more liquid and overcoming geographical barriers. In the longer term, we aim to implement decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and incentive tokens to engage individuals in their local economies, thus fostering deeper community involvement and governance within the Celo ecosystem.\n\n2. **Legal Framework**:\n   One of our primary challenges is establishing a robust legal framework. We are conducting an extensive legal analysis to navigate the complexities of token creation, distribution, and international payments. By addressing these regulatory hurdles, we are not only ensuring compliance but also setting a precedent for other projects within the ecosystem. This investment in legal infrastructure will help stabilize and legitimize the broader use of blockchain technology in emerging markets.\n\n3. **Pragmatic Use of Blockchain**:\n   For us, blockchain is a means to achieve our mission, not the end goal. We are focused on delivering a tangible business case that utilizes blockchain as a tool for positive impact, unlike many projects that ride the blockchain wave without substantive value. Our approach highlights the practical benefits of blockchain technology, reinforcing its credibility and usefulness within the Celo ecosystem.\n\n4. **Scalability and Market Focus**:\n   We are targeting emerging markets that are poised for significant growth both industrially and demographically. Initially focusing on the African market for equity investments, we recognize the immense potential across various other markets and investment products. This expansion will drive increased transaction volumes on the Celo platform, boosting its scalability and community engagement. By tapping into these booming markets, we contribute to the creation of a robust economic fabric that aligns with Celo's vision of financial inclusion and sustainable growth.\n\n5. **Alignment with Celo's Core Values**:\n   - **Smartphone Utilization**: Celo's technology is optimized for smartphone use, a perfect match for the African market where mobile phones are integral to daily life. With the widespread use of mobile money services like M-Pesa, our project leverages this mobile-centric culture to enable seamless investment opportunities, facilitating financial inclusion and empowering individuals to participate in their market's growth directly from their mobile devices.\n   - **Carbon Targets**: One of Celo's motivations is to support carbon capture through funding positive social and environmental projects. Our project shares this commitment by focusing on investments in initiatives that address local environmental challenges. By funding impact projects identified by local accelerators and community leaders, we ensure that the investments contribute to carbon reduction and promote sustainable development, resonating with Celo's environmental goals.\n   - **Zero Knowledge Base**: Similar to Celo's vision, we believe that blockchain should be an enabler rather than a barrier. Our approach emphasizes the usability of our platform without requiring users to be blockchain experts. This aligns with Celo’s mission to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone, thereby supporting economic development in emerging markets. By simplifying the investment process and making it intuitive, we lower the entry barriers and encourage broader participation in the digital economy.\n\nThrough these shared values and strategic alignments, our project not only complements the Celo ecosystem but also amplifies its mission of financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, and technological accessibility. Together, we can drive significant social and economic impact in emerging markets, fostering a more inclusive and equitable global economy.\n","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0xf56f76bf90682d6285702492666b937e2ae3cbcb480032ca8f8e6580fe3ad9c4","title":"d-Fund","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreihs2zr2nlopop3fjyworcm5gkfwdn6m2cv6io4zhj7u4mf7mjoqdi","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://d-fund.co/","createdAt":1722256060777,"credentials":{},"description":"d-fund aims to create an investment platform allowing individuals from emerging markets to invest in their own markets.

Traditional methods for producing and trading green assets often lead to issues with quality and reliability, reducing trust and effectiveness.

Specifically, the platform aims to offer:\n1. **Support for Diverse Green Assets**: The number of green crypto-assets has been constantly growing over the last years. On the Regen Atlas, users have access to a broad spectrum of green crypto-assets (and soon corresponding stakeholders) that go beyond just carbon assets, including but not limited to biodiversity, agriculture, green and blue bonds, and forwards contracts. \n2. **Aggregated Certifications**: The platform will compile and display ratings from specialized certifiers, offering users a centralized resource for assessing the quality and potential impact of various environmental projects. Aggregation will empower users with the information necessary to make informed decisions around green assets.\n3. **Top-down Territorial Incentives**: As a geo-interface, the Regen Atlas plans to allow users to create and publish incentives tied to specific geographic locations, developing natural capital in the most impactful areas\n4. **Support for Existing Green Assets**: In the future, the platform will enable the tokenization of existing green assets on the blockchain, making them more accessible and tradable. \n[See our initial proposal on the Celo Forum](https://forum.celo.org/t/draft-celo-public-goods-the-regen-atlas-louise-borreani/7738)\n\n## What has been done since the last round ✅ 💪\n\nSince our last update, the Regen Atlas has [spinned out of Ecofrontiers](https://mirror.xyz/ecofrontiers.eth/O-xRxzyzAd-z2ST4gXvfcfqDGdG6dG9pc1xV1tlfDOA), the team has expanded, and made significant progress on the [Regen Atlas prototype v2](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/), evolving it into a more refined and user-friendly version. We’re just a few weeks away from releasing our Prototype v3, which includes a major update to our database, as well as a brand new UI and interface design. Other key updates include:\n\n1. **Team Expansion**: The Regen Atlas now counts five members working together for the future of green finance.\n2. **Enhanced Design and UI**: The interface of prototype v2 has been overhauled for better usability and aesthetic appeal. There’s now a new feature to filter assets by chain.\n3. **Database Expansion**: Our asset database has seen substantial growth, now boasting over 109 assets from 18 different providers, compared to the initial 26 assets from 8 providers of prototype v1. Since our last update, we’ve been focusing on adding asset issuers from the Celo ecosystem. We’re receiving new listing demands every week.\n4. **New logo**: We worked with a designer to create our new logo and visual identity.\n5. **New Partnerships**: The Regen Atlas is joining forces with LandX to list all of their farms producing xTokens. Learn more about this partnership [here](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas/regen-atlas-partners-with-landx)\n6. **Speaking at EthCC[7]**: The Regen Atlas’ team was in Brussels this year, attending and speaking at some key events, from the main conference to the Regen Village, or the Blockchain For Good Unconference. (Re)watch our EthCC talk [here](https://ethcc.io/archive/The-Regen-Atlas-Green-RWA-Tokenization)\n\n## Outputs 🧑‍💻\n\nA lot is happening lately, and the Regen Atlas team is planning some major releases (prototype v3 enabling direct buying of Celo assets directly on the interface is almost out of the door, we’re doing some serious MVP planning, lots of listings in the pipeline…). Contributions to this GG21 will directly support those major milestones ahead.\n\nGrant work will result in the following concrete outputs, from most to less likely depending on donations:\n\n* Add additional green assets and providers to the database.\n* Launch the v3 UI, which includes Certifiers: a special stakeholder group in green assets that evaluate the quality of the assets, and enables **direct buying of assets on Celo**.\n* Secure and complete additional partnerships like the recent [LandX one](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas/regen-atlas-partners-with-landx)\n* Pay for a part-time communication / growth manager to develop the Atlas’ listings, including upcoming listings for Certifiers.\n* Deployment of an MVP by EoY that can support up to 100k assets simultaneously.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the funding already received by the Regen Atlas:\n\n1. GG20–2,590.71 USD\n2. Celo Prezenti Grant–10,000 USD\n3. Celo RetroPGF–1,1444 USD\n\n## Resources 📚\n\n🖥️ [GitHub](https://github.com/Regen-Atlas/Regen-Atlas/tree/main)\n🌐 [Website](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/)\n✒️ [Blog](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas)\n🐦 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theregenatlas)\n\n## We thank you for your generosity! 🙏","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"Regen-Atlas","projectTwitter":"theregenatlas"},"recipient":"0x1f9266512F4B0044ca62B6f8Deb9DA4480D404E8"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreia3q6rh5dxqzofh7ljyoeie7icrvaphsbvmrzber7bojhbiiyolbq","projects":[{"name":"Regen Atlas 🌍","id":"0x364fd8491204eada86e2072c12c8b9bcbfbdee617a076c825798761d5f068e70","metadata":{"title":"Regen Atlas 🌍","logoImg":"bafkreih3m56ewbrrazri64aeam6yokjtsgutedd4wn6teyv34hsedanwsi","website":"https://www.regenatlas.xyz","bannerImg":"bafkreicrhwdnr33usc5qu7nsi5yqfommf32kesxeew6dyrk2skpgmcfoua","createdAt":1722258018546,"userGithub":"unjoursurterre","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..rhtb1fhZrMLieEXd_Jc5nbPLgL9P0lz0L6IaC0ZFeEt13MoxsARUsg_T1kIvx8FKNTPP2EEj5LDfZulpkKvgDw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-07-29T12:59:56.482Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-07-29T12:59:56.482Z","expirationDate":"2024-10-27T12:59:56.482Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x9D235B00Bb8BDA7c9c027D3d707004C75e24A83a","hash":"v0.0.0:tNzQ1f0O5Eu41aRm5iXP6FG6bz87Vw6Il1GehGce0x0=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#Regen-Atlas#121888406"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..4-CmHS9wmCGblSpcmnW7zucuX3OXlCdbIUqDbUkr4aNyddrtnLMkc6ht81ZPUmYcazDCHETjHpDBcmzihziFCQ","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-07-29T12:57:02.726Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-07-29T12:57:02.726Z","expirationDate":"2024-10-27T12:57:02.726Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x9D235B00Bb8BDA7c9c027D3d707004C75e24A83a","hash":"v0.0.0:9+3bGUVsFF7peyGsH6y8EqsX2q7E2hJH2xK1+Id50/k=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#theregenatlas"}}},"description":"Let’s make **ReFi organizations as visible and impactful as the green assets they support.** 🚀 \n\n#### **Project Overview**  \n\nRegen Atlas is a **green crypto-asset aggregator**, unifying all major **ReFi assets and issuers** in one interface. Our goal is to simplify access to climate-positive Web3 assets, making it easier for users to discover, compare, and trade **high-impact ReFi assets**.  \n\nNow, we are **expanding beyond assets and issuers**—our next major feature is an **Orgs Filter**, which will allow users to explore **ReFi organizations (ReFi Local Nodes, the GreenPill Chapters, Celo Regional DAOs, etc)** that are actively driving regenerative finance adoption worldwide.  \n\n[View prototype version of the Org Filter](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/orgs)\n\n[View project on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/regen-atlas-)\n\n## 🧑‍💻 Roadmap & Future Plans\n\nWith your support, Regen Atlas will achieve the following milestones:\n\n- 🏫 **Higher Fidelity Org Pages** – We aim to dramatically improve the Orgs panel to provide a comprehensive aggregation service for Orgs in the Regenerative Finance ecosystem.\n- 📌 **Taxonomy Update** – We are already working on a new asset classification that we aim to finish soon. This updated classification streamlines the current taxonomy to be more intuitive and aligned with the evolving industry of impact reporting.\n- 📊 **Market Cap Dashboard** – Work has been started to provide users with real-time insights into market statistics based on the updated taxonomy, and shall continue thanks to your support.  With this, we’ll be able to track the growth of the ReFi sector.\n- ➕ **More Assets & Providers** – Continuously adding verified projects to the database.\n\nBut most importantly, we have started the development of an [Orgs Filter](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/orgs) that aims to:  \n\n1. **Bridging the gap between asset buyers and local ReFi communities**  \n   - Today, Regen Atlas users can **purchase green assets**, but they have no direct way to **engage with the organizations building the ReFi movement** in their regions.  \n   - The **Orgs Filter** will change this—users connecting to Regen Atlas will be able to **discover local ReFi communities**.\n\n2. **Increasing visibility and funding for ReFi builders**  \n   - Many ReFi organizations operate at the grassroots level and struggle to gain visibility.  \n   - Our new filter will ensure **ReFi DAO Chapters, the GreenPill Network, Celo Regional DAOs, etc.** are as discoverable as the green assets they help enable.  \n   - This will **drive participation and funding to organizations that are educating, onboarding, and scaling ReFi adoption globally**.   \n\n## 📚 Resources\n\n🔗 **[GitHub](https://github.com/Regen-Atlas)**  \n🌐 **[Website](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/)**\n📄 **[Docs](https://regen-atlas.gitbook.io/regen-atlas-docs)**  \n✒️ **[Blog](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas)**  \n🐦 **[X](https://x.com/theregenatlas)**  \n\nWe deeply appreciate your generosity and support! 🙏 \n\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Regen-Atlas","projectTwitter":"theregenatlas"},"metadataCid":"bafkreiab5asmrell2gf35sunlsnbfcug4nug4gclw2gh5rk2lk7wrlird4","timestamp":"2024-07-29T13:00:54+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x82365154E75380E1679383377f649863643063c3","createdAtBlock":26917220}],"projectId":"0x364fd8491204eada86e2072c12c8b9bcbfbdee617a076c825798761d5f068e70","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"11","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-07-29T13:06:29.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26917287"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2024-07-29T13:53:09.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26917847"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-07-29T13:06:29+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":434.02441,"totalDonationsCount":62,"uniqueDonorsCount":59},{"anchorAddress":"0xF32Ed2625E7AB5b5345769973641340215519875","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27095210,"createdByAddress":"0x7AbA135f55e9b60D4C14275FDE03e3a4d23FcadA","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"82","metadata":{"signature":"0xd2f4e28cb3bc52511b4b23c2565eb3f07d12e79dfb9c26241e48821b4d138eb212cdc087d5976a39e92148fb6dbaaca14275d5ae6d2ba52d29bea60ed14556791b","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"sNuf5Or0l/UuRMlJom76MF83Y9/6Ikmo7BXa0lAE+XrpJ2y2Mhu1w2Bp/y2k4OZt","encryptedSymmetricKey":"cead557530c08ed0b364846ac44384897a7ff6bbce2157856b41ba1b858245400160188c9f0d80990e29eb9ff75c9412fcfd3f8cf2e9f5c550f71a435c4b0a71a0be70d8b308b93ca7b4a64d1c5ed94c48e711222490fa5227775035b86cc68c733e9171bfc90225e17b2d8f6889875a48ca987c31bcc71c1a5b8abb5724f4fe0000000000000020a03fec9b0cb81b0de8e0629ec2b0d5cceb812358ab5b8218ee56b855b41f276014c72f3ac7befe9f99691a97c5a1df98"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Grants and local contributions","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"3","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":" To raise funds and awareness for the local unhoused community by merging Web2 and Web3 technologies, engaging the community through art, music, and family-friendly activities.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"1.

It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n![image](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)\nFig 1. A map of the Mesoamerican Reef, © WWF Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\nMesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).\n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252F5iB319gFA87fE0i4ImEU%252FMesoReefDAO%2520Framework%2520Conservation.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db2a6e496-8306-4f57-8681-2838fa04713c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c5acf856&sv=1)\nFig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerate coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n\n**When?**\n\n\n*2024-2030*\n\n\n- Develop a Web2+Web3 Interface\n- Expansion and Onboarding Efforts\n- Exploration of Web3 DAO Tools\n- Collaboration Partnerships and Initiatives\n- Research and Development Initiatives (i.e., Tokenomics, Biodiversity Credits)\n- Community Engagement and Transparency\n- Continuous Improvement and Adaptation\n- Pilot Programs and Proof of Concept: RegenReef (Fig. 4-5):\n\n\n   1. - Biobank of corals\n   2. - Coral and Fish Nursery\n   3. - Micropropagation Zone\n   4. - Disease and Bleaching Research Unit\n   5. - DeSci Web3 Collaboration Hub\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJoksYFXgAAqMf-?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nFig 4.

It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n![image](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)\nFig 1. A map of the Mesoamerican Reef, © WWF Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\nMesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).\n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252F5iB319gFA87fE0i4ImEU%252FMesoReefDAO%2520Framework%2520Conservation.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db2a6e496-8306-4f57-8681-2838fa04713c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c5acf856&sv=1)\nFig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerating coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n\n**When?**\n\n\n*2024-2030*\n\n\n- Develop a Web2+Web3 Interface\n- Expansion and Onboarding Efforts\n- Exploration of Web3 DAO Tools\n- Collaboration Partnerships and Initiatives\n- Research and Development Initiatives (i.e., Tokenomics, Biodiversity Credits)\n- Community Engagement and Transparency\n- Continuous Improvement and Adaptation\n- Pilot Programs and Proof of Concept: RegenReef (Fig. 4-5):\n\n\n   1. - Biobank of corals\n   2. - Coral and Fish Nursery\n   3. - Micropropagation Zone\n   4. - Disease and Bleaching Research Unit\n   5. - DeSci Web3 Collaboration Hub\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJoksYFXgAAqMf-?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nFig 4.

We’ve catalyzed a growing movement around regenerative finance (ReFi) and community-based coordination. Now, we enter a new phase.\n\nIn 2025, our core focus is **consolidating the infrastructure for decentralized coordination**. This proposal is part of a broader, interconnected effort to strengthen the systems that will sustain and scale regenerative action.\n\n### Cookie Jar Coordination Layer on Celo\n\n[![Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vHC52kwW/Captura-de-tela-de-2025-04-02-02-22-21.png)](https://postimg.cc/4mbKm8dd)\n\nWe are co-developing a coordination mechanism using [Cookie Jar](https://github.com/HoomanDigital/cookie-jar/blob/main/contract/cookie%20jar-withblacklist.sol) contracts [deployed on the Celo blockchain](https://celo-alfajores.blockscout.com/address/0xD54799973e5e8f468A6DF910C53514aeDF9D4868?tab=logs). This is work is part of a collaborative [research model proposal within the **Allo Capital** community](https://research.allo.capital/t/decentralized-research-funding-using-cookie-jar/122), and a collaboration between the **Greenpill Dev Guild** and **Celo Europe**. It aims to bring **transparent micro-granting infrastructure** to our community, using ERC-20 compatible tokens like cREAL.\n\nWe’re currently exploring and implementing two Cookie Jars:\n- One for the **GreenPill Brasil Council** (our main governance body).\n- One for the **Guardians** (our distributed community stewards).\n\nThese Jars will serve as onchain grant pools that reward verified regenerative contributions, reinforce autonomy in coordination, and support distributed decision-making.\n\n### Climate Megazord Coordination via Gardens\n\nIn parallel, we are consolidating our [Climate Megazord](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGYTqqLdlA/5iEk5mpI4k1jAkVh2NhxsA/view?utm_content=DAGYTqqLdlA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h6f2da95b9b) as our long-term climate resilience protocol. It follows three pillars:\n- **Prediction** (early signals and local climate data).\n- **Adaptation** (community infrastructure and preparedness).\n- **Response** (coordinated action during disasters).\n\nGovernance and resource allocation for this protocol is coordinated via [Gardens v2](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/137/0x6fac69b92b1943da2a8ff99e3687451f10066018/0x65bf57a410ed5fa69669f307c2da65eae06279f4), using signaling and conviction voting mechanisms.\n\n### Glocalism Collaboration\n\nOur alliances span from local agroecology task forces (e.g. SAF do Futuro, Morro da Redenção) to the global Ethereum Localism movement and ecosystem allies like Celo and Gitcoin. GreenPill Brasil is committed to being a bridge between grassroots regeneration and resilient coordination tech.\n---\n## How the Funds Will Be Used\n\nThis new phase is about **laying the groundwork for long-term regeneration** by creating the digital infrastructure that empowers communities, codifies trust, and fuels decentralized action.\n\nThe requested funds for this cycle will be focused on:\n- **Deploying and operationalizing two Cookie Jars** for internal micro-funding coordination (Council & Guardians).\n- **Coordinating and documenting the Climate Megazord infrastructure**, including governance cycles on Gardens.\n- **Sustaining direct funding for grassroots regen activities** via [Charmverse proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpillbrasil/proposals) under our Regen Incentives campaign.\n- **Scale our onboarding and funding processes** to support more projects and regional nodes.\n- **Refine our decentralized protocols**, integrating tools like [Impact Miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=pt_BR&pli=1), and the evolving [GreenGoods app](https://greengoods.app) (with new in-app plant ID features).\n- **Expand partnerships** with AgroforestDAO, Fabulosa Lab, Celo Public Goods, Celo Europe, and others to co-create more inclusive and impactful regenerative ecosystems.\n---\n## **Join Us in Building a Future**\n\nGreenPill Brasil is not just a project—it’s a movement. Your support will help us build a infrastructure that scales trust, amplifies grassroots agency, and coordinates regenerative action across Brazil and beyond.\n\n[telegram](https://t.me/+6GlufLobfMRiMTIx)\n\n**Let’s regenerate, one step at a time.** \n\n[![Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/90LYfY0C/Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/kRtb18Wp)\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"greenpillbrasil"},"metadataCid":"bafkreidrlvhpvapuueam6tpkzemfxzggfzgwuecsdjls4uxssfs7pg444e","timestamp":"2024-03-20T07:03:12+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x8C180840fcBb90CE8464B4eCd12ab0f840c6647C","createdAtBlock":192256554},{"name":"GreenPill Brasil - GG21","id":"0x7e215e52873adcf476ab86f5f66282a87740c8a90fde4991cbeec376530ef242","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-03T01:36:36+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x53b00300EFF94D750b4893CCA4Ef23Ba9F14eE18","createdAtBlock":26995400}],"projectId":"0x7e215e52873adcf476ab86f5f66282a87740c8a90fde4991cbeec376530ef242","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":3}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-03T01:36:51.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26995403"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T10:13:34.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27036157"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-03T01:36:51+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x48Ade3231C221B838aD70Ff294fa8aD3c701d28a","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":26926520,"createdByAddress":"0x801c43Ebe0764d2916aEfd70D32720385Bb1f636","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"11","metadata":{"signature":"0xe4396ce47d4cdc544d976ea847cf9e997450526ede818cc1fad291e037287d467f59c05b76cc585f24c7ab8c9dbe1b73384d39ebf4362be0f203a7085a4bfd951c","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"KnmRnhlYfoOYWTx8gBfDzMYh5Nixcr6TRj9VweKWnBFAoW2Sj72iqyhFksbVgzVq","encryptedSymmetricKey":"e6d81c28b30480206624bca3ea83a10bf2b2e9252b20b8ded9aade14c3aa168c7f039e69fc8e142201797f233c3fe7195efea3c11969e7e3abd9f20f2a9e9cb35e3697896c2b65b25e7a41be9a1f5067ff6e0c1189c2691d7cc94a06cdf41eaaf379606ecfde0e73eaa280366608bdcb7599a6a81f37649241ffceca106c98e500000000000000201bc441e784cbad4994c850015c347e61fcf45c95f95976c45dc42784dc95cce8710c2d4ed59fb838bf5d0df9537d7893"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"None","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"2","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Travelers of color struggle to find safe, welcoming, and culturally inclusive accommodations while exploring the world.

The DApp allows users to create and join campaigns, contribute funds, and track campaign details transparently on the blockchain.\n\nSupported Assets: Celo, cUSD, G$\n\nEsusu is a 3 in 1 solution to solving issues related to financial inclusion and poor savings trend. the sections are\n\n    Esusu thrift contribution: 5 users join a contribution campaign where they pool their funds every month for 5 months. For every month a unique user takes home the total contribution giving everyone access to bulk money which naturally they couldn't have saved up. This also eliminates the need to borrow money to fund big projects.\n\n    Esusu piggy box: Funds are locked up over time so that users no longer have access to them. They earn EST tokens for locking up funds but lose these tokens if they decide to break the lock.\n\n    Esusu pay bills: Users can pay for their utility and also make donations to their various projects\n\nProblem:\nAcross developing economies, particularly in Africa, financial exclusion persists due to limited banking access and a weakening savings culture exacerbated by economic pressures and increased impulse spending. Traditional community savings systems like Esusu face trust and efficiency challenges, while formal banking remains inaccessible to many. This creates a critical need for secure, transparent financial tools that combine the community strength of traditional systems with modern technological safeguards, enabling financial discipline and capital formation in underserved populations.\n\nSolution:\nESUSU is a blockchain-based financial inclusion platform that addresses key financial challenges in developing economies. It modernizes traditional African community savings through three integrated solutions: a Thrift Contribution System enabling group savings and rotating payouts, a MiniSafe Box for time-locked personal savings with token rewards, and a Bill Payment System for low-cost utility payments and donations. Built on the Celo blockchain, ESUSU leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility via mobile devices with minimal bandwidth requirements.

Climate change, loss of biodiversity, and pollution are exacerbated by companies that fail to integrate sustainable practices into their operations. Traditional business models often prioritize short-term profits over long-term ecological health, leading to severe consequences for our planet and its inhabitants.\n\n**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Complexity**\n\nIntegrating ESG practices into business operations and supply chains is complex, time-consuming, and costly, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Many businesses lack the resources and expertise to effectively measure and improve their environmental and social impact, resulting in missed opportunities for contributing to a sustainable future.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Drivyx Platform**\n\nDrivyx addresses these critical issues by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that democratizes ESG practices, making them accessible and manageable for businesses of all sizes. Our platform integrates blockchain technology and AI to offer tools and resources that simplify sustainable business practices, enhance transparency in ESG reporting, and provide verifiable impact.\n\n**Impact Measurement and Insetting Activities**\n\nDrivyx enables businesses to participate in insetting activities—initiatives that reduce a company's carbon footprint within its own supply chain. By offering challenges and community-driven initiatives, businesses can actively engage in sustainable practices and measure their impact in real-time. Our AI-powered agent, Vytal, guides users through every step of their ESG journey, ensuring seamless integration into their business strategies.\n\n### Real World Impact\n\n**Financial Inclusion and Ecological Credits**\n\nDrivyx supports financial inclusion by providing a platform where businesses can access funding opportunities and ecological credits.

A Collaborative Regen Ecosystem 🤝**\n\n*Media Partnerships and Regen Alliances:* Regenerative development requires collaboration over competition, so we’re brewing an alliance of community-building initiatives across the web3 ecosystem.

If we want to build regenerative systems and address the climate crisis effectively, we need everyone involved in the solution design process.\n\nWe are evolving the web3 space by:\n\n- **Bringing in expertise** from sectors outside of web3 to broaden the regen movement\n- Providing an avenue for innovative web3 projects to conduct research and receive **rapid feedback** outside of their bubble\n- Designing events with high-quality interaction, and safe spaces for experimentation to **co-create web3 projects with local regens.**\n- **Driving inclusivity and diversity in web3** through curated attendance, using application processes & scholarships\n- **Creating toolkits and media** to elevate project stories, educate on the regen movement, and inspire new groups to get involved\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-14 at 8.36.29 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WnhShlC.png)\n\n\n---\n\n\n![Where we're going.svg](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F668b2193-8cb7-4aaa-834b-1fdd24fe4a81%2FWhere_were_going.svg?table=block&id=b7dc65be-6e9e-4256-9dda-66428992dcb9&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nRegens Unite was born in May 2022 with a seed event in Brussels. Since then we have initiated **18 events** in different locations, grown a **Telegram group of 700+ regens**, and formed **a small, distributed team** passionate about advancing a regenerative future.\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of requests from event organizers across the world to grow the movement, and we are continuing to build a platform to connect regens with learnings, resources, and mutual support.\n\n**Thank you in advance for your support.

Educational Media and Storytelling Platform 🎥**\n\n**Recorded Content**: we are publishing recorded event sessions from our digital webinars, 1-1 project interviews, and after-movies from our last events.\n\n**Community Showcase**: A discovery hub for ReFi and climate-focused communities in Web3. The next version will spotlight impactful projects, useful tools, supportive networks, onboarding resources, and key builders.\n\n# **3. A Collaborative Regen Ecosystem 🤝**\n\n**Toolkits for Event Organizers:** We’ll support organizers to host events under or with Regens Unite branding, as a response to ongoing interest in gatherings focused on ReFi, Web3, climate, activism, art, and more.\n\n**Media Partnerships and Regen Alliances:** Regenerative development requires collaboration over competition, so we’re brewing an alliance of community-building initiatives across the web3 ecosystem. We are also organically expanding our impact and reach through aligned storytelling partnerships.\n\n---\n\n![](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F03e3e609-0541-48a4-9976-280b7e65b737%2FWhat_Regens_Unite_is_bringing_to_web3.svg?table=block&id=caf641bc-7377-465b-9c3d-9421562d02be&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 needs more diversity and more expertise to achieve true systems change at a global scale. If we want to build regenerative systems and address the climate crisis effectively, we need everyone involved in the solution design process.\n\nWe are evolving the web3 space by:\n\n- **Bringing in expertise** from sectors outside of web3 to broaden the regen movement\n- Providing an avenue for innovative web3 projects to conduct research and receive **rapid feedback** outside of their bubble\n- Designing events with high-quality interaction, and safe spaces for experimentation to **co-create web3 projects with local regens.**\n- **Driving inclusivity and diversity in web3** through curated attendance, using application processes & scholarships\n- **Creating toolkits and media** to elevate project stories, educate on the regen movement, and inspire new groups to get involved\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WnhShlC.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F668b2193-8cb7-4aaa-834b-1fdd24fe4a81%2FWhere_were_going.svg?table=block&id=b7dc65be-6e9e-4256-9dda-66428992dcb9&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of requests from event organizers across the world to grow the movement, and we are continuing to build a platform to connect regens with learnings, resources, and mutual support.\n\n**Thank you in advance for your support.

These credits serve as a tangible measure of our impact in mitigating plastic pollution and promoting environmental stewardship.\n\n![plasticcredits gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkkdWwhxC.png)\n- To date we have reported 1,088 kilos of plastic sequestered and removed from the environment which has been recorded on the empower.eco blockchain. According to conservative methods to estimate GHG emissions, this would equate to 1,632 kg of CO2 equivalent or 1.5 kg of C02 for  each kilogram of plastic removed from the environment.\n\n\n**Milestones Achieved in Tulum:** \n\nWe achieved several milestones in Tulum during Q1, including:\n1. Proving out our incentives and token rewards model through community engagement activities that resulted in sufficient tokens to purchase a ticket to the Day Zero Festival in Tulum.\n2. Partnering with Bye Bye Plastic for a beach cleanup of Unesco World Heritage site Sian Kaan, resulting in the removal of 357 kilos of plastic. \n![fullcleanup byebye gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJhbtvnx0.jpg)\n\n3. Planting 50 trees as part of the Tulum’s Reforestation Campaign 2024, contributing to the greening of our community.\n![geraplantinggg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryNDOP3xR.jpg)\n\n4. Hosting self-organized events at Tulum Circula to catalyze the community and support infrastructure needs. \n![stephcrates](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJl5BP2gA.jpg)\n\n5. Participating in various events in Tulum and globally to advocate for ReFi Initiatives such as BitBasel and Regen Week.\n6. Continued weekly educational events hosted at the NFT Boutique on ReFi topics \n\n\n**Challenges Faced:**\nEarly in our acquisition process of the TF100 technology, it became evident that the existing technology did not meet our environmental or operational standards.  We have worked with several different design engineers and settled on a modification that will both create a closed system for plastic re-molding and reduce operator exposure. The following modifications are currently underway that can achieve both goals:\n![TF100mods gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJb9iDhl0.jpg)\n\n\n* Modification of the plastic foundry to operate with a furnace and plastic flakes.\n* Implementation of safety measures to protect operators.\n* Manipulation of molds using rails to reduce contact with plastic.\n* Installation of a mold base and a 4-inch extractor to prevent smoke dispersion.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- We have learned the importance of flexibility and adaptability in navigating challenges and as eager as we were to start making new products from the TF100, we realized it would not be the right path forward. \n- Building strong partnerships and collaborations is key to amplifying our impact and achieving meaningful outcomes in our initiatives.\n\n**Utilization of Additional Funding:**\nThe additional funding from the upcoming round will be instrumental in:\n*  Scaling our plastic neutrality and eMobility initiatives to reach a broader audience and deepen our impact.\n* Complete modifications to the TF100 machine to optimize its performance and increase efficiency in plastic sequestration.\n* Hire a dedicated operator to work regularly with the TF100 machine, ensuring consistent operation and maximizing plastic sequestration efforts.\n* Strengthening our team and expanding our network of collaborators to sustain momentum and drive further innovation..\n* Invest in business development activities to forge partnerships and collaborations that will further advance our mission and expand our reach.\n* Continue to maintain and improve our fleet of ReFi Rides, ensuring reliable and sustainable transportation options for the community while reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\n![sunset tulum

Our agency curates mementos of the performances and mints them on NFT marketplaces to memorialize the occasion and provide income for the entertainers.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"_danc3"},"metadataCid":"bafkreib3j7b5ffk45zlcwxsrvtgchylrhbfzbhrkvwwbtu2enct4kwt3c4","timestamp":"2024-07-24T22:30:39+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x4Da2d658eC798Af7e723069dedEEA27BC7F8Ba52","createdAtBlock":26837672}],"projectId":"0x35ae64a74334a98cb4db6f200e42c065e12fef2162789ed42f86987bf43e7455","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"11","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-07-24T22:40:59.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26837796"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2024-07-29T13:57:09.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26917895"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-07-24T22:40:59+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":8.18106,"totalDonationsCount":14,"uniqueDonorsCount":12},{"anchorAddress":"0xA2B6AcF395cE31A7F10c6d3865000338Ca718072","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27059373,"createdByAddress":"0x9DCbA70B2dfe5807e2A847E065EBb666791F8b8A","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"56","metadata":{"signature":"0xe421d52a26d9d428edc1616bac6ace06c554c810ee007965c11fc84627f2b8f725e5f810a091766e19624060eef8ca6a44c7a4d3116881ea859b443f798c0fd61c","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"yu93TjTHZ//H0iRw/GaeOrbc4idNWqHVO95F6slWXLAYRePdmoFRCBwg8J2WCyZw","encryptedSymmetricKey":"9483c84ce0f5745a0a09cdb031dcafb9da815be2020762b4eda06a79e1079ee51283cf01c5ad5ef0699e038181c1ec0d19bbb62dcea83e89d76c51edabf0a392e3e210d54fd7462c8452a92ac2d4a254f1806eeb8ee726db7ce775665f990b8cf2389a18f6d6949d3972a272e5ffa365a5887367ce229d834aba4bd66defd2e10000000000000020bcbfcc37dfb8623a388cacbbaf5bba913337d2471783319c563040517608ceb89503741df48f5742c591f4f1c419b1b7"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Grants ","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"9","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"1.

It is responsible for around **40% of global carbon emissions, 30% of waste generation, and 20% of water consumption**. These emissions arise from materials like cement, steel, and aluminium used in construction, as well as energy consumption for heating, cooling, and lighting in buildings and infrastructure.

Below are the identified issues that need to be addressed for a industry wide transformation -\n\n\n1. Misaligned incentives for stakeholders to invest on improved building efficiency.\n2. Lack of innovative financial models to fund solutions.\n4. The return on investment is not always lucrative enough.\n5. Challenging to coordinate with stakeholders to align on goals and solutions.\n6. No standard, versatile BIM-based, digital-first system to evaluate a building’s performance efficiently and cost-effectively.\n7.

The dMRV infrastrucuture being open source solves data interoperability problems in BIM(Building Information Modeling) faced by architects, engineers and other stakeholders in the construction industry. This enables more experts to perform environmental related analysis in a much easier and faster way than what is currently possible.\n3. Internal feedback loops to incentivise and reward regenerative actions leads to systemic adoption across the world, resulting in more climate positive behaviours like reducing GHG emissions, water savings, eco friendly materials, improved biodiversity and human health, etc.\n4.

We have been working on all three fronts with most progress made in research and consensus building so far.\n\n1. Research on Framework - Progress made on the regenerative  framework for the built environment will be applied by practitioners around the world on real world projects, resulting in more projects having regenerative impact.\n\n2. Consensus Building - Build Environment Regeneration Network (BERN) connects and aligns siloed people and groups to build consensus for future collaborations. Open sharing of information and building culture accelerates the progress and improves chances of success over the long term. Examples of aligned groups include - Urban Regenerators, A Regenerative Place, Regen Tribes, Regeneracity\n\n\n3.

However, as our strategy evolved, we recognized that a mentorship-driven approach would more effectively achieve our desired outcomes. Consequently, we shifted our focus towards developing a comprehensive Mentorship Program that emphasizes the matchmaking of climate projects and advocates with token engineering experts, enhancing the practical application of token engineering principles to address environmental challenges. While quests remain a component of our program, they are now integrated as needed to support specific learning objectives within the mentorship framework.\n\nWe have successfully established various tracks in our [Mentorship Program](https://trustedseed.org/participate/mentorship-program), tailored to specific aspects of token engineering and climate solutions, and have begun identifying potential mentors from our curated network of regenerative actors. These mentors are selected for their expertise and commitment to fostering sustainable solutions within the blockchain space.\n\nOur plans for the funding from GG21 are focused on executing the remaining milestones of the Mentorship Program:\n\n- **Mentors Activation:** Completing the recruitment of experienced professionals to guide the mentees.\n- **Pilot Cohort:** Launching and running the first cohort, which includes delivering educational content, facilitating project work with Celo's tools, and conducting regular check-ins.\n- **Pilot Cohort Closing and Next Steps Planning:** Evaluating the program's effectiveness, incorporating feedback, and planning for broader implementation.\n\nIn our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, we are particularly keen on engaging participants from various regions, including Asia & Africa. This approach not only enriches our program with diverse perspectives but also aligns with our goals of promoting sustainable blockchain solutions globally.\n\nThe funding will be crucial in supporting these activities, ensuring our Mentorship Program is robustly executed and effectively scaled to reach more participants and have a greater impact on both the blockchain and climate action landscapes.\n\n**Team Diversity**\n\nTrusted Seed strives to be a diverse, equitable and inclusive community and we are proud to have members coming from **Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil, and the Philippines**, which brings different perspectives and ideas to the table.  We aim to create a respectful and safe environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and contributing to our team's goals. We celebrate our diversity and commit to continuously learning and improving our inclusivity efforts.","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"TrustedSeed"},"recipient":"0x97e5552F5Ba70FD4b6a537C2a24fC22D7278CcAf"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidqwqoe66l7de23khzz635tcz6eqqyn3xclgtn2iblsnmapwk3qam","projects":[{"name":"Trusted Seed Mentorship Program","id":"0x36cf812513d885c241562652a52dc3bfb74f0307fe27c93a6761fadc775b09cc","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-02T13:33:31+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xC5A756D63C5fe67b438acBE468aA62a52093fDEf","createdAtBlock":123503417},{"name":"Trusted Seed Mentorship Program","id":"0x36cf812513d885c241562652a52dc3bfb74f0307fe27c93a6761fadc775b09cc","metadata":{"title":"Trusted Seed","logoImg":"bafkreibw7up4my5ohf5iui46ib6tti7sxd6wntfv2zizc4stajx4cr5r6i","website":"https://trustedseed.org/","bannerImg":"bafkreiftvwkib444l65npvpjyudjjgzvroqvkbibuzwhy3dqxfxfawphvy","createdAt":1722602936633,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..TPQk-kqJL7rAfuymEs4wpaZKjQ6Sv7q2ndRsxqiPc6DufIfZc0a0ysHGFqDFPD1izabWJqhXXEPp53mF3ax_Ag","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-02T12:39:29.556Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-02T12:39:29.556Z","expirationDate":"2024-10-31T12:39:29.556Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xC5A756D63C5fe67b438acBE468aA62a52093fDEf","hash":"v0.0.0:bt/EXWvze6ClXFGt+ATp+MFs3kNlazrZ2GTmNcomGac=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#TrustedSeed"}}},"description":"Trusted Seed is a global network of trusted actors committed to creating regenerative economies for public goods through token engineering and DAO governance.

The problem is twofold:\n\n1. ReFi projects struggle to demonstrate and promote their impact outside of the space.\n\n2. The ReFi/Web3 impact space as a whole lacks a central source of information that can help build credibility and attract attention from outside the space. \n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution is a platform that aggregates everything happening in the ReFi/Web3 impact space, from news and events to projects and people. Importantly, the platform must bridge the gap between non-Web3 industries like climate finance and the Web3 world by speaking a language both can understand. It's why the focus needs to be on real-world impact, not technology, jargon, and complexity. \n\nA big part of this is a database of projects operating in the space. By creating a profile page for each project and connecting fundraising, impact, activity, and news data, we give projects a platform on which to build reputation and promote their work.\n\nThe database also allows us to track category- and industry-wide metrics. For example, we envision a \"ReFi Dashboard\" that can provide a snapshot of the impact ReFi projects are having at any given time. \n\nFinally, the database helps us enrich our industry reports: the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN. We aim to provide the kind of data-driven analysis expected of an industry such as ReFi.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"For the ReFi project database to become a true public good, it needs to be owned and managed by the community.  We envision an approach where projects in the DB can \"claim\" their profile by minting an NFT and paying a \"skin in the game\" fee. All revenue would go directly to the community treasury (minus a small percentage to CARBON Copy for prior work done). NFT holders will get governance rights and will be the ultimate decision-makers regarding the future of the DB and how the treasury is utilized. We will also open-source the code-base and transfer ownership to the community.\n\nWe think Celo is the ideal ecosystem for this. It's support for public goods and regenerative impact is a great example for other blockchain ecosystems to emulate. Its philosophy also aligns closely with our own: creating the conditions for prosperity.\n\nSuch an undertaking requires a multi-phased process. We would likely start with an ownership verification process and NFT mint that establishes the foundation of community ownership and treasury. Phase 2 would see integration between the NFTs and the ReFi project database, allowing NFT holders to update their project profile. In Phase 3, we would open-source the code base, transfer ownership to the community, and have the community start making decisions around the database (including paying bounties for updates). Phase 4 would be the complete separation from CARBON Copy.\n\nThis process will probably take a year to complete, so we are looking to raise the funds to complete Phase 1 over the next 3 months. \n\nThe contribution to the Celo ecosystem are centered on increasing wallet growth and transaction activity. The scale will be small to begin with, but as the database becomes an increasingly important to ReFi project reputation, we see the potential for growth in terms of NFT mints and bounty activity.

Each company has its own profile page complete with contact info, news, media coverage, content feed, token and fundraising data, and more. Each category in our taxonomy also has its own dedicated page showing aggregated data.\n\nWe are also developing a suite of educational tools to help projects expand and promote their regenerative impact. The first tool is a regenerative self-assessment survey based on a framework developed by Kate Bennett.\n\n# The ReFi Project Database\n\nOur database is a curated mapping of the Web3 regenerative finance space. We hope it will serve as a source of truth for the space and help new projects, in particular, establish an online footprint.\n\n## Features\n\nAll of the projects are accessible in one paged list:\n\n![ReFi project listing](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-list.png)\n\nEach project has its own dedicated profile page, including direct integration with Karma GAP milestones:\n\n![Project profile page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-project.jpeg)\n\nEach category in our taxonomy has its own dedicated page with aggregated data:\n\n![Category page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-category.jpg)\n\n# Other Activities\n\n**Industry Reports** - We released the 2024 editions of our cornerstone industry report, [The State of ReFi](https://carboncopy.news/reports/state-of-refi-2024/), in February in coordination with ReFi DAO and [The Impact DePIN Report](https://carboncopy.news/reports/impact-depin-2024/) in July in coordination with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network.\n\n**Regenerative Self-Assessment** - We have launched a survey based on the research of [Kate Bennett](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ktlbennett) to help ReFi/Web3 projects become more regenerative in their organisation and impact. \n\n**Articles & Interviews** - We are slowly building a team of writers that produce rich analytical articles on ReFi topics, with a specific focus on localised impact. Example: [Exploring ReFi's Potential in Nigeria](https://carboncopy.news/features/exploring-refi-potential-nigeria/)\n\n**X Spaces** - We have started to host monthly X Spaces around topics relevant to the ReFi space. We've so far discussed the GG20 Climate Round with Climate Coordination Network, the Impact DePIN Report with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network, and the launch of our project database with Pranav Khanna. \n\n**Weekly ReFi recaps** - We aggregate the news, wins, content, and thoughts from the ReFi space each week into a single article so stakeholders can stay up to do with what's happening. Example: [This Week in ReFi: July 20th-26th](https://carboncopy.news/this-week-in-refi/july-20th-26th-2024/)\n\n**ReFi News Feed** - We aggregate news from across the ReFi space into a single RSS feed that anyone can subscribe to or integrate into their projects. As the ReFi space grows, we see this as an important source of truth for crypto and tech media outlets.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nLooking forward, we are currently working on the following:\n\n## 1) Impact metric integration on project profile pages\n\nAt the heart of our mission is the desire to help ReFi projects demonstrate and promote their impact. To that end, we are working towards integrating impact data directly on the project profile and category profile pages.\n\n## 2) ReFi Dashboard\n\nWith project data integrated, it will allow us to put together an aggregated dataset of impact across the ReFi space.\n\n## 3) Nouns-style community for database management\n\nWe want the ReFi project database to remain a public good. As such, we are aiming for a community approach where decisions regarding the database are not made by us.\n\n## 4) 2025 editions of the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN reports\n\nWe aim to use this year's reports plus the data we are aggregating to produce richer, more insightful reports in 2025.\n\n## 5) Latin American and Southeast Asian content\n\nWe are looking to expand the geographic scope of our content and offer analysis from wherever ReFi is making impact.\n\n# Links\n\n**ReFi Project DB** -

Creating a wiki knowledge base\n**Objective:** Establish an open-source knowledge base that consolidates articles, tools, frameworks, protocols, companies, best practices, involved in ecological impact verification (MRV). \n**Components:**\n* Comprehensive Database: Gather and document tools, metrics, frameworks, companies, organisations, protocols, everything in the ecological impact space.\n* Best Practices Documentation: Provide detailed guidelines for various types of ecological impact verification. For example:\n    * Tree Planting Verification: Guidelines on checking the spacing of planted trees, survival rates over time, etc.\n    * Soil Health Monitoring: Methods to assess soil composition, fertility, and health post-intervention.\n    * Water Quality Assessment: Protocols for measuring changes in water quality in ecosystems.\n    * Biodiversity Surveys: Techniques for evaluating the impact on local biodiversity.\n \n**Benefits:** Create a publicly accessible resource that supports and enhances the efforts of impact evaluators, researchers, lawmakers, and organisations, ensuring transparency and standardisation in ecological impact assessment.\n\nIn the initial stages focus is on ecology / climate / environment and collaboration with EBF (ecological benefits framework): https://ebfcommons.org/  Long term, our goal as IEF is to be comprehensive and account for all sorts of impact: healthcare, education, finance, infrastructure, everything.\n\n### 2. Training program for impact verifiers\n**Objective:** Develop a training program that equips impact verifiers with the necessary skills and knowledge.\n**Components:**\n* Accessible Learning Platform: Provide a user-friendly platform accessible from any device, featuring video content and interactive modules.\n* Curriculum Development: Cover key topics such as impact measurement methodologies, data analysis, reporting standards, and use of the platform.\n* Practical Training: Include real-life case studies and scenarios to ensure practical understanding.\n* Certification: Offer certification upon successful completion, enhancing the credibility and employability of participants.\n\n**Benefits:** Build a global pool of qualified impact verifiers capable of conducting reliable and accurate assessments, fostering a standard of excellence in the field.\n\n### 3. Marketplace for impact verification services\n**Objective:** Design, develop, test and launch a marketplace for impact verification services, connecting verifiers with organisations needing verification.\n**Stakeholders:**\n* Impact Verifiers: Individuals who have completed the training program and are certified to conduct impact verifications.\n* Organisations: Companies requiring impact verification services, such as carbon credit companies, investors, and other stakeholders.\n\n**Features:**\n* Smart Contracts: Use blockchain technology to facilitate secure and transparent transactions between verifiers and organisations.\n* Reputation System: Implement a reputation-based system and leaderboard to incentivize accuracy and reliability among verifiers.\n* Impact Verification Marketplace: Provide a platform where organisations can find and hire qualified verifiers for their projects.\n\n**Benefits:** Create an efficient, transparent marketplace that fosters trust and accountability, ensuring high standards in ecological impact verification.\n\n### 4. Initial implementation and feedback loop\n**Objective:** Start with Mars (one of the co-initiators) as the first impact verifier to pilot the process and gather feedback.\n\n**Components:**\n* Mars will conduct initial impact verifications and write detailed reports, most likely locally in the UK\n* Lessons learned will be used to improve the wiki, training program, and platform.\n\n**Benefits:** Continuous improvement of resources and processes, informed by real-world experience.

Projects must indicate what collaborative mechanism they will utilize to govern, evaluate and compensate participant contributions (Coordinape, DeWork, Charmverse, Notion, DAO Haus, Google Docs & Sheets, etc)**\n\nCurrently we are using Notion and Telegram for coordination. For the purpose of evaluating contributions we intend to do self-evaluation: contributors listing their accomplishments and then peer review on the scale 0-10 by other contributors. Most likely Google Sheets because of the math.\n\n**7. Projects must indicate reasonable and verifiable milestones for the following possible funding amounts received: $1,000; $3,000; $6,000**\n\nOur plan is to follow the roadmap (mentioned above in this grant). Point 1 (Creating a wiki knowledge base) is always on, always fresh, always active, there will be always new items, housekeeping, editing, updating.\n\nThis is 💯 aligned with the requirement of this grant to focus on research. See this Telegram message: https://t.me/c/1859733621/1030\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3aIyKo7.jpeg)\n\nThe amount of funding *($1k $3k $6k the larger the better)* will enable us to get there faster, as it will relieve financial pressure and energy expense of seeking other sources of income. It is worth noting that we have sustainable business model (marketplace fee) that in the long run will enable us to operate without the reliance on grant funding.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"ImpactEvalFDN"},"metadataCid":"bafkreiaay5nj3ttcjlgk4ldahzvsbfhlydlcjmvswbl5kmqcv5sdixvcfq","timestamp":"2024-08-04T10:49:44+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xB7C41cC31Ae1b2073e41D906306e1a88AD550b4b","createdAtBlock":239320889},{"name":"ImpactEvaluation.Foundation (IEF)","id":"0xcad1a6beaa938fe34acd0afa4193a345b5cccdab775c2246b9dd56cb6b1d7f5d","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-04T20:33:00+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xB7C41cC31Ae1b2073e41D906306e1a88AD550b4b","createdAtBlock":27026311}],"projectId":"0xcad1a6beaa938fe34acd0afa4193a345b5cccdab775c2246b9dd56cb6b1d7f5d","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-04T20:33:15.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27026314"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T10:58:04.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27036691"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-04T20:33:15+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x0783D78dB71239ECcC0533FB7F2D52F01F207Ba9","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27031907,"createdByAddress":"0xF2C82A54d86ba94ba10a5906Af8A91d932FC3544","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"42","metadata":{"signature":"0xd473d99a7d1162fdd8861b2ed990b04e875c0d1a96a53685b7bba6f65195d8fe5d3ba78f09f62ea686bf0aaba96a39da1fd056fa7caed7d69ec53539849153ff1b","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"epysuVxEDnfz81LGTZpTgU26SDj0+x/hao1WWVCkhjtytGPJ3ai4hiZfzBzqgWz+","encryptedSymmetricKey":"5905be5a6853d09256d8356bc0f56d8730a8e9334471938df4406eb3efee84b6f9d81f104a5380b0cd667cd136528b12eab89877ec0d5d29e389b9bbc4f9917928981f323bd66a5a26f46b7436fddb6352f7feed250c227d688492b7c2a5cda384aaa3b81958ba03d8d07b1239d6542edd13dd3f1198ddc493f9b2b5dfe669c4000000000000002034bf7320e0df7b87ade6b7e8451a0d128588351b67e0d409d79b9eef6e002a98095ea5c0c2f81417e4b6ac8f3cd635b3"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"currenty none;

Specifically, we tackle the challenge of advocating for the rights of nature by developing AI-powered Environmental Avatars, such as the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar. These avatars serve as digital representations of natural entities like rivers and forests, enabling them to \"speak\" for themselves in legal, cultural, and policy contexts.\n\nThe Rio Sagrado AI-vatar, for example, helps to address the threats posed by environmental destruction in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. By integrating real-time environmental data and cultural knowledge, the AI-vatar acts as an advocate for the Rio Sagrado, raising awareness about the ecological importance of the river and the dangers posed by unplanned urbanization and infrastructure projects. This initiative has already catalyzed a community movement that seeks to recognize the river as a legal entity with inherent rights, a critical step towards protecting it from exploitation and destruction.\n\nMoreover, our project promotes the global adoption of similar AI-driven advocacy tools, empowering other communities to protect their natural environments. By providing an open-source toolkit and collaborating with international partners, we are fostering a broader movement that uses AI to give voice to the voiceless, ultimately contributing to the global effort to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Over the past two months, we have been thoroughly researching the best approach to expand the AI Avatar's tech stack into the web3 space. From the outset, Celo emerged as a standout option, not only because of its pioneering role in the ReFi movement but also due to its strong commitment to accessibility and inclusivity. These qualities align perfectly with the needs of the local communities we engage with, beginning with Rio Sagrado.\n\nOur plan is to deploy both the smart contracts for the SymbioToken and the accompanying dApp on the Celo blockchain. This dApp will allow users to interact with the SymbioToken contracts, manage their wallets, and participate in various activities supported by the AI Avatars. By using Celo’s MiniPay app, we aim to make these interactions as seamless and accessible as possible, especially for non-technical users in the communities we serve.\n\nThe integration of Celo's MiniPay into our platform is a strategic first step towards the broader web3 expansion of the AI Avatars. It provides a user-friendly gateway for individuals to engage with blockchain technology, even if they are unfamiliar with the complexities of web3. By choosing Celo, we not only tap into an ecosystem designed for global accessibility but also contribute to the expansion of its use cases within real-world environmental and community-driven projects.\n\nThrough this integration, we hope to contribute to the growing adoption of Celo, bringing novel application scenarios to its community.

The \"Rio Sagrado (Sacred River) AI-Avatar\", a SymbioTotem multimedia installation, represents this vision by interacting with its environment and the community. Moving into Phase 3, the project will shift from commercial LLM APIs to local LLMs and enable these systems to enter into smart contracts, rewarding sustainable actions with SymbioTokens. This initiative promotes the Rights of Nature and aims for autonomous eco-representatives.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe at [Sympoiesis](http://sympoiesis.xyz/) understand that the more-than-human complexes that make up life on Earth have valuable contributions to governance related dynamics, even more so in the context of the ongoing climate crisis. That is, other living beings have much to say about the choices we collectively make - especially those that affect multiple lifeforms sharing the same space, even if temporarily. And they do so not just as simple cold data providers but as sentient and conscious members of their communities. The big challenge is that, with modernity, we have lost the habit of naturally perceiving, interacting with, and internalizing their voices.\n\nIn this sense, Symbiocracy represents a deep inquiry towards ways of engaging with the more-than-human pluriverse, in order to propose interfaces that enable sensory-intuitive interactions and interspecific deliberative processes. An inquiry that is ever more practically relevant in light of advances in the Rights of Nature movement, substantiated by attribution of legal personhood and rights to non-human beings in many different countries. Whanganui River and Urewera Forest in Aotearoa New Zealand, and Komi-Memen River in Brazil to name a few.\n\nThe paths for this new kind of engagement with the more-than-human pluriverse can be approached through various forms. At Sympoiesis we are currently exploring how modern science and technology can be a vehicle for such, and thus a medium for the human reconnection with their own nature.\n\n## SymbioTotem and Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar\n\n![avatar_rio-sagrado_profile](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkv7GHNdA.png)\n(Rio Sagrado AI-vatar physical sculpture meshed with the River's waters)\n\n\n\nIn the official first Zuzalu Quadratic funding round we presented the [SymbioTotem](https://checker.gitcoin.co/public/project/show/symbiototem-by-sympoiesis) concept: \"a multimedia art/science installation designed to engage communities and facilitate interspecies interaction by interpreting and presenting local ecological data in a relatable manner.\" Since then, **the \"[Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar](https://kumu.io/emergir/sympoiesis#website/avatar-rio-sagrado)\" has been the primary proof-of-concept for the SymbioTotem**. Rooted in Zuzalu Montenegro, this political AI-vatar has been the test-ground for the consolidation of the technologies and community practices most appropriate to bootstrap such systems. And thanks to the financial support from the Zuzalu community we have been able to continue developing the project, which is currently on Phase 2 (Beta), featuring:\n\n- Continuous community engagement around the cultural and legal recognition of the River as an entity of right.\n- A LLM model instructed to represent the river informed by 30+ articles on the river watershed and dedicated sensors for live environmental monitoring. Accessed via:\n  - [Webpage interface](http://sympoiesis.xyz/rio-sagrado/)\n  - WhatsApp interface (+554196638496)\n  - Voice based in site interface via a physical sculpture (crafted by a native artist), that highlights the river's biodiversity and hosts the embedded computer system for the AI-vatar.\n\n![AI-vatar Pi copy](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkCoSB4dA.png)\n\nWith its modular and open-sourced codebase, the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar's backbone can be easily adapted to other implementations. In fact, conversations have started towards other applications for rivers in Brazil and Aotearoa New Zealand.

The \"Rio Sagrado (Sacred River) AI-Avatar\", a SymbioTotem multimedia installation, represents this vision by interacting with its environment and the community. Moving into Phase 3, the project will shift from commercial LLM APIs to local LLMs and enable these systems to enter into smart contracts, rewarding sustainable actions with SymbioTokens. This initiative promotes the Rights of Nature and aims for autonomous eco-representatives.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe at [Sympoiesis](http://sympoiesis.xyz/) understand that the more-than-human complexes that make up life on Earth have valuable contributions to governance related dynamics, even more so in the context of the ongoing climate crisis. That is, other living beings have much to say about the choices we collectively make - especially those that affect multiple lifeforms sharing the same space, even if temporarily. And they do so not just as simple cold data providers but as sentient and conscious members of their communities. The big challenge is that, with modernity, we have lost the habit of naturally perceiving, interacting with, and internalizing their voices.\n\nIn this sense, Symbiocracy represents a deep inquiry towards ways of engaging with the more-than-human pluriverse, in order to propose interfaces that enable sensory-intuitive interactions and interspecific deliberative processes. An inquiry that is ever more practically relevant in light of advances in the Rights of Nature movement, substantiated by attribution of legal personhood and rights to non-human beings in many different countries. Whanganui River and Urewera Forest in Aotearoa New Zealand, and Komi-Memen River in Brazil to name a few.\n\nThe paths for this new kind of engagement with the more-than-human pluriverse can be approached through various forms. At Sympoiesis we are currently exploring how modern science and technology can be a vehicle for such, and thus a medium for the human reconnection with their own nature.\n\n## SymbioTotem and Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar\n\n![avatar_rio-sagrado_profile](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkv7GHNdA.png)\n(Rio Sagrado AI-vatar physical sculpture meshed with the River's waters)\n\n\n\nIn the official first Zuzalu Quadratic funding round we presented the [SymbioTotem](https://checker.gitcoin.co/public/project/show/symbiototem-by-sympoiesis) concept: \"a multimedia art/science installation designed to engage communities and facilitate interspecies interaction by interpreting and presenting local ecological data in a relatable manner.\" Since then, **the \"[Rio Sagrado AI-Avatar](https://kumu.io/emergir/sympoiesis#website/avatar-rio-sagrado)\" has been the primary proof-of-concept for the SymbioTotem**. Rooted in Zuzalu Montenegro, this political AI-vatar has been the test-ground for the consolidation of the technologies and community practices most appropriate to bootstrap such systems. And thanks to the financial support from the Zuzalu community we have been able to continue developing the project, which is currently on Phase 2 (Beta), featuring:\n\n- Continuous community engagement around the cultural and legal recognition of the River as an entity of right.\n- A LLM model instructed to represent the river informed by 30+ articles on the river watershed and dedicated sensors for live environmental monitoring. Accessed via:\n  - [Webpage interface](http://sympoiesis.xyz/rio-sagrado/)\n  - WhatsApp interface (+554196638496)\n  - Voice based in site interface via a physical sculpture (crafted by a native artist), that highlights the river's biodiversity and hosts the embedded computer system for the AI-vatar.\n\n![AI-vatar Pi copy](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkCoSB4dA.png)\n\nWith its modular and open-sourced codebase, the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar's backbone can be easily adapted to other implementations. In fact, conversations have started towards other applications for rivers in Brazil and Aotearoa New Zealand. At the same time, we are especially eager to the moment in which we will be able to deploy such tech at a Zuzalu event, materializing our vision for the SymbioTotems to \"encourage the integration of environmental considerations in future Zuzalu events and the broader community, perhaps via the granting of citizenship status to nonhuman entities.\"\n\n## Towards Symbiocracy\n\nWith the ongoing Phase 2 (Beta) deployment of the Rio Sagrado AI-vatar/SymbioTotem we are drafting next steps for Phase 3, whose intent is twofold:\n- Move away from API-based (especially commercial) LLM services towards local LLM approaches;\n- Enable such systems to enter into contracts with the community (both local and global), in benefit of the source entity(ies) they represent.

This feature enhances scalability, ensuring large-scale reforestation initiatives with area based accounting are as meticulously managed as individual trees as well as for pre-planting propagation and logistics.\n \n🗺️ 🧺**Portfolio Management**: Embodying the democratization of reforestation, we believe that global efforts should be cohesively managed and brokered and we're growing a portfolio of impact across various forest and projects worldwide. Our goal is to operate this portfolio via a DAO structure after we launch a token\n\nFurther, we're collaborating with Orgs such as 🌻 Ecotech, dMeter, Regen Network, Filecoin, Hypercerts, ReFiDAO. Further, we'd like to collaborate and interop with other projects and technologies on techniques for statistical sampling of ground truth as well as remote sensing inference. And ultimately, we'd like to vertically integrate with carbon/ecocredit certifying projects, particularly through the lens of Ecological Benefits Framework. \n \n**Tokenomics:**\nOur long term plans involve launching a native governance token issued through tree commitments. Governance tokens will spawn utility NFT pairs that contain all the data and contracts for each tree.\n\n**Pilots:**\nTo date, Silvi has already deployed several pilots with the most recent being OperationWebTree involving 18 implementation partners. [Check out our reel by RefiMiami/GreenpillMiami](https://x.com/ReFiMiami/status/1759296369242599596?s=20)\n\n\nHowever, Silvi's biggest focus is currently [in Kenya](https://medium.com/@silvitree/introducing-silvi-the-tree-steward-platform-eb30fe9a2644), where it is connecting communities such as schools and small holder farmers to Kenya's last rainforest, Kakamega forest. Silvi is building a methodology to help establish small, distributed nursery beds around the forest with the goal of improving supply of saplings.  \n[![Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-12-07-46-AM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/yxMKb8zy/Screenshot-2024-04-12-at-12-07-46-AM.png)](https://postimg.cc/D4PRWF0S)\nWith the help of Gitcoin funding, Silvi has established operations in dozens of schools and nurserie, onboarded 300+ users and propagated 150k+ trees in Kenya. Our largest project is in Kakamega Forest, which is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries. Silvi is helping expand capacity of reforestation via its theory of change that a greater number of independent nurseries run by community members via a participatory model will help increase capacity and coordination. Silvi is close to being assigned an exclusive area for planting and forest management where our MRV and methodology will be put to the test over the following years.\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"SilviProtocol"},"recipient":"0xa7CA400d49BBa87EB606ee05af93689BD21FaB99"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreig4swxwk4vcki67kn5tyf7w5hnpti3liccqwvuh3lbu3fthbwgzb4","projects":[{"name":"Silvi","id":"0x183f13028588a3e6082d6642b52d4829823720efd1e5bc973856c406f1299b66","metadata":{"title":"Silvi","logoImg":"bafkreia2lxh62vyemnumlun3kzafdqlsuszyvneipn67xacw6nfs445nd4","website":"https://silvi.earth","bannerImg":"bafybeif4gscd7hssgankvzfrs4a4i6tka5ewbc44ydw4bkrwl5zllkyida","createdAt":1709771229881,"userGithub":"DjimoSerodio","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-27T08:11:40.644Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0x7246dcf4434c7613a9c2b7119bfeb67aa3db74137ec75e2a7e074a676e42b79b3065c02c160fb0c5ab9c8cae99e14b29e17421f74cf55b5bb7bebce7465fa3b31b","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-27T08:11:40.644Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-25T08:11:40.644Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xa7CA400d49BBa87EB606ee05af93689BD21FaB99","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#SilviProtocol#132837131","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:qGOfFdM5ue5hIVYgbSgiIAmmVkFxHCna1ux7aLDqLnE="]}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..b0QmD6SI2xk5N_JFe20qdBggt1yQJ_a02PAIz2APuDCP3XJXWEn8sk113UAuh9dhr-c9UUP-9Vl1dVArhjyUAg","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-03-07T00:22:39.641Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-03-07T00:22:39.641Z","expirationDate":"2024-06-05T00:22:39.641Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xa7CA400d49BBa87EB606ee05af93689BD21FaB99","hash":"v0.0.0:cglwTY+aA6w6HFHckDOpK33/HUBoT3nF9ZyhbH57oLg=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#SilviProtocol"}}},"description":"# 🌳🌳 **GG23 Update** 🌳🌳\nSince GG22, we have launched [Treekipedia](https://treekipedia.silvi.earth/) along with its [repo](https:github.com/SilviProtocol/silvi-open/tree/master/Treekipedia)(see below the Treekipedia section for an update), published [documentation](https://silvi.gitbook.io/silvi-app-user-guide), and continued to grow [OperationWebTree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QESx9MJ7uVneMNZw22qznnJgstklTqEI/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nSome of our recent wins include being funded by CELO to plant Ultra Green Trees as part of [CELO's Ultra Green Money ](https://blog.celo.org/ultragreen-money-c677e7508abb) innititative, winning a category prize at Eth Denver's Agentic Hackathon for Treekipedia and getting into Octant's Epoch 7 with Climate Coordination Network!\n\nOur [app](https://app.silvi.earth) continues to register and report on tree plantings as well as geotag mother trees of interest.

Our aim is to produce half a metric ton of charcoal per day, subsequently transformed into biochar for application in our expanding food forest and market garden, ultimately fostering a regenerative agricultural system._\n\n### Background:\n\nSet amidst the rich biodiversity of Alentejo, Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) has established a burgeoning food forest and market garden, supporting the nutritional needs of our community while embodying the Principles of Regeneration and Land Stewardship. The addition of a biochar production system aligns with our goals for sustainable land management, enhanced carbon sequestration, and the promotion of ecological balance.\n\n### Objective:\n\n-   Purchase, transport, and set up a gasifier for biochar production.\n\n-   Produce biochar for application in TDF's food forest and market garden, aiming to enrich soil fertility, improve water conservation, and enhance carbon storage.\n\n-   Produce capacity to apply biochar to our expanded  10-hectares food forest, thereby increasing our self-sufficiency in food production and furthering our contribution to ecological restoration.\n\n-   Research how to issue biochar carbon credits on-chain\n\n-   Producing benefits for all local stakeholders and proving we can create a planet positive DAO governed economy on a local scale\n\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\n-   Q2 2024: Acquisition and installation of the gasifier.\n\n-   Q3 2024: Training for staff and initiation of biochar production.\n\n-   Q4 2024 - Q1 2025: Application of biochar in the food forest and market garden.\n\n-   Q2 2025: Monitoring and evaluation of biochar's impact on soil health and crop yield.\n\n\n\nWe're super stoked to apply for a grant on behalf of Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) to bring an industrial-scale gasifier to our regenerative co-living village in Abela, Portugal. Our plan is to integrate biochar issuing into our system and collaborate with ReFi protocols.\n\nAt TDF, we're all about creating positive vibes and making a real impact on the environment. With the gasifier, we can turn organic waste into biochar, a super cool carbon-negative material that helps improve soil health and sequester carbon. And by integrating biochar issuing into our token-based system, we can reward our awesome community members for their regenerative efforts.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're teaming up with ReFi protocols to optimize our DAO's growth and explore new regenerative accounting metrics. We're also studying the possibility of issuing biochar carbon credits, checking out CHAR from Toucan and seeing how we can leverage Puro.earth for this.\n\nWe're also hosting a ReFi hackathon from June 10-14 to connect with experts and explore monitoring solutions and ways to increase water retention on our land, right in between a weekend with Regenesis and one with ReFi Lisboa. Join us there to buidl together!\n\nWith your support, we can make all of this happen. We'll bring the gasifier to TDF, integrate biochar issuing, and strengthen our ties with ReFi protocols. This will not only level up our regenerative practices but also serve as a shining example for other communities looking to do the same.","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"tdfinyourdreams"},"recipient":"0xf905c05a274b4775432b43D1b651e26039ec6354"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidowjupukfaohlyb7cyr2n6hhiwgphovfxbrzbltgwrng7w7o6y4a","projects":[{"name":"Traditional Dream Factory - the first web3 powered regenerative village - is investing in biochar-producing infrastructure","id":"0x9f03fa925e2044852d7a21b2d7eaad7a28df435e4e3387781aa9d79f5305aaee","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Traditional Dream Factory - the first web3 powered regenerative village - is investing in biochar-producing infrastructure","logoImg":"bafkreibjjgfb7gk2sjtr5i6jj4jmlurgzn7grml4zh3ueot5kenezscxmq","website":"https://traditionaldreamfactory.com/","bannerImg":"bafkreifn4vlgpiqdhix6ny6e3ulrxqpt5jhyaj4wg3kw6aeuh55kwzvrly","createdAt":1712788733274,"credentials":{},"description":"_This project seeks to utilize a gasifier for transforming biomass into biochar, a stable form of carbon that enriches soil health, supports water retention, and fosters biodiversity.

By connecting those in the value chain, starting with waste collectors and producers, we can efficiently recover waste for recycling or reuse, thus protecting our environment from the danger of waste mismanagement.\n\n- Important Link: https://linktr.ee/wasset\n\n## Problem addressed\nYearly, we generate about 2.3 billion metric tons of waste, contributing about 5% of GHG emissions worldwide. The damages now extend beyond just GHG emissions to issues like microplastic consumption, degradation of aquatic life, and flooding, among many other challenges. The problems can be summarized under:\n- Collection and recovery of waste\n- Funding for research, recovery, and scaling of businesses\n- Governance and policies around waste management\n- Digital Measurement Reporting and Verification\n\n## Solution\nWe have four core elements of the protocol, which are highlighted below:\n- The Marketplace addresses the issue of waste recovery and collection from households and businesses. \n- The Wasset token creates a unified open reward system for users to reward positive contributions and also incentivize existing players in the space.\n- The Wasset DAO will bring together players and regulators on policies, research, and funding innovation for impact scaling.\n- The Wasset Oracle helps resolve the issue around dMRV for waste using AI and decentralized storage technology.\n\n# Wasset Marketplace\n![Wasset Marketplace](https://gitgrantimages.s3.amazonaws.com/marketplace.png)\n- *Google Store:* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wasset.marketplace\n- *Apple Play Store:* http://apps.apple.com/ng/app/wasset/id6473405088\n\nThe marketplace connects different individuals in the waste value chain to encourage the commodification of waste through the exchange of recyclables.

Through the marketplace, different players exchange value and are rewarded based on the quantity or value of material they process.\n\n# Impact beyond rewards and incentives\nBeyond marketplace rewards and incentives, we have created utilities that extend the value of the marketplace to the following for users by providing:\n- Access to microinsurance (UBHI) service using their waste (recyclables) for a premium subscription\n- Access to microcredit payable using their waste over a stipulated time. User can easily access the credit by staking their NFT (live here: https://opensea.io/collection/wasset-og) as collateral and paying back using the token earned from selling their waste on the marketplace.\n- Access to the lottery program\n- Voting and participation in DAO governance\n\n# The Team \nWe have a diverse team of individuals ranging from engineering to management.\n\n## Founders\n- Boyejo Oluwafemi (CEO & COO)\n- Oyeniyi Abiola (CTO)\n\n\n## Core developers and contributors\n- Oracle (Blockchain developer)\n- kenzo (Operation manager)\n- FM (Product designer)\n- Bassit (Backend developer)\n- Jomoflash (DevOps engineer)\n- Ray King (Mobile application developer)\n- Badascript (Frontend developer)\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"DFMlab","projectTwitter":"wassetltd"},"recipient":"0x9f5d4083f595E55E66AD86AC2B614e65F57dD887"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreifut3c4ugkmpyo4yqn4vmxiutqmoexv6vwvtqq4gbrcjf74vfwu3u","projects":[{"name":"Wasset","id":"0x6a137a9592c503b53957f27ddd8ebb0d6d227873a789cc296de6151bab6a92c2","metadata":{"title":"Wasset","logoImg":"bafkreiahhxw2d4hwrfoy55fgqknwmly5b42xy5w6tzivy6w2rhfn3p3czy","website":"https://wasset.io","bannerImg":"bafkreidi4f5mnsd4qz2r677qwhtgvvhe6pozakbkb7id5eefvlsf5y2qx4","createdAt":1712250573066,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..d-dabXTEEHpNgHP4WPrOeE2rIGVzmRqQAb3j9tpO1a6aoU0etBWR_FCVD7OfQDpb0yLIAM4motR8eFTEsjLYAA","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-04T17:07:37.306Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-04T17:07:37.306Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-03T17:07:37.306Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xD093E19E4ba39EAba85722a1d49F090c6FBb8bd3","hash":"v0.0.0:2rNcYYZCxE5L3r1A4iJ9mUYkGUS420CwcozW/ptVKs0=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#wassetltd"}}},"description":"Wasset is a protocol that promotes sustainable waste management, leveraging blockchain technology's transparency and tokenization to create an incentive-driven waste circular economy.

Built on the Celo blockchain and leveraging the use of stablecoins, Washika DAO provides a robust platform for savings, lending, and governance, designed to empower communities and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nIssues We’re Tackling\nIn emerging markets, access to credit remains a critical barrier to economic growth and financial inclusion. Traditional banking systems often fail to serve the needs of small businesses and individuals, especially those in low-income earning communities. Despite the progress in making banking services accessible such as banking the unbanked with a basic feature phone and ID barriers to credit access continue to impede financial empowerment. High-interest rates, stringent lending requirements, and limited financial literacy are significant challenges. \n\nOur focus is on scalable solutions that integrate innovation with existing community practices, such as the Washika DAO protocol, to create sustainable economic growth and resilience, while critically assessing the trade-offs and impacts on marginalized communities. By examining the potential of novel credit systems to empower local economies, enhance financial autonomy, and reduce dependency on conventional traditional structures.\n\nOur paper explores innovative approaches to credit delivery, leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and community-driven models. Central to this exploration is the question:\n At what cost are marginalized communities truly financially included?\n\n- Financial Exclusion: Millions of people in marginalized communities lack access to basic financial services. Washika DAO provides an inclusive platform that empowers these communities through alternative means to financing in DeFi.\n- Lack of Transparency: Traditional financial systems often suffer from opacity and corruption. Our blockchain-based solution ensures all transactions and decisions are transparent and immutable as well as all governance decisions stored onchain for transparency and proper record keeping.\n- High Transaction Costs: By leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) principles and stablecoins utilities, we significantly reduce the cost of transactions, making financial services more affordable for marginalized communities facing high transaction costs.\n- Inefficient Lending Processes: Traditional lending processes can be slow and bureaucratic. Washika DAO automates and streamlines the process, providing quick and fair access to credit.\n\n\nGovernance\n- At the heart of Washika DAO is a decentralized governance model that ensures all members have a voice in the decision-making process. Any existing Chama can create a DAO in 3 simple steps, adding relevant fields such as members, multisig holders etc. without having to worry about web3. Anyone in the DAO is also able to put up a proposal reviewed by all at anytime. Key features include:\n- Democratic Voting: Members can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, interest rates, loan terms, and other critical decisions.\n- Transparent Operations: All governance activities are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n- Community-driven Proposals: Any member can submit proposals, fostering a collaborative environment where the best ideas can flourish.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\n\nSavings:\nCommunities already operate a savings pool offchain through a model known as “Mchezo'' in Swahili, where the funds pooled shift hands every month. Washika DAO’s savings mechanism is designed to encourage financial discipline and provide a safe, transparent way to save money:\n- Secure & TransparentSavings Accounts: Members can open savings accounts that are securely managed by smart contracts.

Built on the Celo blockchain and leveraging the use of stablecoins, Washika DAO provides a robust platform for savings, lending, and governance, designed to empower communities and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nIssues We’re Tackling\nIn emerging markets, access to credit remains a critical barrier to economic growth and financial inclusion. Traditional banking systems often fail to serve the needs of small businesses and individuals, especially those in low-income earning communities. Despite the progress in making banking services accessible such as banking the unbanked with a basic feature phone and ID barriers to credit access continue to impede financial empowerment. High-interest rates, stringent lending requirements, and limited financial literacy are significant challenges. \n\nOur focus is on scalable solutions that integrate innovation with existing community practices, such as the Washika DAO protocol, to create sustainable economic growth and resilience, while critically assessing the trade-offs and impacts on marginalized communities. By examining the potential of novel credit systems to empower local economies, enhance financial autonomy, and reduce dependency on conventional traditional structures.\n\nOur paper explores innovative approaches to credit delivery, leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and community-driven models. Central to this exploration is the question:\n At what cost are marginalized communities truly financially included?\n\n- Financial Exclusion: Millions of people in marginalized communities lack access to basic financial services. Washika DAO provides an inclusive platform that empowers these communities through alternative means to financing in DeFi.\n- Lack of Transparency: Traditional financial systems often suffer from opacity and corruption. Our blockchain-based solution ensures all transactions and decisions are transparent and immutable as well as all governance decisions stored onchain for transparency and proper record keeping.\n- High Transaction Costs: By leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) principles and stablecoins utilities, we significantly reduce the cost of transactions, making financial services more affordable for marginalized communities facing high transaction costs.\n- Inefficient Lending Processes: Traditional lending processes can be slow and bureaucratic. Washika DAO automates and streamlines the process, providing quick and fair access to credit.\n\n\nGovernance\n- At the heart of Washika DAO is a decentralized governance model that ensures all members have a voice in the decision-making process. Any existing Chama can create a DAO in 3 simple steps, adding relevant fields such as members, multisig holders etc. without having to worry about web3. Anyone in the DAO is also able to put up a proposal reviewed by all at anytime. Key features include:\n- Democratic Voting: Members can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, interest rates, loan terms, and other critical decisions.\n- Transparent Operations: All governance activities are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n- Community-driven Proposals: Any member can submit proposals, fostering a collaborative environment where the best ideas can flourish.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\n\nSavings:\nCommunities already operate a savings pool offchain through a model known as “Mchezo'' in Swahili, where the funds pooled shift hands every month. Washika DAO’s savings mechanism is designed to encourage financial discipline and provide a safe, transparent way to save money:\n- Secure & TransparentSavings Accounts: Members can open savings accounts that are securely managed by smart contracts. The balances will be scraped from their existing holding accounts such as bank / mobile money wallet (M-Pesa)\n- Interest Earnings: Savings pooled in the DAO earn interest, which is distributed back to the members proportionally. This adds value to the idle funds sat in their pool/ bank account.\n- Automated Management: In the near future, Smart contracts automate the process of interest calculation and distribution, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.\n\n[![balance.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pT5GvpMw/balance.png)](https://postimg.cc/Pphzzfxy)\n\nLending:\n- Washika DAO revolutionizes the traditional lending process with a decentralized, community-focused approach:\n- Peer-to-Peer & Group Lending: Members can apply for loans that are funded directly by the community’s pooled savings. Communities can also collectively apply for a loan at better terms through a collateralized asset, such as liquid bond in this case.\n- Fair Loan Terms: Loans are granted based on predefined criteria, ensuring fairness and reducing the risk of default.\n\n- Automated Repayments: Repayment schedules are managed by smart contracts, making the process seamless and reliable.\n\nWhat We’re Building on Celo:\nComprehensive Governance & Financial Platform: A user-friendly interface for participating in governance, transparency in managing of funds and savings as well as applying for cost-efficient loans through alternative means of financing.\n\nBlockchain Integration: Utilizing the Celo blockchain to ensure security, transparency, utility in stablecoin settlements & store of value and efficiency.

It was founded by nature lovers to create a positive impact on the planet.\n\nWe are NOT another carbon credits based organization! We aim on delivering real, tangible ecological impact.\n\n**🔴Problems Addressed**\n\n1. The global environmental crisis, characterized by unprecedented levels of biodiversity loss, deforestation, climate change, soil degradation, and other challenges, poses a pressing issue for humanity.\n\n2. Traditional fundraising methods often suffer from issues such as lack of transparency, high operating costs, and a lack of trust, which can limit the effectiveness of efforts to address these challenges.\n\n❗Lack of transparency and trust - It can be difficult for donors to know how their donations are being used, how much was used for Impact vs. Operations, etc.\n\n❗Middlemen and overhead cost - A portion of donations may be used to cover operational and administrative expenses.\n\n❗Potential for fraud - There have been many cases of charity organizations misusing funds or being outright scams.\n\n❗Limited control - Once a donation is made, the donor typically has no further say in how the funds are used or distributed.\n\n❗Limited or no connection with impact generated - Once a donation is made, the donor typically isn’t made aware of the actual impact generated by their generosity.\n\n**💡 Our Solution**\n\n✅We designed a platform that connects the donor with the impact generated by their generosity that provides full transparency and accessibility to track all donations and contributions to the Anu Initiative’s Treasury all the way to Actual Impact generated by our trusty Impact Partners.\n\n✅By integrating these solutions, Anu Initiative can help overcome the traditional challenges of environmental fundraising and create a robust, transparent, and effective mechanism for environmental impact.\n\n✅Blockchain Technology for Transparency - Utilize blockchain tech to track donations from the moment they are made until they are spent, and moreover, all the way down to the impact generated. This ensures that donors can see exactly where their money is going and how it is being used, addressing the transparency and trust issues.\n\n✅Direct Impact Tracking - Develop a system that connects donations to specific projects and outcomes in a live manner. For each project funded, there should be a clear set of expected results, and donors and the public should receive reports on the project's progress and impact. Funded projects should be displayed on a public dashboard.\n\n✅Reduce Overhead with Technology - Automate various administrative and operational tasks using software to reduce the need for middlemen and cut down on overhead costs. This allows a larger portion of donations to go directly to environmental projects.\n\n✅Engagement and Feedback Loop - Create a platform where donors can vote on projects they want to support, providing them with control over how their donations are used and fostering a deeper connection with the impact generated.\n\n✅Impact Investment Fund - Establish a fund to invest in startups and technologies that provide ecological benefits, with profits being reinvested into the Anu Initiative’s projects.\n\n✅Feedback and Adaptation - Implement a feedback mechanism where donors, partners, and beneficiaries can suggest improvements to the Anu Initiative’s processes, ensuring that the organization remains responsive and adaptable to the needs of the environment and its stakeholders.\n\n**🌱Roadmap:**\n\n**Administrative:**\n1.

PORTERS simplifies the creation and management of RPC endpoints for blockchain applications, allowing developers to focus on innovation without the hassle of backend complexities. PORTERS leverages the POKT Network's extensive node infrastructure, consisting of thousands of nodes globally, to provide its RPC services.\n\n### Mission\n\nPORTERS aims to lower the barrier to entry for blockchain development by providing a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation. This approach enables even those with minimal blockchain experience to implement complex functionalities. \n\nBy exposing a decentralised RPC service layer for providing seamless access, PORTERS enhances privacy, reduces single points of failure, and provides a more resilient infrastructure for blockchain applications.\n\nWe are the exception by offering Web3-native payments, enabling users to swap their crypto directly to pay for RPC relays without the need to use a credit card.\n\nHere are a few screenshots to give you a glimpse of our interface.\n[![temp-Image-NAHXJY.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/W3fw6xtf/temp-Image-NAHXJY.avif)](https://postimg.cc/5YLzf7Bw)\n\nSwap from your favourite token! \n[![temp-Imagek4bt-F1.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/C1t6LRC1/temp-Imagek4bt-F1.avif)](https://postimg.cc/LYtVx6bK)\n\nChoose from more than 40+ supported chains\n[![temp-Image-J1zc6f.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/Nf78MyB0/temp-Image-J1zc6f.avif)](https://postimg.cc/0bjKXy6g)\n\nStart using PORTERS now and make the little data graph smile :)\n[![temp-Imagew9l-Yz-Q.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/d0dVsCcH/temp-Imagew9l-Yz-Q.avif)](https://postimg.cc/f3zN5JLm)\n\n\n### Progress Since Gitcoin Grant Round 20\n\nSince the last Gitcoin Round, the PORTERS platform was officially launched in early June 2024.\n\nWe have been actively acquiring new users, including public goods projects, and forming partnerships.\n\nOn the technical side, we have been working on several features, including:\n\n1. Integration with additional blockchain networks.\n\t- Together with our partners at Taiko we are now one of very few providers of a free public endpoint that is not rate limited. In the future, we would like to explore how this could benefit other ecosystems as well.\n2. Development of a decentralised data API. \n\nAdditionally, we are currently onboarding several projects that are going to use our RPC services and improve the user experience based on the feedback received during the onboarding process. \n\n### How We Will Use the Funds\n\nWe participated in the GG20 \"Web3 Infrastructure\" round and received enthusiastic support despite being relatively new to the community. We are grateful for this and wish to give back. Therefore, we are applying to Gitcoin 21 Rounds as a DePIN project and aim to support public goods initiatives participating in this round. \n\nWe commit to allocating 50% of the donations we receive in this round to finance the RPC relays for public good projects participating in Gitcoin 21 and building on EVM-compatible blockchains. Just reach out to us on Discord or via  [info@porters.xy](mailto:info@porters.xyz)  and we will provide you with further instructions on how to start using PORTERS and integrate blockchain functionalities into your project.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be invested in continuous improvements and technical maintenance of the platform.\n\n### Current Team Members\n\n- **Sasquatch** – Partnerships & Community Management\n- **benedictvs** – Business & Development\n- **Matthew** – Full Stack Developer\n- **vicos** – Design & Marketing\n\n### Past Contributors\nWe want to acknowledge and appreciate the invaluable people who contributed to PORTERS' development up until and shortly after its launch:\n\n- **sayonara** – Frontend Developer\n- **plor** – Backend Developer\n\nAnd a special appreciation for [RaidGuild](raidguild.org) which brought the Team together.\n\n### Additional Information\nFor more information, check out the [recording of the talk](https://youtu.be/MIQwe5J6sQA?feature=shared) that PORTERS' representative held during ETH Belgrade in early June 2024.\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"porters-xyz","projectTwitter":"PORTERSXYZ"},"recipient":"0x661064447c6EA393eA93020933f36e7bdE4340Fd"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreihqh2klm6safj2n7uhz22qdsbch2r4vjprpvuu46reyjg2v6eho6m","projects":[{"name":"PORTERS","id":"0x68fd0ec0d2e8de4f84960fde41c25ff504ed4764b968b94adcd4cdca9b671195","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-09-13T11:30:20+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xB1a87B31d3C13c47a1dac755d48845abE49cFE2D","createdAtBlock":18466333},{"name":"PORTERS","id":"0x68fd0ec0d2e8de4f84960fde41c25ff504ed4764b968b94adcd4cdca9b671195","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-12T20:44:40+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xB1a87B31d3C13c47a1dac755d48845abE49cFE2D","createdAtBlock":95250534},{"name":"Porters","id":"0x68fd0ec0d2e8de4f84960fde41c25ff504ed4764b968b94adcd4cdca9b671195","metadata":{"title":"OnboardAI","logoImg":"bafkreid4b4tmbzz3c55wrcabvuied2ishtny6qjrfycfyeftfgeafcr55y","website":"https://porters.xyz","bannerImg":"bafkreidp42kue5qgpoqcwxpbgtqpghvju2ar5u4qko7hljo4qwljvreaoi","createdAt":1713105048852,"userGithub":"vicosv","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..WPQsLgC0MuN1M74D5PI9t_mLy2jp8MqruSGF6cENPKrkO5RkKPLA42c3sEc0Tm8nwHiFKlmiTl80n52k9f0kBQ","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-10-18T18:57:14.759Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-10-18T18:57:14.759Z","expirationDate":"2025-01-16T18:57:14.759Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB1a87B31d3C13c47a1dac755d48845abE49cFE2D","hash":"v0.0.0:8IkWGcT68E/Njya+778fNqW1RTUODq4X75v8L5Nwzyo=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#porters-xyz#130321827"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..tP4NvrjMkgB57sDELlpzyaUDhjBxaMBTt94GVuBahv-ImcsXu2NMJDv4RHyOJYeRvm1eVru0UfzFeDgVu4KACw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-14T14:30:37.320Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-14T14:30:37.320Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-13T14:30:37.320Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB1a87B31d3C13c47a1dac755d48845abE49cFE2D","hash":"v0.0.0:CxnaaXNocP3UY/eR/sX8zUA2iyYIi1/+nqi2UM5v6Gk=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#PORTERSXYZ"}}},"description":"## ✍️ Project Description\n\nOnboardAI is a messaging-first onboarding assistant that helps new users safely explore Web3. Delivered via WhatsApp and Telegram, it offers 24/7 AI-powered support and human coaching — all in plain language. We’re currently in the research phase, mapping real user needs in emerging markets to develop an onboarding tool that truly works.\n\nThis project was born out of our experience building PORTERS, a previous Gitcoin-funded initiative that explained blockchain infrastructure to curious Web3 users. What we learned was clear: even builders, DAO contributors, and crypto-savvy users often struggle to understand blockchain infrastructure, let alone newcomers. We spent so much time creating simple analogies and breaking down core ideas that we realized onboarding itself needed a new approach.\n\nWe believe Web3 adoption starts with education — and education starts with conversation.\n\n\n\n## 💸 How Funds Will Be Used\n\nWe’re building a free, multilingual AI tutor that lives inside the apps people already use: WhatsApp and Telegram. Gitcoin funding will help us:\n\n- 🌍 Localize onboarding flows for Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia  \n- 🧠 Train the AI to explain Web3 basics in simple terms (wallets, swaps, gas fees)  \n- 💬 Offer expert human help for more complex questions  \n- 📊 Open-source anonymized data insights to help others understand onboarding gaps\n\n\n\n## 🌱 Our mission\n\nRight now, new users often bounce off Web3 because it's confusing, unsafe, or hard to access.

By shifting from a centralized governance model to a community-led approach, we will foster habits that prioritize collective stewardship and active participation in urban space governance.\nDemocratic Digitalization: The project promotes democratic digitalization by leveraging digital tools to enable community-driven governance. This will ensure that decisions about urban space usage are made democratically, reflecting the diverse needs and interests of the community. Through digital platforms, citizens will have the opportunity to participate in and influence decision-making processes directly.\nCommons: By focusing on the commons, the project aims to transform underutilized urban spaces into shared resources that benefit the entire community. This approach will foster a sense of collective stewardship and responsibility, ensuring that these spaces are used in ways that promote social, cultural, and economic well-being.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Our project will be one of the first projects with web3 elements being used/integrated with Korean public services.

Envisioned as a set of tools that integrate community designed protocols, a database of available spaces in the city, a layered permissions architecture, and a user-friendly interface to navigate the booking, using, and managing of spaces, this digital platform will radically transform the way citizens and institutions engage with urban spaces.\n\n**UNLOCKING SPATIAL ASSETS IN THE CITY**\n\nIn many post-industrial Asian cities, the problem of urban decline and vacancy is rising, due to significant population and economic/industrial decline. We focus on a city in South Korea called Daegu, one of the most important former industrial hubs. In Daegu, the old city center in particular is facing a critical transition, with many commercial and mixed-use properties left vacant for years. Having worked with the City administration since 2021, we found that there was a vibrant cultural scene and a community of young people actively wanting to utilize these spaces. However, due to rigid, centralized governance and restrictive regulation that do not reflect the needs and desires of local communities, many spaces were left underutilized, creating missed opportunities for community engagement and economic regeneration. Our project seeks to transform these spaces into civic assets by implementing a flexible, community-driven governance (permissions) model that encourages citizen participation and fosters a sense of collective stewardship — ultimately empowering communities to transform these spaces into valuable public goods.\n\n**PROTOTYPING PHASE**\n\nWe were fortunate enough to receive a government grant that spans 6 months in 2024. While the project concept has been in development since 2021 (first grant received through the Bloomberg Mayors Challenge - allowing us to experiment with chatbots as an interface), this is the first time that we are able to fully fund the development of the digital platform. In the next 5 months, we are planning an intense prototyping and testing phase which culminates in an on-site testing in one or two spaces in Daegu, in partnership with the City administration.

We are building a simple and customizable on-chain plastic waste recycling system, where individuals exchange their waste for on-chain digital assets in a peer-to-peer market.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nPlastic waste has become a global environmental crisis, with millions of tons of plastic ending up in landfills, oceans, and other natural habitats. Traditional recycling systems are often inefficient, lack transparency, and fail to incentivize individuals and communities to actively participate in recycling efforts. This results in a significant amount of recyclable plastic going to waste and contributing to environmental degradation.\n\nSolution:\n\nOur goal is to facilitate on-chain value distribution for plastic recycling through value-driven incentives. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a transparent and efficient recycling ecosystem where individuals are rewarded with digital assets for their contributions to plastic waste collection. This not only motivates more people to participate in recycling but also ensures that the value generated from recycled materials is fairly distributed.\n\nWe have been conducting plastic collection for recycling factories across Nigeria for 8 months, gaining insights into how plastic users and recyclers want to participate in the on-chain value distribution. This experience has allowed us to refine our system and tailor it to meet the needs of both recyclers and plastic users, ensuring a seamless and rewarding recycling process.\n\nKey Impacts:\n\n1. Environmental Preservation: By incentivizing plastic recycling, EarthFi helps reduce plastic waste in landfills and oceans, contributing to cleaner and healthier ecosystems.\n\n2. Community Empowerment: Individuals and communities benefit from exchanging plastic waste for digital assets, creating new economic opportunities and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the environment.\n\n3. Transparency and Trust: Blockchain technology ensures transparency in the recycling process, building trust among participants and ensuring that the value generated is fairly distributed.\n\n4. Scalable and Customizable: Our system is designed to be scalable and customizable, allowing it to be adapted to different regions and recycling needs, thus maximizing its impact globally.\n\n5.

We are currently operational in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.\nA major barrier to mass blockchain adoption in Africa is limited integration of digital assets with the existing payment rails, making it difficult and complex to use digital assets on everyday transactions or purchases.\nOur platform makes crypto assets usable in day to day transactions similar to the way people use fiat currencies.\nFor example, users are able to pay for groceries at the local grocery stores, pay for shopping at supermarkets, pay for bills at restaurants and pay for all their related goods and services at merchant points using digital assets.\nAdditionally, we facilitate cross-border payments focusing on intra-africa trades.\nWe’re on a mission to blur the distinction between existing payment rails and digital assets.\nOur impact on Celo ecosystem\n1/ Boost daily transaction volumes and transaction values\nBy enabling users to use their crypto assets for everyday transactions, we anticipate a significant increase in transaction volumes and values on the Celo network.

We are currently operational in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.\nA major barrier to mass blockchain adoption in Africa is limited integration of digital assets with the existing payment rails, making it difficult and complex to use digital assets on everyday transactions or purchases.\nOur platform makes crypto assets usable in day to day transactions similar to the way people use fiat currencies.\nFor example, users are able to pay for groceries at the local grocery stores, pay for shopping at supermarkets, pay for bills at restaurants and pay for all their related goods and services at merchant points using digital assets.\nAdditionally, we facilitate cross-border payments focusing on intra-africa trades.\nWe’re on a mission to blur the distinction between existing payment rails and digital assets.\nOur impact on Celo ecosystem\n1/ Boost daily transaction volumes and transaction values\nBy enabling users to use their crypto assets for everyday transactions, we anticipate a significant increase in transaction volumes and values on the Celo network. This boost will enhance the overall activity within the Celo ecosystem.\n \n2/ Enhanced confidence and trust to hold Celo assets\nBy enabling users to use their Celo assets for day to day transactions, our platform increases users confidence in holding and using Celo assets. This will consequently lead to higher adoption rates of Celo assets and stablecoins. Additionally with the seamless day to day transactions and lower costs offered by the Celo network, their trust in the Celo ecosystem will grow, encouraging more users to join and utilize Celo assets.\n3/ Community growth\nAs our platform grows in transaction value, transaction volume and number of users, there will be increased opportunities for partnerships with other projects, both within and outside the Celo ecosystem, further strengthening the Celo community.

Helpers Foundation will conduct these event in different communities including campuses, colleges, and public schools, reaching Nigerian people who are eager to learn how to safely use CELO to improve their lives.\n[![Whats-App-Image-2024-07-14-at-6-52-21-AM-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BQHV47Mc/Whats-App-Image-2024-07-14-at-6-52-21-AM-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/nCVk128C)\n\n During the events, we will identify students who are in need and use part of our funds to sponsor their education to clearly demonstrate how this CELO- funded initiative can touch human lives physically and with immediate positive impacts.\n[![Helpers-Foundation-STEM.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XXSg84FV/Helpers-Foundation-STEM.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FkpcFtDq)\n\n## THE SOLUTION\n\nThis project will educate young people on the importance of the CELO network and how it can be used to sponsor their education and fund other public goods. Accelerating young people's knowledge of technology and financial literacy while building leaders, innovators, and creators for a decentralized future.\nAt the end of the event, all the participants will be guided to set up a CELO wallet address. Funds raised for this initiative will be sent to the wallet address of each participant for their transportation for coming and going for the event. This initiative will also send funds to any needy students  to help sponsor their education in Nigeria. CELO education for young people will assist them in coming up with new ideas on how to effectively use cryptocurrency for public good.\n\n[![solar-6.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Vk4VY0nn/solar-6.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/tsZ5kTr4)\n\n## Project Timeline\n•  September: Hold event at the University of Nigeria Enugu, campus\n•   October: Hold event at Enugu State college of education, main campus. \nOctober: Hold event in secondary schools in Enugu State.\n\n## Helpers Foundation Road Map and Metrics\n•   Provide free education to 200 underprivileged children who do not hope to go to school annually. \n•\tProvide climate education to 500 students every year in our primary school, community center,, and workshops\n•\tUtilize our solar water pump and well to provide water for 400 members of our community.\n•\t100 Empower young people, women, and youth annually through our digital skills training centers so that they can build climate resilience as agricultural production decreases and climate change threatens traditional livelihoods.\n•\tPartner with The Solar Foundation to develop a solar-powered Public Charging Station for our community to charge their mobile phones and devices.\n•  Planting 213 trees with pupils in public schools without tree.\n•  Establishment of solar powered store in rural community in Enugu State in partnership with The Radical system.\n•  Distribution of free solar lantern to rural women in community without adequate electricity in Enugu State.\n\n\n## About Us\n**Helpers Social Development Foundation** is a duly registered nonprofit and nonpolitical organization in Nigeria that was formed in 2016 and officially registered with the Nigeria Corporate Affairs Commission on 27th June 2019. \n\nThe executive director, Okeke Chidi Chinwendu and his wife established the NGO with a mission to reach millions of less privileged Africans who are facing the same problems he faced while growing up in a small village in Nigeria.

By providing affordable and accessible cross-border payment services, we are helping to bridge the financial divide in Africa and contribute to a more inclusive global financial system.","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0xa4d85ffceeca40d184cc8487d103d31645f86b9027c6617beffc7413bc75229b","title":"CPAYANT","logoImg":"bafkreidhkncrznnfmfe4tdwzomdooxjf4a3uxdeplkjrtjdfuptlv6mzjm","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreiehamwrlty5cswj46rfslcthl3jpfeoq6eze5qly6bh6a5lkh4uyq","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://cpayant.com/","bannerImg":"bafkreieziy674slyyxlkumvb3wyo5ttdnrozn5up5t7np7nkz2mroyg2zm","createdAt":1722600231847,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..u49zhLGCOCxUNCSeg2KK51OT4X77Z5aB_ZwAr21ZtGxpgxvQInbzsbMivuZ5GQwz1HuRI9AFNyO7Xazes45eDw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-02T11:56:18.032Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-02T11:56:18.032Z","expirationDate":"2024-10-31T11:56:18.032Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xa600F82b389D4391E7d2dC461766B0ea8598632f","hash":"v0.0.0:OhauQSRt5eXoZBfK1h+gxvH8Tt8/hIgFuSKO6OvNR4s=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#cpayantmobile"}}},"description":"CPayant: Driving Financial Inclusion Through Celo\n\nCPayant is a fintech pioneer, revolutionizing cross-border payments across Africa.

faced by millions in Africa and other emerging markets. Traditional stablecoin on/off ramps, such as MoonPay, impose high barriers to entry, including a $30 minimum transaction and fees as high as 25% for small swaps. This makes digital finance inaccessible to low-income individuals who need it most. Additionally, many people lack the liquidity required to become agents on major platforms like Binance, preventing them from earning income through cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nSargo solves these problems by democratizing access to financial services through its decentralized application (dApp). By enabling micro-swaps starting from just $0.5 with a minimal 2% fee, Sargo breaks down the barriers that have historically excluded underbanked populations from the digital economy. The platform integrates seamlessly with widely used Web2 and Web3 wallets, such as M-Pesa and MetaMask, making P2P cryptocurrency swaps accessible, affordable, and secure. Moreover, Sargo empowers merchants to earn income on every swap they facilitate, creating new economic opportunities starting from just $0.5.\n\nBy providing low-cost, accessible financial services, Sargo is fostering financial inclusion, empowering individuals to participate in the digital economy, and driving economic growth in underserved communities across Africa and beyond.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Sargo significantly enhances the Celo ecosystem by driving growth in users, transactions, and wallet adoption, particularly among underbanked populations in emerging markets.\n\nGrowth of Users: Sargo’s focus on low-cost micro-swaps and seamless integration with popular Web2 and Web3 wallets like M-Pesa and MetaMask makes it accessible to a wide range of users, including those who are typically excluded from digital financial services. By onboarding these underbanked populations, Sargo helps to expand the user base within the Celo ecosystem, bringing more individuals into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nGrowth of Transactions: Sargo’s platform facilitates high volumes of small transactions, with the potential to scale to 1 million swaps annually. This drives significant transaction activity on the Celo blockchain, increasing the overall transaction volume and liquidity within the ecosystem. The more transactions conducted on Celo, the more robust and resilient the network becomes.\n\nGrowth of Wallets: Sargo encourages the use of Celo-compatible wallets through its integration and incentive programs. By making it easy for users to engage in P2P swaps directly from wallets they already trust, Sargo supports the adoption and retention of these wallets within the Celo ecosystem. The platform’s referral incentives further promote the creation and use of these wallets, expanding the wallet ecosystem and enhancing user engagement.\n\nGrowth of Savings and Liquidity: By incentivizing merchants to keep funds in their wallets, Sargo boosts liquidity within the Celo ecosystem.

Data on food production, energy savings, and user engagement will be collected to refine the model.\n\nGoal: Facilitate Financial Inclusion\n•\tSmart Contract Development: Design and deploy smart contracts for registration, PyraPOD acquisition, and data collection, enabling families to own PyraPODs through a structured financial model using smart contracts and tokenomics.\n•\tNFT-based Ownership Model: Implement an NFT-based system to track and manage PyraPOD assets, fostering transparency and accountability.\n\n🌲Phase 2: Community Engagement and Expansion\n\nGoal: Promote Renewable Energy Adoption\n•\tPlatform Development: Create a user-friendly digital platform for registration, monitoring, and community collaboration. Integrate AI-driven data collection and reporting systems to optimize PyraPOD performance.\n•\tDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and NFTs: Utilize these technologies to engage communities in renewable energy projects.\n\nGoal: Strengthen Community Empowerment\n•\tPartnership Building: Engage with local councils, NGOs, and industry partners to expand the PyraPOD network. Collaborate with stakeholders to refine the financial model and community incentives.\n•\tCollaboration Platform: Develop a platform to connect innovators, leaders, and community members in sustainable energy projects.\n\n🌲Phase 3: Scale and Impact\nGoal: Global Deployment\n•\tExpand the PyraPOD Initiative: Target international markets, focusing on regions vulnerable to climate change. Leverage blockchain technology for cross-border collaboration and investment.\n•\tImpact Assessment: Conduct comprehensive assessments to measure improvements in food security, energy efficiency, and community resilience.\n\nGoal: Engage with Carbon Markets\n•\tCarbon Metrics Integration: Incorporate carbon metrics and engage with the carbon credits market to further promote environmental sustainability and to reward participant families.\n\n🌲Credentials\nThe Family Food Bank project is led by Richard Nelson, an innovative leader in sustainable technology and the inventor of SolaRoof Technology. Richard's extensive experience in the OpenSource community is demonstrated through his collaborations and his commitment to advancing humanitarian innovations. \n\nHis collaborative efforts include working with ENVIENTA on the SolaRoof PyraPOD initiative and expanding partnerships with organizations like PyraPOD Global Inc., his flagship OpenSource commercialization partner. \n\nRichard's pioneering work, such as the development of the BubblePOD shelter system and the PyraPOD, underscores his dedication to providing sustainable solutions to address global food, water, and energy challenges. \n\nRichard's innovative strategies and partnerships with CoMissioner Rolf Helberg in Norway, as well as his ongoing work in China, exemplify his leadership in creating a cooperative global enterprise network.\n\n🌲Progress To-date\nThe Family Food Bank project has made significant strides in laying the groundwork for its mission to enhance food security and community resilience. The project is currently in the Alpha Phase, with Proof of Concept (POC) projects already funded and underway.

Data on food production, energy savings, and user engagement will be collected to refine the model.\n\nGoal: Facilitate Financial Inclusion\n•\tSmart Contract Development: Design and deploy smart contracts for registration, PyraPOD acquisition, and data collection, enabling families to own PyraPODs through a structured financial model using smart contracts and tokenomics.\n•\tNFT-based Ownership Model: Implement an NFT-based system to track and manage PyraPOD assets, fostering transparency and accountability.\n\n🌲Phase 2: Community Engagement and Expansion\n\nGoal: Promote Renewable Energy Adoption\n•\tPlatform Development: Create a user-friendly digital platform for registration, monitoring, and community collaboration. Integrate AI-driven data collection and reporting systems to optimize PyraPOD performance.\n•\tDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and NFTs: Utilize these technologies to engage communities in renewable energy projects.\n\nGoal: Strengthen Community Empowerment\n•\tPartnership Building: Engage with local councils, NGOs, and industry partners to expand the PyraPOD network. Collaborate with stakeholders to refine the financial model and community incentives.\n•\tCollaboration Platform: Develop a platform to connect innovators, leaders, and community members in sustainable energy projects.\n\n🌲Phase 3: Scale and Impact\nGoal: Global Deployment\n•\tExpand the PyraPOD Initiative: Target international markets, focusing on regions vulnerable to climate change. Leverage blockchain technology for cross-border collaboration and investment.\n•\tImpact Assessment: Conduct comprehensive assessments to measure improvements in food security, energy efficiency, and community resilience.\n\nGoal: Engage with Carbon Markets\n•\tCarbon Metrics Integration: Incorporate carbon metrics and engage with the carbon credits market to further promote environmental sustainability and to reward participant families.\n\n🌲Credentials\nThe Family Food Bank project is led by Richard Nelson, an innovative leader in sustainable technology and the inventor of SolaRoof Technology. Richard's extensive experience in the OpenSource community is demonstrated through his collaborations and his commitment to advancing humanitarian innovations. \n\nHis collaborative efforts include working with ENVIENTA on the SolaRoof PyraPOD initiative and expanding partnerships with organizations like PyraPOD Global Inc., his flagship OpenSource commercialization partner. \n\nRichard's pioneering work, such as the development of the BubblePOD shelter system and the PyraPOD, underscores his dedication to providing sustainable solutions to address global food, water, and energy challenges. \n\nRichard's innovative strategies and partnerships with CoMissioner Rolf Helberg in Norway, as well as his ongoing work in China, exemplify his leadership in creating a cooperative global enterprise network.\n\n🌲Progress To-date\nThe Family Food Bank project has made significant strides in laying the groundwork for its mission to enhance food security and community resilience. The project is currently in the Alpha Phase, with Proof of Concept (POC) projects already funded and underway. These projects focus on validating and refining the PyraPOD technology and sustainable practices. \n\nThe initial success of these Alpha projects has established a strong foundation for the upcoming Beta Phase, which will involve a limited product launch for field testing. Funding for the Web3 platform required for the Beta Phase is being sought to facilitate tokenomics development and a network structure capable of managing the PyraPOD Beta Phase cohort. \n\nRichard Nelson's \"Circular Water\" White Paper, published in 2022, outlines the project's strategy for grassroots, hyper-local food production aimed at ending hunger.

Governed as a federated DAO of Local Bloom nodes, we've built communities around the world since 2008, through regional food security, Indigenous solidarity, and alternative economies. [https://bloomnetwork.earth](https://bloomnetwork.earth/).\n\n👋🏽 We are 33 Local Bloom hubs across 11 countries, and 30,000+ people on the ground. We've jumpstarted over 7,000 local urban and agroecology farms worldwide, 400+ community enterprises, and built permanent foundations for regenerative cultures. Our members have deep knowledge of how to achieve climate adaptation and watershed restoration, with decades of experience building local economies.\n\n**The problem:** Community-led economic development tends to be invisible to philanthropy and social impact investing, because it is inherently collaborative, multi-issue, and builds power laterally. We estimate the scale of this problem to reach over 100M people and $1T in potential community-owned revenue.\n\n**The solution: Local Action Rewards is a unique RPGF protocol that incentivizes real world communities to share their knowledge to finance their labor and scale bioregional innovation.**\n\n[![5.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xjw3tw9R/5.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V5FtNHrr)\n\n*pictured: Broadfield Enterprises, Uganda, food security and African economic sovereignty*\n\n# Cooperative Patronage Token on Celo on the Superchain\n\nThis builds on our existing Local Action Rewards protocol.\n\n🌸 How it works now:\n\n-   **Earn FLO (Flowers) / [X token]**: Local Bloom members earn FLO by documenting the outcomes of their community actions.\n\n-  **Impact Reporting Interface:** A user-friendly web2 UI allows rich image uploading and social networking features. The public can easily read about the actions, allowing peers to learn and improve their own impact. Our social network, combining features of LinkedIn, Facebook, and Discord, supports effective mobilization around what is working well for climate adaptation and repair. \n\n-   **Grants Distribution**: A verifier (increasingly local as we scale) reviews the report for completion and truthfulness. FLO is issued using [Inverter Network's](https://www.inverter.network/) bounties contracts. Grants are then distributed based on FLO earned, benefiting individuals and local treasuries. [Details.](https://bloomnetwork.earth/view/announcement-local-action-rewards-942c6454c17d)\n\nThe local treasury can be used to pay a stipend to community organizers, venue rental, farm equipment, or invest in a local business. It's up to each Local community to self-manage their treasury.\n\nGrants, as well as profits as the coop becomes profitable, are routed to the members on the ground who are doing the kinds of place-based labor that humanity needs to massively scale to mitigate climate impacts and solve common societal problems.\n\nIt's worth noting that we have already workshopped the legal side of our approach, with an all-female legal team, using the Colorado Limited Cooperative Association in tandem with a US-based 501(c)3, to reduce risk for existing real world communities who are new adopters of Web3.\n\nBenefits of this approach:\n\n- 🎡 **Kickstart flywheels for bioregional regenerative economies**, by issuing capital to communities that have limited access to any other means of obtaining it.\n\n- 🌿 **De-risk philanthropic contributions**, by documenting the impact before payment is issued.\n\n- 💸 **Low international remittance fees** via stablecoin payouts enable micro payments at scale on globally.\n\n-  👀 **Makes the unpaid labor and innovation being done by communities all over the world visible, and fundable.**\n\n# Goal\n\n**Sponsors for the rewards pool are welcome. Our community could easily put $100M to effective use on proven local projects that are ready to scale, securing foodways and restoring watersheds for climate resilience.**\n\n**GG21 Contribution Allocation:**\n\n- 90% to the Local Action Rewards pool.\n\n- 10% to platform development and training, including crypto education and development of V2 of our token on Celo on the Superchain.\n\nThis onboards completely new web3 users to Celo as one of their first experiences. We are working on onboarding 3,000 users within the first 6 months of our Local Action Rewards, and scale from there to onboard the rest of our 30,000 person real-world community and more. Read on for details on how we will increase transaction volume on Celo for real world economic well-being.\n\n# Phase 2: \n\nOur first funding round runs through September 30. Starting with our second grants round, we are adding a second pool specifically for Indigenous-led regenerative actions, to address the fact that less than 1% of climate-related aid goes directly to Indigenous organizations, despite Indigenous communities stewarding 80% of the biodiversity on planet Earth.\n\nWe are now onboarding our real world community to Bloom's social network and Web3, automating impact report deployment to on-chain systems for grants interoperability, and beginning to research how to enhance FLO with community currency properties to support local business discovery and economic development, expanding local-first on-chain connectivity.\n\n![community-Currency-nodescrip.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cJY52P2q/community-Currency-nodescrip.png)\n\nThis mechanism allows locals to share our surplus and establish relationships with potential customers. If you're a techie, it helps you deepen your experience with people and projects working around you. This is being explored in relationship with other local-global networks such as Celo regional DAOs, ReFi DAO, and aligned Celo apps that have tokens such as Silvi, Local Bloom nodes with local reputation tokens.\n\n# Impact Since GG20\n\n[Milestone reporting on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/bloom-network/grants?tab=overview). Highlights:\n\n-   **Education:** Prepared educational materials and began onboarding our 30,000-person community onto Web3 via Bloom Network. Developed a Needs Assessment survey to help Local Bloom nodes write grants.\n\n-   **Impact Reporting Interoperability:** Coded an API to pull impact reports from Bloom Network into Karma GAP, aiding Local Bloom projects in securing additional funding.\n\n-   **Local Blooms' Impact:** Broadfield Enterprises Uganda [obtained EU and US organic certifications](https://bloomnetwork.earth/view/beu-organic-vanilla--376e25c4c1c1).

Every dollar supports grassroots projects restoring ecosystems, regenerating economies, and empowering local leaders.\n\n# Real-World Impact 🌱\n\nSince 2008, Bloom has grown into a **global movement**, engaging **30,000+ people across 32 hubs in 13 countries**. We've helped:\n✅ **7,000+ urban and agroecology farms** take root\n✅ **1,000+ community enterprises launch**, from co-ops to small businesses\n✅ **400+ watershed restoration projects** protect ecosystems\n✅ **4 thriving bioregional economies** grow\n\nIn the past six months alone, Bloomers have created **230 new wallets** and completed **290 verified bounties** for real-world community action. \n\n\n***\n\n# 🌻 How Your Contribution Helps\n\nBloom connects local climate action with a unique, community-oriented implementation of Web3 bounties, to scale impact and fund grassroots solutions. Your support helps:\n\n* **Onboard first-time users to Web3**\n* **Power local media feeds** – making it easy to discover & participate in community projects while making friends\n* Bloomers **share impact stories** via [**incentivized, image-rich impact reporting**](https://bloomnetwork.earth/member/localactionrewards), inspiring action & peer learning \n* **Equip grassroots leaders** with mentorship, guidance & operational support\n* **Grow local treasuries**, financing grassroots development\n\n📖  [Read the impact reports here](https://bloomnetwork.earth/communityposts)!  Bloom impact reports automatically post to Karma GAP, reducing the reporting burden for busy local leaders.\n\n***\n\n# 🌟 Local Action Rewards – Quarterly Grant Pool\n\n**Our approach incentivizes Bloomers to share their impact work, learn from one another, and build healthy bioregional economies.** \n\nSince Summer 2024, **we've distributed $12,000 per quarter, with a goal of scaling 1,000x**. This funding supports local revenue streams in agroforestry, soil regeneration, and community care while ensuring “invisible labor” is seen and compensated. This labor is critical to community-building and economic transformation, yet rarely funded in the dominant economy. \n\n***\n\n# 💰 2025 Milestones\n\n80% of contributions to this Gitcoin grant go to the Local Action Rewards pool! The remaining 20% will go to operations teams to:\n\n* **Expanding outreach & visibility** to bring more people into the movement. Our goal is to grow to 100 local Blooms and 1,000 members this year\n* **Integrating impact report reviews into our app** and out of google sheets for more streamlined, timely delivery to authors\n* **Upgrading our integration with Karma GAP** to use the Common Impact Data Standard\n\n📢 **Coming Soon!** Bloom Blossoms Podcast: “How to Do a Needs Assessment” - Practical guidance for grassroots organizers!\n\n***\n\n# 🚀 Why Bloom?\nOur team is **both local community organizers and technologists**. We build tools that real-world leaders **actually need**  and can effectively use in their daily work.\n\n# 🔗 Support Grassroots Action!\n✅ Donate via Gitcoin Grants and share this grant listing\n✅ Follow our work: [bloomnetwork.earth](https://bloomnetwork.earth)\n📌 **Together, we’re bringing the next billion people on-chain - while regenerating the planet.**\n\n![localblooms](https://i.ibb.co/sdHrH9mp/gg-Grants-Still.png)\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"BloomNetwork","projectTwitter":"ourbloomnetwork"},"metadataCid":"bafkreidmc42qn3e4pm6ci5a4odsuugszl2vrypk2gkb4tbdukk7g6iaoj4","timestamp":"2024-08-07T13:25:11+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x5219ffb88175588510e9752A1ecaA3cd217ca783","createdAtBlock":27073013}],"projectId":"0x85320d89f5661d267d5d03a8d00bd9e28b14808bdceefcbe67a330084d64bb88","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-07T13:44:59.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27073250"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-13T09:13:31.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27173664"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27174162,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-07T13:44:59+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0xCFA6A3b205AA7CEF9EF6118187af0CdEca7E8EA7","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27027018,"createdByAddress":"0x629d4845E066045c39B3538Ff7c2A7317cbF0eC5","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"39","metadata":{"signature":"0x365833f531071fadbf181b0ee4cab5373584e69054aea9a369f6b3082bccccce4699f49398c4cde79360d3b2c889b12764cf3a22c37b9affcb6339095a92721e1b","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"OW4Jtt07Vo1f5ZF4OsYBB2L/0Cc76dCYC+A1Kznvc6vyqQNXUChlpvGnYdcHfQiP","encryptedSymmetricKey":"d9559b4497f74525e9ff8d36216ef194ed5c268976d8da077f1c9f45ec566bfba1e2e20ee3a8b063dd49c6ad160fb21622c8ae99b4e15a283a582f8d51ebc8e39074286871c9d689b33a4916d215dfc37a3a87da36b3bcd604bddc69cc2db993ed6653ca579dbac9258ff525e8e65654887c31a3377ac0c9656829bad17038970000000000000020bb96cabbf87ea53452ecbdc97dd4bf8b1c458b69d671b5333d6d1e806794a56d67544d356d9488d2995f26f9e6e16eaa"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Grants","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"4","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Basic electricity for the Global South","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0x82f66b7fe5958b0e821a845b5f6b26389967754c0f480ec5f7f2e836b983aa6c","title":"TAS(Tech and Sun)","logoImg":"bafkreihtuvpzwp2grhfsen6mufxatg4lf3z774mb6y3fq3e56jdlte43dy","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreid6mi3ytyo36wyql7u4bhxgsqutqc4isriskgp3z374nqr526i63e","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://techandsun.xyz","bannerImg":"bafkreieq62f6pi43qqv4k2nvk5skufgihdn3aewix5fttinillohq7aaqi","createdAt":1710193635734,"credentials":{},"description":"This is an initiative by GreenPill Nigeria, M3tering Protocol and Decentralized Exchange LTD.

According to the UNEP, approximately 1.9 billion trees are planted yearly, yet approx. 15 billion are cut down each year. We Are losing forests at a rate equivalent to 27 soccer fields per minute! \n\n**Impact Transparency**\n\nThe impact sector faces criticism for not providing enough transparency. Peer reviewed studies have shown that donations increase by 52% within 1 year when nonprofits become transparent. The amount of funds on the sidelines, not funding what matters could make all the difference for the climate crisis. \n\n### 🌳 HOW WE'RE SOLVING IT 🌳\n\n### Proof of Plant\n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/J43g2Z1p/Proof-of-Plant.png)\n\nThe only way to create the $MGRO token is through Proof of Plant. Tree planters onboard through account abstraction, learn how to plant & film the mangrove trees, film the land before & after planting in our DApp with GPS captured, then submit the data inside our DApp on their mobiles. \n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/4NypnJSB/Mockups-1-3.png)\n\nTreegen DAO members then verify AI tree counted videos with GPS coordinates captured while filming in DApp. 1/6th of an $MGRO token is minted after this initial plant & another 1/6th is issued every 6 months over the course of 3 years. 95% of $MGRO tokens & retro rewards goes to the tree planters & 5% goes to the validators. \n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/QxRztRCK/download-4.gif)\n\nSimilar to Proof of Stake, $TGN token holders stake their governance token to verify the videos, assisted by AI tree counting. There are always multiple verifiers. If maliciously or carelessly approved or rejected, the DAO member will have their TGN slashed for accountability. \n\n![download](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmr3zcw/Untitled-design-8.gif)\n\n### Non-Fungible Updates (NFU)\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/W3xQzSsn/download-14.gif)\n\n\nEvery verified video becomes viewable on the Treegens DAO map as a Non-Fungible Update video, powered by LivePeer. In order for companies or individuals to make an ecological claim that they funded trees, they buy these NFT videos with $MGRO tokens, which burns / retires $MGRO.\n\n### 🌳 EXPONENTIAL REGENERATION 🌳\n\nTreegens DAO was designed to **scale** tree planting around the world. We will achieve exponential regeneration through carbon forwards. As an organisation we will be planting mangroves and sell the future value of the carbon credits as forwards. These forward funds are at a discounted rate yet still an order of magnitude more than it what it costs to plant. By reinvesying these funs back into more mangroves & repeating this process, we will multiply our mangroves by approximately 9X. We will also stream a portion of these revenues towards retroacively rewarding MGRO holders & stakers, making people bullish on tree planting!\n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/wxZKgsw5/download-16.gif)\n\n### GAMIFICATION\n\nIn addition to leaderboards, we are further gamifying the planting & funding of trees through the world's first Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Token (DSST). The mind orb gets brighter when you fund trees by retiring $MGRO & claim an NFU. The heart orbs get brighter when you plant mangrove trees & MGRO is minted to your wallet. While the underlying artwork is transferable, these overlaid orbs are non-transferable and will display on whichever Treegen NFT is connected to our DApp through your profile. This is because we are gamifying regeneration!\n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/bJkMt096/DSST.png)\n\n### 🌳 USER-CENTRIC ACCESSIBILITY 🌳\n\nTreegens has partnered with the legends at General Magic for our frontend development & UI/UX design.

On the conservation and restoration side, local communities use a variety of **dMRV (Decentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)** techniques to show \"Proof of Care\", or proof that the funds are used towards sustainable stewardship. Specifically, they upload individual tree images, audio recordings and drone data.\n\n![How Gainforest works](https://gainforest.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F592f10fa-b2fe-4de7-84d7-d47ef5244493%2Fe79e5d80-19de-4eb9-8383-5bbc12ea9ead%2FScreenshot_2024-08-04_at_22.20.25.png?table=block&id=a4107b04-567c-4f7b-8533-32c6171ec503&spaceId=592f10fa-b2fe-4de7-84d7-d47ef5244493&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n*Gainforest.Earth provides communities with artificial intelligence models to measure impact. A global data council then decides on conservation data payments (through an escrow). Every step is tracked through [attestations](https://celo.easscan.org/attestations/forSchema/0x1636b2944b2b3a8d9553323543b8b0d4653915ffa4038c5bd18400fbffc368ad).*\n\n### On Conservation Data Income for local and Indigenous communities\n\nData regarding biodiversity in the Global South is scarce.

On the conservation and restoration side, local communities use a variety of **dMRV (Decentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)** techniques to show \"Proof of Care\", or proof that the funds are used towards sustainable stewardship. Specifically, they upload individual tree images, audio recordings and drone data.\n\n![How Gainforest works](https://gainforest.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F592f10fa-b2fe-4de7-84d7-d47ef5244493%2Fe79e5d80-19de-4eb9-8383-5bbc12ea9ead%2FScreenshot_2024-08-04_at_22.20.25.png?table=block&id=a4107b04-567c-4f7b-8533-32c6171ec503&spaceId=592f10fa-b2fe-4de7-84d7-d47ef5244493&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n*Gainforest.Earth provides communities with artificial intelligence models to measure impact.

Access to funding and technology is a major challenge - particularly in the Global South’s rural and indigenous communities who have massive potential to expand biodiversity protection and commons stewardship, but lack market access and funding to grow initiatives and purchase their land (often back) for conservation, reforestation, regeneration and food security.\nEstablishing standards for monitoring and evaluating climate change mitigation efforts is expensive, with high barriers and up front costs for carbon accounting, oracles, and dMRV to issue carbon and biodiversity credits for climate resilience. https://medium.com/kolektivo-co/monitoring-reporting-and-verification-methodologies-in-regenerative-finance-81d76cb9710\nThere is also a huge learning and technology curve to gain access to eco credit markets, and many existing institutional programs that work with these communities are corrupt, provide under market value, and lack transparency in funding flows and impact accounting.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/257721886_Problematizing_REDD_as_an_experiment_in_payments_for_ecosystem_services\nMost financing is also exogenous and does not maintain value and circulation within these communities, who remain dependent on external economic injections.\nhttps://blog.block.science/complex-systems-modeling-of-community-inclusion-currencies-a-blockscience-collaboration-with-grassroots-economics-the-danish-red-cross/\n🌍  THE OPPORTUNITY\nFor thousands of years, indigenous communities have been protecting our forests, the global heritage of medicinal plants, and traditional ways of farming, producing, and organizing life. They are critical to the success of nature-based solutions (NbS) to climate change mitigation, such as improved forest management practices and ecosystem protection. https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0058. \nIndigenous lands cover 20% of Earth's surface and are home to 80% of its remaining biodiversity. (Recio et al., 2022) Indigenous Peoples have a long-standing tradition of environmental stewardship, and their sustainable practices have existed for millenia. In contrast, development, privatization, and individual ownership models have resulted in climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation. According to a technical review of the State of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities' Lands (IPLC) published in 2021, \"Supporting IPLCs as custodians of nature provides widespread benefits and services for all of humanity.\" (WWF et al., 2021: 8) \nSources: Percentage of IPCL lands in good condition (WWF et al., 2021)\nProtecting and conserving Indigenous territories are integral to global conservation efforts, making strengthening ancestral knowledge and increasing resilience and climate targets of global conservation efforts. Together with carbon reduction measures and renewable energy efforts, NbS alone can contribute 30-40% of CO2 mitigation needed by 2030, helping to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius.\nhttps://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0120  \nIdentified projects within indigenous territories not only contribute to land conservation but also serve to safeguard historical sites, cultural practices, and sacred grounds integral to indigenous cosmo-visions. Building a bridge between Web3-powered fundraising efforts and the conservation initiatives of indigenous people in the Global South, beginning with Costa Rica (specially positioned as containing 6% of the world’s biodiversity), holds paramount importance in safeguarding both the environment and the cultural heritage of these communities. By integrating and leveraging emerging technologies with nature-based solutions, indigenous groups, land stewards, and conservationists can share learnings and co-develop solutions to further preserve ancestral lands, protect bio- and cultural diversity for the regeneration of people and planet. \nThis collaborative approach fosters sustainable development while respecting the rights, sovereignty, and wisdom of indigenous communities, ensuring that their voices are heard and their invaluable contributions to conservation efforts are recognized and supported on a global scale.\n🌊 THE VISION\nTo bridge intersectional regeneration and Web3 to guard precious ecosystems and ancestral cultures. \nTo leverage climate data for resilience, monitoring, and computing for climate data-driven decision making\nCapacity building and endogenous value creation for land stewardship and protection. \nOur vision is to secure funding for this vital project that contributes to intersectional ecological restoration and climate action. We aim to support in creating buffer zones around indigenous and endangered lands to create contention against outside aggression that threatens their land. By protecting sacred sites and co-developing infrastructure in allyship with those communities, we aim to foster sustainability and preserve invaluable cultural and natural heritage. We aim to support and continue to enable the integration of ancestral land practices and “Western” science methodologies, also known as “Two-Eyed Seeing” in Eskasoni and Acadia Nation traditions.\n🌳 THE MISSION \nSupporting the expansion of indigenous-led biodiversity conservation by lowering the barriers to access and co-developing guides for Web3 tech, financing, eco credits, the creation of complementary currencies to build economic, cultural, and climate resilience.\nInitial goals include:\nTo create exposure and protection for the communities using oracles & dMRV, Carbon Accounting, Climate Activism/Education, Nature-Based Solutions, and Climate Adaptation/Resilience.\nCo-develop an educational guide specifically designed for rural and indigenous communities to include information about Web3 climate tooling, eco credit markets, community currency creation, cryptocurrency, etc. and coalition building with other communities and land stewards with high integrity partner organizations in these fields.\nSupport the expansion of land preservation with the issuance of high-quality eco credits via dMRV and oracle partnerships where the investment stays within the communities and helps reduce GHG emissions and preserve biodiversity. \nSupport the repurchase, preservation, and regeneration of degraded land, especially on the edges of indigenous territories to expand the “buffer” amidst increasing development pressure. \n💚 WHO WE SERVE\nLand stewards and conservationists including indigenous and rural communities\nThe land and all non-human kin\n🎥 THE GRANT WORK WILL RESULT IN:\nCOSTA RICA PILOT \nCONTEXT\nCosta Rica ranks among the 20 countries with the highest biodiversity per area, hosting 5% of world species despite only covering 0.03% of Earth's surface. (GEF, 2005) Unfortunately, due to cattle ranching, extensive agriculture, and cash crop production activities from 1940 until 1987, it experienced rapid deforestation, and its land area shrunk from 75% down to 40% of what it once was. https://www.premiumwoodslabs.com/info/analysis-of-the-forest-cover-of-costa-rica-between-1960-and-2013/\nCosta Rica is an outstanding example of a small and sustainable nation that has prioritized conservation efforts over recent decades and tried to safeguard indigenous territories (Castro et al., 2019) however, the country has the highest levels of income equality among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. https://www.oecd.org/gov/gov-at-a-glance-2021-costa-rica.pdf\n\nSource: The mysterious stone spheres of Costa Rica were created by the pre-Columbian indigenous people of the Diquís culture between 200 BCE and 1500 CE.

Access to funding, expertise, and technology is a major challenge - particularly in the Global South’s rural and indigenous communities who have massive potential to expand biodiversity protection and commons stewardship, but lack management resources, market access and funding to grow initiatives and purchase their land (often back) for conservation, reforestation, regeneration and food security. \n\n\nEstablishing standards for monitoring and evaluating climate change mitigation efforts is expensive, with high barriers and up front costs for carbon accounting, biodiversity monitoring, oracles and dMRV to issue carbon and biodiversity credits for climate resilience. https://medium.com/kolektivo-co/monitoring-reporting-and-verification-methodologies-in-regenerative-finance-81d76cb9710\n\n\nThere is also a huge learning and technology curve to gain access to funding and eco credit markets, and many existing institutional programs that work with these communities are inefficient and corrupt, provide under market value, and lack transparency in funding flows and impact accounting. \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/257721886_Problematizing_REDD_as_an_experiment_in_payments_for_ecosystem_services\n\n\nMost financing is also exogenous and does not maintain value and circulation within these communities, who remain dependent on external economic injections.\nhttps://blog.block.science/complex-systems-modeling-of-community-inclusion-currencies-a-blockscience-collaboration-with-grassroots-economics-the-danish-red-cross/\n\n\n🌍  ACTIVATING BIOREGIONAL REGENERATION THROUGH ECOCREDITS\nThe Global Green Finance Market Size is expected to reach USD 28.71 Trillion by 2033, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 21.25 percent during the forecast period 2023 to 2033 (Spherical Insights). One growing asset class, ecocredits, has emerged as a bioregional financing mechanism poised to support financing the transition to regenerative agriculture, biodiversity protection, and other environmental justice initiatives. Unlike carbon credits, ecocredits allow for an expanded and more holistic representation of ecological dimensions and ecosystem service value flows that can be stacked to create co-benefits and more systemic representations and nature-based solutions for environmental stewardship and conservation.\nhttps://shorturl.at/W1TF7 \nhttps://shorturl.at/n6vFX \nhttps://carboncopy.news/features/unlocking-blockchain-solutions-protect-latin-america-latam-biodiversity/ \nWe aim to make these tools accessible to farmers, regenerative land projects, and indigenous communities that have been protecting our forests, the global heritage of medicinal plants, and traditional ways of farming, producing, and organising life, being critical to the success of nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation, such as improved forest management practices and ecosystem protection. https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0058. \n\nWith scientifically rigorous work in ecocredit methodology development, experience in platform and technology analysis, and holding key partnerships, this group is uniquely positioned to catalyze process creation and onboarding for ecocredit issuance and sales relationships. Using this financing mechanism, we aim to support and horizontally scale regenerative land-based projects that increase biodiversity, restore soil health, uplift marginalized communities, and build reciprocal relationships with land and life, human and non-human.\n\n\n🌊 VISION & GOALS\nMaintain and regenerate the conditions for life\nTo bridge intersectional regeneration and Web3 to guard precious ecosystems and ancestral cultures \nLeveraging existing methodologies to financially incentivize transitioning to regenerative practices, holistic management, and bioregional regeneration \nDevelop ecocredit pilots and the foundations to issue and sell ecocredits to finance bioregional regeneration\nTo improve methodologies for measuring and reporting ecological systems health\nCapacity building and endogenous value creation for land stewardship, environmental justice, protection and regeneration of water, biodiversity, soil, food systems, and communities\nAttract investors and sponsors interested in partnering in education, financing, and scaling bioregional regeneration initiatives\nOur vision is to secure funding for this vital project that contributes to intersectional ecological restoration and climate action. By protecting natural (endangered) sites and co-developing ecocredits in allyship with land-based communities, we aim to foster regenerative practice and holistic management to protect and increase biodiversity. We also aim to support and continue to enable the integration of ancestral land practices and “Western” science methodologies, also known as “Two-Eyed Seeing” in Eskasoni and Acadia Nation traditions.\nRegeneration goes beyond agriculture and the environment. It has principles, not recipes. Regenerative solutions need to be contextually applied in different bioregions. This creates the conditions for emergent solutions that increase biodiversity, regenerate soils and landscapes, and improve community health and wellbeing.  \n🌳 THE MISSION \nSupporting the expansion of community-led biodiversity conservation by lowering the barriers to access and co-developing guides for Web3 tech, financing, eco credits, the creation of complementary currencies to build economic, cultural, and climate resilience.\nProject milestones include:\n\n\nEcocredit pilot initialization for two land nodes\nAssess feasibility and gather data for holistic ecosystem services financing to support cattle ranchers in transitioning to regenerative cattle grazing\nAssess feasibility and gather data for Voluntary Biodiversity credit issuance with land partners and farmers\nDocumentation of the pilot process for iteration, refinement, and replication to produce the foundations for rapid scaling\nPilot corporate partnerships for the development of commercial transactions and investments in ecocredit sales to support long-term financial sustainability for the incubator, transition financing for land partners, and funding for ongoing R&D and allied institutions apprenticeship training\nReplicable process for ecocredit development\nPre-structure, simplified mechanisms to channel from investor/channel \nTraining reporting/verification - capacity builiding \nOrganizational development e.g. rancher ecocredit cooperatives and market building in Costa Rica and in global markets\nSupport the expansion of land preservation with the issuance of high-quality ecocredits via dMRV and oracle partnerships where the investment stays within the communities and helps reduce GHG emissions and preserve biodiversity. \nSupport the repurchase, preservation, and regeneration of degraded land, especially on the edges of indigenous territories to expand the “buffer” amidst increasing development pressure. \n💚 WHO WE SERVE\nLand stewards and conservationists including indigenous and rural communities\nThe land and all non-human kin\n🎥 THE GRANT WORK WILL RESULT IN:\nIn order to support the scale needed, Landia and partners will pilot ecocredit development in Costa Rica, laying the foundation to onboard regenerative land projects and train UCI graduates as apprentices in the process to replicate, iterate, and scale ecocredit research and development in different bioregions around the planet. The team will undertake two pilots using existing Digital Methodology Reporting and Verification (dMRV)  methodologies with future plans in innovating on methodologies to better represent ecological health.

UCI embraces current technology, but with values ​​and attitudes that build social responsibility, balance with nature and formation of a more supportive and more inclusive society. \nWebsite: https://uci.ac.cr/en/home_en \n\nUCI has been implementing regenerative grazing for three years through its Savory Hub. Adding to the known benefits of the Savory method, UCI added the increase of biodiversity by giving back between 15 to 30 percent of pasture areas to nature through the establishment of biological corridors. This has increased revenue for farmers, allowed for water harvest and early indicators show an important potential to increase biodiversity. \nNow, these efforts have been extended to 30,000 hectares with support from rePLANET.org. The current focus of this project is carbon with “additional” benefits for biodiversity. The intention of developing ecocredits is to be able to finance biodiversity regeneration directly, transitioning from carbon-tunnel vision.\nhttps://www.suelosvivos.org/?lang=en\n\n\nThe Clean Wave Foundation USA & CR\nThe Clean Wave(TCW) is a community-based nonprofit organization based in Tamarindo Costa Rica. It focuses on 8 initiatives: Underwater, Beach, Mangrove, Forest, and Urban Restoration, Community Revitalization, Education, and Zero Waste, seeking to build healthy thriving communities connected with the environment. TCW has hosted hundreds of events with growth and momentum building every year. TCW has a strong brand reputation, is growing and scaling projects, and is becoming internationally renowned, represented at UN events and conferences. TCW is a powerful partner in activating local communities, especially in Costa Rica, utilizing modern event systems, operating with world-class branding and design, harnessing powerful communication, and bringing an activated international team.\nWebsite: https://www.thecleanwave.org/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thecleanwave/  \nLinkedIn: https://cr.linkedin.com/company/the-clean-wave-cr \nImpact assessment 2023\nhttps://www.thecleanwave.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reporte_TCW_2023_INGLES.pdf \n\nKiBrand\nDaní Gómez is a brand strategist that develops the visual narrative of organizations, projects, products, services and events.

The platform integrates gamified learning with financial incentives, allowing users to \"learn and earn\" as they develop blockchain knowledge and skills. The goal is to lower barriers to Web3 adoption, particularly in emerging markets where blockchain education is limited.\n\nThe Problem\nDespite the growing interest in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 adoption remains low, especially in emerging economies. Many people who could benefit from blockchain technology struggle with:\n\n🔹 Complexity – Blockchain concepts can be overwhelming for beginners, especially those without a technical background. Many educational resources assume prior knowledge, making it hard for newcomers to grasp key ideas.\n\n🔹 Lack of Incentives – Traditional learning platforms do not provide immediate or tangible rewards. As a result, learners often struggle to stay engaged.\n\n🔹 High Entry Barriers – Many Web3 educational resources cater to those with technical expertise, leaving out potential users who want to explore blockchain but don't know where to start.\n\nThe Solution: How ArbiLearn Helps\nAs a solo founder-led initiative, ArbiLearn addresses these challenges by providing a unique, self-sustaining learning experience:\n\n✅ Gamified Learning – Interactive lessons, quizzes, and challenges make Web3 education more engaging and effective.\n\n✅ Earn While You Learn – Users are rewarded with crypto incentives for completing courses, passing quizzes, and engaging with the platform, keeping motivation high.\n\n✅ Beginner-Friendly Content – ArbiLearn offers structured lessons tailored for non-technical users, ensuring an easy entry point into blockchain education.\n\n✅ Real-World Applications—Practical exercises and hands-on projects help learners apply their knowledge in real blockchain scenarios.\n\nA solo-led initiative empowering Web3 adoption, driven by a passion for onboarding more people, especially in Africa, into the Web3 space. By making blockchain education accessible, rewarding, and easy to understand, ArbiLearn empowers individuals to confidently explore blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, and the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nThrough its innovative \"learn and earn\" approach, ArbiLearn is shaping the future of Web3 education and driving adoption in regions where blockchain knowledge is needed the most.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Galaxy-ITT","projectTwitter":"ArbiLearn"},"metadataCid":"bafkreiebaspz6hgd334pcuz3b2j22wmvlvrusm32qkz22mng3nclcm7qbq","timestamp":"2024-07-12T14:18:54+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x85ba183Fb4c16D435B076DDe459dAfc8eFF864d8","createdAtBlock":231453011},{"name":"ArbiLearn","id":"0x931a64a4f678b30b165b845b8622f729a1cdf2d2a7a4f2221a9ee8ba268f67c4","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-05T11:09:39+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x85ba183Fb4c16D435B076DDe459dAfc8eFF864d8","createdAtBlock":27036830}],"projectId":"0x931a64a4f678b30b165b845b8622f729a1cdf2d2a7a4f2221a9ee8ba268f67c4","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":3}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T11:09:59.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27036834"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T11:12:04.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27036859"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-05T11:09:59+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0xdc1CE580E786866a0c8A0bE4CE8364f18a67Fa01","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27051959,"createdByAddress":"0xE8D88DC4E3F13046e778253bf4D82dA8230c0813","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"53","metadata":{"signature":"0xb00edec91aa06ff3980bd9098a79c90ba9a9844ca684befb303ad526df05c0c3411baeab84b6af41fedf746479775e7acf46f14a7210192fdfbfbccf936583fb1b","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"rFuPVNCWFiZj9fu5wBUH1ePhBZSUuDDNgoW+oM+SSnELb+YO4842ROK1Nlxw3Lqv","encryptedSymmetricKey":"ce12efad67d678f621ced7a23369a60f1ca20944ebe442730e439990e13bd4e7f94318c7317378aef7a217de14461318ea9d43e443624d7501d5a9e3024e395c9cba82ede0e9a806889722c35416db8009b14efe5d92e78704a0fd70836b64b499302973d52c9addc4878576a341a860a50a2cd0af215143059495b847a871160000000000000020642c958f1e8223eaeed96b629ac99b0f7989d8b8a9e7e8c9df6322982d0ab85d1bc6cfb9a77e65f0b7d072028306da91"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Team's Own Funds + Angel Investment + Hackathon Bonus + Some Public Chain Grants","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"5","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"CoindPay's user base is divided into the following categories:\n1. creator and fan audiences\n2. merchants and consumers\n3. developers and eco-projects\nCoindPay provides a one-stop way to receive money, pay money, exchange money, cross-chain funds, idle funds automatically compounding interest-bearing investments.

Agape Hand has focused its efforts on:\n\n* Elderly Support: Monthly delivery of basic food baskets to elderly people living in abandonment in regions such as Tarma, Cochas Alto, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Huancavelica, Huánuco, Pasco, Puno, Áncash, and Apurímac, where the highest concentration of extreme poverty is found (69.5%).\n\n* Combating Hunger: Distributing food to families who often eat only once a day, providing essential products such as rice, legumes, sugar, salt, flour, and oats.\n\n* Education and Empowerment: Implementing educational and training programs to improve economic and personal development opportunities.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\n* Donations: Contribute funds to support our food, education, and infrastructure programs.\n\n* Awareness: If you cannot donate, help us by sharing our project to raise awareness about the situation of communities in the Amazon and highlands of Peru.\n\n* Solidarity NFTs: You can also help by purchasing our collection of NFTs on OpenSea, featuring drawings by Shipibo girls. Visit our collection. https://opensea.io/NFT_Project_Shipibo_native_children\n\nTogether, We Can Achieve Zero Hunger\n\nAt Agape Hand, we believe in the power of community and collaboration. With your support, we can transform the lives of thousands of people in the Amazon and the highlands, creating a future where hunger is only a memory of the past.

gets to benefit from the value of the house?) and **Governance (**who decides what happens to the house?)\n\nProperty is a simple system that **concentrates both** **allocation and governance onto the property owner.** Only those who can afford to acquire a lease or title can benefit from the utility of housing, or decide to redistribute it. Once property rights have been acquired, the owner has exclusive control over the house for their own interests.\n\nIn this stream of work we ask:\n\n> What technologies could be part of facilitating a shift in how we allocate and govern housing, forests, rivers and more as a common resource, rather than property?\n> \n\nThe first phase of exploring technologies to address this was through a research partnership for a housing model with Canopy (Berlin), an innovative set of living spaces suspended above a suite of spaces for play, livelihoods and events. In conceiving of a house being an entity entangled in its environment, a collective emerged to practice the socio-cultural elements of a self-regulating entity with steward participation.\n\nWe now wish to build the route to establishing a flow of modular smart contracts as a test of ‘Frin’ a suite of smart contracts for moving ownership into the commons. This next grant period covers experimenting with parameters for integrating contracts for common resource management.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"A core member of the team was involved in launching a land access token on Celo in 2023 (through Oasa.earth) and we would use this experience to explore how Frin could be operationalised in the context of Celo’s merge to the Superchain with a focus on public goods that matches the core innovations of this project.\n\nWe would use part of the funding to research deployment on Celo in order to benefit from a modular protocol approach to upgrading and enhancing within civic infrastructure projects and reducing the burden on new projects to take on contract design and auditing. This will include exploring the incorporation of a Commons Market Maker which would be substantial learning for the Celo ecosystem and also feed back into our wider research work at Dark Matter Labs.","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0xecbb293513e9d1f104645a6adfa636f216648facfed9394405264596ffa60b09","title":"Frin: a protocol for freeing infrastructure","logoImg":"bafkreic564ustndbdtkbapyfqojts5f4w2thzsn3vwpz4j26756cfsfqey","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreifrchcihgqfapkwaoith6fyzlzvlkqv4mxwbxqsymnyynzajyynpy","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://darkmatterlabs.property","bannerImg":"bafkreia5jrbynsof4xvke5dd64gp4wbqbsi54zswcbvp3x657xbqbbxlly","createdAt":1713295559430,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..phx4iHobo5bNaWzT7dFmwIH1kHeqJbGlhECaBEG12LBEalTvLFVwBvKkGhFHWGsCdjrDsKvO-NLGLPCJo1MIBA","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-16T19:41:16.669Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-16T19:41:16.669Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-15T19:41:16.669Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x97B59C2EC4Ac59B5A581d028bf495Fd47C96892d","hash":"v0.0.0:PLddRm9+q4mDoLyYqnJ+0f8IF80RE768zQVVkvPOEkk=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#MoosResearch"}}},"description":"# Dark Matter Labs are exploring how houses, forests, rivers and more can buy back their ownership in the pathway to becoming public goods.\n\nFrin is a modular smart contracting suite for the rapid prototyping of decentralised civic infrastructure, combining centralised databases and smart contracts within a low-code environment.\n\nDesigned for projects in urban and rural areas which are intending to transition into the commons, a built-in wealth-distribution structure flows to a common reserve, sharing value with those that helped make it while allowing the underlying infrastructure to sequentially free itself.\n\nThe aim is to be able to connect Frin up to a range of front-end interfaces for rapid prototyping or collaborations.\n\nAlthough this project starts with the concept of a self-owning house, the modules are being designed in such a way that they are be adaptable to other ‘Free-’ entities such as rivers, lakes, mountains, forests and lands as well as the management of civic objects such as cameras, energy meters or door locks.

This project creates a regenerative farm with hemp cultivation and a processing center to improve the hemp supply chain for small and family-run farms.\n\n#### Mission: \n**After years of experiencing the escalating metacrisis, we recognize the need for a proactive shift. Our goal now is to revolutionize our relationship with the Earth by empowering communities and building resilient ecosystems with data and accessible investment.**\n\n**We leverage DAO tooling for decision-making in our ecological projects.

Our mission is to empower communities and build resilient ecosystems supported by data and accessible investment pathways.\nWe leverage DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) tools for decision-making in our ecological projects and help communities establish regenerative businesses, ecosystem health and local wellbeing. \nWe are working to incorporate innovative technologies like Ecocredit Modules, Hypercerts, and Impact Miner to provide the tools needed for creating regenerative economic models for a global shift toward regeneration.\n\n#### Our Key Projects\n\n**\"For the Earth\"**\nA comprehensive ecological education program fostering environmental awareness and action across communities. Through immersive learning experiences, we cultivate deep ecological literacy and connection.\n\n**\"Kendir Hemp\"**\nIn collaboration with Kendir Agricultural Research, this flagship project supports seed sovereignty by preserving heirloom hemp seeds. We're establishing a regenerative farm with hemp cultivation and a processing center to strengthen the hemp supply chain for small and family-run farms.\n\n**\"Regenerative Cotton Project\"**\nIn partnership with Hasat Cooperative and Raddis Cotton, we're transforming conventional cotton cultivation into regenerative systems. Through integrated practices including cover cropping, minimal tillage, and biological inputs, we rebuild soil health in fields traditionally depleted by conventional methods. Our participatory research with cotton farmers develops locally-adapted protocols that improve both yields and ecosystem function.\n\n**\"Rebioca\"**\nRebioca converts organic waste into regenerative resources through advanced composting and bioconversion techniques. This initiative creates significant value from previously discarded materials, establishing circular resource flows that mimic natural systems.\n\n**\"Istanbul Hub\"**\nThe Istanbul Hub connects farmers, researchers, and community members in developing regenerative strategies for urban and rural environments. This physical space serves as a living laboratory for ecological innovation, facilitating knowledge exchange between diverse stakeholders.\n\n**\"Orman İyeleri (Forest Schools)\"**\nOur Orman İyeleri program provides immersive ecological education that integrates indigenous wisdom with modern science. These forest schools cultivate a new generation of ecological practitioners who understand natural systems through direct experience.\n\n**\"Urban Gardening Programs\"**\nOur Urban Gardening Programs transform city spaces into productive food landscapes through community gardens, rooftop cultivation, and balcony growing systems. These initiatives reconnect urban residents with food production while creating habitat for pollinators and wildlife.\n\n**\"Web3 Education Programs\"**\nOur Web3 Education Programs develop digital tools for ecological tracking and transparent environmental restoration. These initiatives bridge technology and regenerative practices, creating accessible pathways for broader participation in ecosystem healing.\n\n---\n\n##### Recent progress and continued efforts in the past years(ongoing to previous);\n\n✅ Live on [$REGEN Validator](https://www.mintscan.io/regen/validators/regenvaloper1wexza7kxc8qktxqcwrt65anwuxjw8pg0akx36t) to support and secure the [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network) for decentralization, aiming to enhance global ecological decision-making.

legitimacy and veracity of the growing numbers of carbon credits making their way into this marketplace. Change Code has the privilege of working with two climate-science-first registries who have each developed several rigorous CO2 nature-based sequestration methodologies. While these innovative projects are non-profits comprised of climate scientists, they do not themselves have the expertise necessary to build or maintain the registry infrastructure necessary to support their own goals around scale and verifiability. This is why they are working with Change Code. By using our primitives to issue web3 native carbon credits, their assets can command a higher market value, contributing to more competition and price discovery in abatement and avoidance assets. Beyond this, we are also co-developing, together with a net zero real estate platform, an open-source primitive for a carbon asset-backed security that will better incentivize the use of timber and other climate-smart construction materials for construction companies and real estate developers. \n\nOther climate impact areas: As of July 2024, Change Code is currently working with 4 projects focused on different areas of environmental impact: abovementioned solar microgrid-facilitated small business and agro development project in Tanzania, in partnership with the Solar Foundation (100% of GG21 funds will go to this specific project summarized above in the “Project Description section”); a small-scale solar development project for electrification of a remote region of Nigeria (Tech and Sun); a water filtration and provision social enterprise in 7 countries across east Africa (Jibu, link in question 8); and a coral reef restoration initiative in Belize (Healthy Reefs, Healthy People). For each of these organizations, Change Code's platform helps them to determine the impact metrics and reporting standards necessary to architect the best possible token representation of their impact. Utilizing our user-friendly Change Credit (impact token) minter, they then immutably record and verify their unique positive impact. These minted tokens represent the tangible impact outputs and outcomes that their organizations have produced, attested to on-chain in a secure and reliable manner.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"We have recently reworked our infrastructure to see our contracts and tokens deployed on Optimism.

We’re pioneering new financial primitives and tokenomics that will drive impact as the next asset class to be powered by web3.\n* Change Code is partnered with [BCarbon](https://bcarbon.org/), a leading carbon research and standards body and one of the only standards bodies to embrace web3 for their native registry. By embracing a blockchain-native registry, supplied by Change Code, BCarbon is able to offer an unmatched level of transparency and accountability for their credits.\n* Since beginning our work together in March of this year, BCarbon has issued nearly 40,000 tons of carbon credits for soil and forestry-based sequestration using Change Code’s asset tokenization framework.\n* Our goal for this round is to extend our tokenization framework to support the issuance of carbon credits from upcoming methane and blue carbon protocols being developed.\n## Change Code\nChange Code has developed a protocol for impact tokenization and monetization called Change Credits. Change Credits are a new ReFi/DeFi primitive (already in production as web3 native carbon credits) that utilize [hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) and the Ethereum Attestation Service [(EAS)](https://attest.org/) to maximize interoperability with the broader ecosystem.\n\nAs a primitive, Change Credits are highly adaptable to many funding and impact verification flows, ranging from retroactive funding and community donations to impact bonds and structured financing for social enterprises.\n\n## Background and Previous Work\nBCarbon began in 2019 at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy as a working group that has since grown to more than 600 carbon buyers, landowners, and climate experts. BCarbon identified the need to create a new carbon standard that could simultaneously garner a high degree of trust from buyers but also present a feasible set of requirements for land stewards. Though they initially set out to solve this usability and awareness gap in their own backyard focusing primarily on Texas ranchers, in the last 18 months, they’ve received project inquiries from several countries across the globe.\n\nSince March of 2024, Change Code has worked with BCarbon to natively tokenize more than 38,000 tons of carbon as BCarbon’s web3-native registry provider.

We’re pioneering new financial primitives and tokenomics that will drive impact as the next asset class to be powered by web3.\n* Change Code is partnered with [BCarbon](https://bcarbon.org/), a leading carbon research and standards body and one of the only standards bodies to embrace web3 for their native registry. By embracing a blockchain-native registry, supplied by Change Code, BCarbon is able to offer an unmatched level of transparency and accountability for their credits.\n* Since beginning our work together in March of this year, BCarbon has issued nearly 40,000 tons of carbon credits for soil and forestry-based sequestration using Change Code’s asset tokenization framework.\n* Our goal for this round is to extend our tokenization framework to support the issuance of carbon credits from upcoming methane and blue carbon protocols being developed.\n## Change Code\nChange Code has developed a protocol for impact tokenization and monetization called Change Credits. Change Credits are a new ReFi/DeFi primitive (already in production as web3 native carbon credits) that utilize [hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) and the Ethereum Attestation Service [(EAS)](https://attest.org/) to maximize interoperability with the broader ecosystem.\n\nAs a primitive, Change Credits are highly adaptable to many funding and impact verification flows, ranging from retroactive funding and community donations to impact bonds and structured financing for social enterprises.\n\n## Background and Previous Work\nBCarbon began in 2019 at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy as a working group that has since grown to more than 600 carbon buyers, landowners, and climate experts. BCarbon identified the need to create a new carbon standard that could simultaneously garner a high degree of trust from buyers but also present a feasible set of requirements for land stewards. Though they initially set out to solve this usability and awareness gap in their own backyard focusing primarily on Texas ranchers, in the last 18 months, they’ve received project inquiries from several countries across the globe.\n\nSince March of 2024, Change Code has worked with BCarbon to natively tokenize more than 38,000 tons of carbon as BCarbon’s web3-native registry provider. To date, these carbon credits have been issued according to BCarbon’s protocols for soil and forestry carbon supporting land stewardship in the US and the UK.\n\nYou can find more information on the carbon credit work we’ve accomplished since launch at the [BCarbon registry](https://bcarbon.changecode.io/), powered by Change Code.\n\n![web3 native registry](https://github.com/change-code-io/gitcoin-resources/blob/main/Carbon%20Credit%20Registry.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Carbon RWA Tokenization\nBCarbon credits are tokenized as either fungible or non-fungible tokens and tied to batch and land steward specific metadata to create a complete and immutable representation of the carbon asset on chain.

At **AYOWECCA UGANDA,** we train rural farmers on regenerative agricultural methods/smart agriculture that are environmentally sustainable, map agricultural practices in carbon credits, promote agroforestry and permaculture where farmers can plant fruit trees besides growing food or cash crops and learn how to make organic manure and pesticides.\nWe also have a charity which works in our local communities to mobilize climate change awareness and education, crypto education, tree planting and wetlands and peatland restoration campaigns, workshops, storytelling, giving seeds to farmers, etc.\nFor GG21, we request that with your support, we can create a thriving community training/skilling center and demonstration farm to help our community adapt to the escalating impacts of climate change. We seek to build climate resilience for rural, low-income communities with a focus on women, families and youth. Your support will also help us plant more fruit trees in schools, health centers and churches. Our training space is small and we would like to get a bigger place in order to help more people, and also to be able to pay additional facilitators. Our vision is that by next year, many of our Climate Round supporters can visit our farm and recommend interns for our organization. \nAt **Ayowecca Uganda,** we believe the time to act is now to safeguard not only the natural heritage of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, but also the health, prosperity, and resilience of its communities in the frontlines affected by the climate crisis. We invite you to join us in making a difference to the lives of those who really need it.\n![AyoweccaChildrenPinkSkirts](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot_20240618-095236.jpg)\n\n\n## About\nIn the heart of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, a crisis of environmental degradation threatens the region's biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Rampant deforestation and wetland destruction have led to irreversible damage, impacting the livelihoods of local\ncommunities. Our proposed solution aims to restore the natural landscapes through community awareness campaigns and large-scale tree planting efforts. By addressing the lack of awareness and engaging communities in restoration efforts, we can\ncreate a sustainable shift towards conservation practices.\n\nOur project's goals include planting 1 million native trees, rehabilitating 100 hectares of wetlands, and increasing environmental conservation awareness among 80% of the local population. We are committed to reversing the tide of environmental degradation in  Tororo  and fostering a culture of conservation for generations to come. \n\n**AYOWECCA UGANDA’s** wide range of programs provide support in some of the poorest and most underprivileged communities in Uganda, East Africa. We work with wetlands, peatlands and ecosystem restoration to help address climate change; we also plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and communities to fight food insecurity, increase plantations and provide forest cover.\nBesides agroforestry/permaculture, plastic wastes and management and energy conservation, **AYOWECCA UGANDA** also trains young adolescent girls on how to make reusable sanitary towels and provides scholastic materials to the most vulnerable to attend and access education and creates awareness among communities to actively empower women and children.\nSince AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges.\n![ayoweccanursery](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Nursery-GG20.jpg)\n\n\n## Update\n1213 rural farmers and community members trained on regenerative/smart agricultural methods, onboarded into web3, sensitized and educated on the impacts of climate climate change\n34,000+ fruit trees have been planted in 105 schools and 73 health centers\n8 wetlands have been restored\n683 women and girls are undertaking the skills training on both tailoring and hairdressing\n3,000+ children receive scholastic materials every year\n1067 girls and women have been trained on making reusable sanitary towels\nWe also bought tailoring, catering and salon services to train rural girls and women who have dropped out of school and to empower them with hands-on skills to be economically empowered.\n![womenontailoringmachine](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPEG_20240703_133651_8197707277131995110.jpg)\n## Project Objectives\n**Objective 1**\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n**Objective 2**\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n**Objective 3**\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n**Objective 4**\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\nWe welcome anyone or any organizations willing to work with us to make this world a better place for everyone as partners and collaborators.\n\n\n![ayoweccaskills](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Skills-GG20.jpg)\n## Partnerships\n\nWe are so grateful for our continued collaboration and partnership with [The Solar Foundation](https://solarfoundation.xyz) in the past years, financing our office with solar power, security fencing and solar lights at our greenhouse/nursery bed and powering 206 families with solar lanterns (women and vulnerable families).\n\nWe are also collaborating with [Silvi Protocol](https://www.silvi.earth/) to track the growth of fruit trees we have planted from potting at the nursery bed, to planting through maturity when they bear fruits through dMRV data.\n\n![AyoweccaSilvi](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Silvi-GG20.jpg)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe environmental crisis in Eastern Uganda presents a pressing need for action to reverse the tide of degradation and safeguard the region's natural heritage.

At **AYOWECCA UGANDA,** we train rural farmers on regenerative agricultural methods/smart agriculture that are environmentally sustainable, map agricultural practices in carbon credits, promote agroforestry and permaculture where farmers can plant fruit trees besides growing food or cash crops and learn how to make organic manure and pesticides.\nWe also have a charity which works in our local communities to mobilize climate change awareness and education, crypto education, tree planting and wetlands and peatland restoration campaigns, workshops, storytelling, giving seeds to farmers, etc.\nFor GG22, we request that with your support, we can create a thriving community training/skilling center and demonstration farm to help our community adapt to the escalating impacts of climate change. We seek to build climate resilience for rural, low-income communities with a focus on women, families and youth. Your support will also help us plant more fruit trees in schools, health centers and churches. Our training space is small and we would like to get a bigger place in order to help more people, and also to be able to pay additional facilitators. Our vision is that by next year, many of our Supporters can visit our farm and recommend interns for our organization. \nAt **Ayowecca Uganda,** we believe the time to act is now to safeguard not only the natural heritage of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, but also the health, prosperity, and resilience of its communities in the frontlines affected by the climate crisis. We invite you to join us in making a difference to the lives of those who really need it.\n![AyoweccaChildrenPinkSkirts](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot_20240618-095236.jpg)\n\n\n## About\nIn the heart of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, a crisis of environmental degradation threatens the region's biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Rampant deforestation and wetland destruction have led to irreversible damage, impacting the livelihoods of local\ncommunities. Our proposed solution aims to restore the natural landscapes through community awareness campaigns and large-scale tree planting efforts. By addressing the lack of awareness and engaging communities in restoration efforts, we can\ncreate a sustainable shift towards conservation practices.\n\nOur project's goals include planting 1 million native trees, rehabilitating 100 hectares of wetlands, and increasing environmental conservation awareness among 80% of the local population. We are committed to reversing the tide of environmental degradation in  Tororo  and fostering a culture of conservation for generations to come. \n\n**AYOWECCA UGANDA’s** wide range of programs provide support in some of the poorest and most underprivileged communities in Uganda, East Africa. We work with wetlands, peatlands and ecosystem restoration to help address climate change; we also plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and communities to fight food insecurity, increase plantations and provide forest cover.\nBesides agroforestry/permaculture, plastic wastes and management and energy conservation, **AYOWECCA UGANDA** also trains young adolescent girls on how to make reusable sanitary towels and provides scholastic materials to the most vulnerable to attend and access education and creates awareness among communities to actively empower women and children.\nSince AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges.\n![ayoweccanursery](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Nursery-GG20.jpg)\n\n\n## Update\n1213 rural farmers and community members trained on regenerative/smart agricultural methods, onboarded into web3, sensitized and educated on the impacts of climate climate change\n34,000+ fruit trees have been planted in 105 schools and 73 health centers\n8 wetlands have been restored\n683 women and girls are undertaking the skills training on both tailoring and hairdressing\n3,000+ children receive scholastic materials every year\n1067 girls and women have been trained on making reusable sanitary towels\nWe also bought tailoring, catering and salon services to train rural girls and women who have dropped out of school and to empower them with hands-on skills to be economically empowered.\n![womenontailoringmachine](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPEG_20240703_133651_8197707277131995110.jpg)\n## Project Objectives\n**Objective 1**\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n**Objective 2**\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n**Objective 3**\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n**Objective 4**\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\nWe welcome anyone or any organizations willing to work with us to make this world a better place for everyone as partners and collaborators.\n\n\n![ayoweccaskills](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Skills-GG20.jpg)\n## Partnerships\n\nWe are so grateful for our continued collaboration and partnership with [The Solar Foundation](https://solarfoundation.xyz) in the past years, financing our office with solar power, security fencing and solar lights at our greenhouse/nursery bed and powering 206 families with solar lanterns (women and vulnerable families).\n\nWe are also collaborating with [Silvi Protocol](https://www.silvi.earth/) to track the growth of fruit trees we have planted from potting at the nursery bed, to planting through maturity when they bear fruits through dMRV data.\n\n![AyoweccaSilvi](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Silvi-GG20.jpg)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe environmental crisis in Eastern Uganda presents a pressing need for action to reverse the tide of degradation and safeguard the region's natural heritage. Our proposed solution, centered on community awareness campaigns and large-\nscale tree planting efforts, addresses the root causes of environmental degradation while fostering a culture of conservation.\n\nThe significance of this project extends beyond local impact, as it contributes to global concerns such as  climate change and biodiversity loss. Absolute poverty and water scarcity, education and technology literacy\n\nThe impact of our project will be transformative, leading to improved biodiversity, enhanced community resilience against climate change impacts, and a shift towards sustainable land use practices. By implementing a comprehensive framework for\nevaluation and planning for future funding through eco-tourism initiatives and international partnerships, we are dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our conservation efforts in Tororo Eastern Uganda and economic empowerment for women and rural farmers.\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"AYOWECCA-UGANDA","projectTwitter":"ayowecca_uganda"},"metadataCid":"bafkreiecn55gtosvp42fk7shn5pl5nh7late2nxslfgxaxumm3tcefow4i","timestamp":"2024-04-06T17:03:50+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x0d0c0941e2578da2b9E2Ad03619615f7EeBc48f7","createdAtBlock":198250711},{"name":"Ayowecca Uganda: Training rural farmers & indigenous communities on regenerative agriculture, providing women & girls with new skills for economic empowerment, and planting fruit trees in schools, health centers & churches.","id":"0x4dcebba7be9ee6c0faa15fae4a00e33934bde5cae2515769bd2e0a90b08dc2d9","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-02T20:00:57+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x0d0c0941e2578da2b9E2Ad03619615f7EeBc48f7","createdAtBlock":26991373}],"projectId":"0x4dcebba7be9ee6c0faa15fae4a00e33934bde5cae2515769bd2e0a90b08dc2d9","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-02T20:01:22.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26991378"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T10:51:54.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27036617"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27155795,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T20:01:22+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x237Ca7e3f12e20d22d54A652007415c1c76165a4","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27160688,"createdByAddress":"0x84484b87b57652967E61dff875e694650e767167","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"103","metadata":{"signature":"0x99089b5c488f7600a8f8d6fe44c16e55c359a8a02f7f1c5c1f3b551ac1c5fc321ecf05e50ed604798cd05cdd2312174150be265b4632ed9af3b997b78a0caee61b","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"0rh9hd/128m3Wm1Iqnh2CpHck6BIyYdzElBne6H63YfSd80mjbs5PUpPvcXdQUiX","encryptedSymmetricKey":"23c158595a69529fd9bf933b3300be37443c3a906d0e00c529b700a8bbb3324040db7e77debf31cbbc2f47dc1912711766175ed87605e19ccf0c9ca20452fbc90bf281a502dd904cb403700dafe101446bab2431b56c3596c9ce3af17783d898f11b3088805ead923944726efbd65eb41d55ba8db181d1325c83905406f99a76000000000000002019d635d94b7adfb035784900c00b183d6a66f37ee2c243bc83fef4302432a5cc55181c39ddafb4cd468e39db971f02a0"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"personal funds","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"1","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"The project addresses the exclusionary practices within the Web3 space, which often replicate and reinforce traditional systems' biases and power imbalances.

This includes conducting interviews, organising workshops, and publishing findings in both academic and industry channels.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"vicosvv"},"metadataCid":"bafkreidqs5x5dpyytism4go42545cysryvi2qdro733rbavjxz6odu3y3q","timestamp":"2024-08-12T14:07:24+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x84484b87b57652967E61dff875e694650e767167","createdAtBlock":27159911}],"projectId":"0x520afb1df3c4f76978a583a08eb160d14fa47e0b183a40e176a6c24e09779caa","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"11","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-12T15:12:09.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27160688"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2024-08-13T09:53:56.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27174149"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27174162,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-12T15:12:09+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x264C399Fe962456A7028395C8a2D33Cf62c05831","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27161108,"createdByAddress":"0xf08df83270DFbe26F7bB24ED65FFd7a8568F81b8","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"104","metadata":{"signature":"0x13545c534c121591f15989bd7b5508b808730ee087076a3cebe28989e78fb7a8701f6950b9b38aad9797817c0fe7286aa90ddcb80458060f5c8a30646d8e3c451c","application":{"round":"0xfe353838ba7ef47c31530041f268161d090543ac","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"YsMLhJedqdLikjRCskrUJFAVsWeCncm2fYUbxpUKSFOPtB9xJ2utGnX8DIbUcpXb","encryptedSymmetricKey":"e0d6b4b2aef6d7b652b09e2b84dd1fbd5ab318e0c27687ba6355ba3f89964f280428de2769a391d34aae4aaeea550008d4a88a429857c52fb6977d6853ee39836ef508bd59b4187656386492e1a0cadb9c8dcff577880e5b5a14b3caee0c8dafd6d63c3755271079d93629e6ca541a9749d644fac032571e693e9f7a6781a12b0000000000000020a21ce35f13dacc35f1782f76b8d04b1c6c99b80d7971bd49e758740dce1184424bcc6a4804090a7dba82491bbc9d7d84"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Friends and relatives ","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"9","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"PROBLEM STATEMENT: BRIDGING THE CRYPTOCURRENCY KNOWLEDGE GAP IN AFRICA \n\nThe problem:\n\nAfrica has a huge potential for cryptocurrency adoption, but many people, especially in rural areas, lack the basic knowledge needed to use digital assets.

Read on...**\n\nDuring EthCC in August 2024 in Brussels, we created a village for all the regens coming to town.\n\nIt was an island of sanity outside of the main crowd, a place to regenerate, meet fellow regens and learn about regeneration, public goods and the commons. It was a living room for regens.\n\nThe Regen Village took place in a brand new community space, the [Commons Hub Brussels](https://commonshub.brussels). With our presence we contributed to launching a new permanent place, and we built a beautiful bridge between physical spaces and web3 technology. This is not only an important seed planted for the community, but also for the city of Brussels, who sponsored the event and visited the conference.\n\nEverybody left very inspired.

But to be honest, we don’t think that this is sustainable, yet alone regenerative.\n\nIf we want to see more of this happening, we ought to allocate more funding to this type of event. We hope that through the use of Gitcoin and other retroactive funding mechanisms, we can change the status quo and invest more, as a community, towards regenerative events and building new commons wherever we land as a community.\n\n## Photos\n[Find all the photos in the Photo

**We need your help!** 📢 \n**We are still €33,651 in the red for having organized the Regen Village. Read on...**\n\nDuring EthCC in Brussels in August 2024, we created a village for all the regens coming to town.\n\nIt was an island of sanity outside of the main crowd, a place to regenerate, meet fellow regens and learn about regeneration, public goods and the commons. It was a living room for regens.\n\nThe Regen Village took place in a brand new community space, the [Commons Hub Brussels](https://commonshub.brussels). With our presence we contributed to launching a new permanent place, and we built a beautiful bridge between physical spaces and web3. This is not only an important seed planted for the community, but also for the city of Brussels, who sponsored the event and visited the conference.\n\nEverybody left very inspired. It was not just another side event. It was something different that touched everyone who came by.\n\n[![Regen Village Video Sizzle ](https://docs.regensunite.earth/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fimage%3FgoogleDocId%3D14Xq2ORWa-MtsxI67vovVAEYMQ8agkaZTI5uzPBFpfsk%26imageHash%3Df38a670104e74ca8f16e7428f2463d24&w=3840&q=75)](https://youtu.be/FSCi_173Alw)\n(youtube link: [https://youtu.be/FSCi_173Alw](https://youtu.be/FSCi_173Alw))\n\nWe offered CELO a free sponsorship and free use of the space in front of the Commons Hub for their waffle and flowers (+ electricity).\n\n![](https://docs.regensunite.earth/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fimage%3FgoogleDocId%3D14Xq2ORWa-MtsxI67vovVAEYMQ8agkaZTI5uzPBFpfsk%26imageHash%3Dd7ce037a8df01828f91bcf0d60d92ac9&w=2048&q=75)\n\n![](https://docs.regensunite.earth/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fimage%3FgoogleDocId%3D14Xq2ORWa-MtsxI67vovVAEYMQ8agkaZTI5uzPBFpfsk%26imageHash%3D67f95ae5c58ae877e88e1c0d678c26a0&w=2048&q=75)\n\n## Featured tweets\n- https://x.com/Celo/status/1810965296892805461 \n- https://x.com/Celo/status/1813336133532811307 \n- https://twitter.com/dOrg_tech/status/1817951128379654447\n- https://twitter.com/RegenToken/status/1810937747130945733 \n- https://twitter.com/xdamman/status/1811070467471450515 \n- https://twitter.com/0xSkyMine/status/1816210985180651662\n- https://twitter.com/dgetsylver/status/1810737024955208060\n\n## Links\n- [Twitter thread summarizing the event](https://x.com/regensunite/status/1813920871091999144).\n- [Program of the week](https://regenvillage.brussels)\n- [Photo gallery](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPBX9GBhQtpwJr_RSlI68I93y1C2r2Bq8x_9AML099o_1kyr-gr71iNGN1rIqCUBg?pli=1&key=aEZJRDhjTDBPRDJQaHdFZXVhWGxFYUxMb3ZlRmVR)\n- [Regen Village Videos Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSCi_173Alw&list=PLGWVbDCsjn0jivWTsKYeIHey6gv_0kTv0)\n\n![Regen Map](https://docs.regensunite.earth/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fimage%3FgoogleDocId%3D14Xq2ORWa-MtsxI67vovVAEYMQ8agkaZTI5uzPBFpfsk%26imageHash%3D7af3dbad90dc0f6632a71af3f6b56d06&w=3840&q=75)\n\n## In numbers\n- 604 wristbands activated\n- 305 POAPs claimed\n- 1,383 transactions\n- 7,823 [$RegenBXL tokens issued](https://basescan.org/token/0x9e179257BE653C56F734Ad0bE8C59503592309Eb)\n- 161 participants have received more than 10 tokens\n- 11 participants have received more than 100 tokens\n\n# Financial situation\nThis was a community initiative, bottom up.

But to be honest, we don’t think that this is sustainable, yet alone regenerative.\n\nIf we want to see more of this happening, we ought to allocate more funding to this type of event. We hope that through the use of Gitcoin and other retroactive funding mechanisms, we can change the status quo and invest more, as a community, towards regenerative events and building new commons wherever we land as a community.\n\n# Photos\n[Find all the photos in the Photo

Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"1. Helping Web2 Users in African Countries Escape Inflation.\n\nInflation is a big challenge in many African countries, eroding the value of local fiat currencies and making it difficult for people to save and plan for the future. By saving in crypto stablecoins through Bitsave, users can protect their savings from inflationary pressures. Stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT are pegged to the value of the US dollar, providing a stable store of value that is less susceptible to the volatility and inflation of local currencies.\n\n\n2. Making the Dollar Easily Accessible: The traditional process for opening USD accounts with the banks takes 9 steps including getting 3 DC account holders to reference your forms.\n\nBitsave simplifies the process of accessing US dollar by allowing users to save in dollar-pegged stablecoins (DAI, USDC, USDT). This provides users with a reliable and accessible means to hold and transact in a stable currency, bypassing the complexities of traditional banking and foreign exchange systems.\n\n3. User-Friendly Interface and Automated Recurring Savings Plans\n\nBitsave prioritizes a user-friendly interface to ensure that users, regardless of their technical expertise, can easily navigate the platform. This ease of use is critical in attracting and retaining Web2 users who may be new to the Web3 ecosystem. Key features include:\n\n4. Simple UI/UX: Our intuitive design helps users quickly understand and manage their savings without the need for extensive technical knowledge.\n\n5.

Users typically save in a Stable coins, DAI, USDT or USDC\n\n[![AF7v-Gr-N-Imgur.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvGCG2Lx/AF7v-Gr-N-Imgur.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V5hKg2DV)\n\n2.

The web3 space is used to DeFi which are investment protocols, and now we're introducing them to SaveFi which are savings protocols that prioritize the stability of user savings over earning from crypto volatility.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IN THE BITSAVE PROTOCOL\n\n1. Users Create a Savings plan and deposit in a Stable Coin.\n\n- Users aren't depositing into a pool like DeFi protocols that a hacker could access.\n\n- When a user is creating a savings plan, they're giving parameters for a child contract to be created under the Bitsave Protocol Parent contract which holds their funds and is only accessible by their wallet.\n\nThis makes it such that every user's savings deposit is tied to their wallet so that in case of an exploit, the hacker wouldn't have access to user funds, except they have access to user's private keys.\n\n1. Users' Interests\n- Interests are calculated using several variables and constants in the algorithm;\n-Simple interest formula\n-Bitsave Rate formula.\n-Bitsave has a buy-back mechanism that buys\n\n2. Users' Savings Plans and Fees\nUsers are charged a 1-time savings fee on savings plan creation (child contract), every fee is split in a 50:50 ratio, where 1 part goes to a buy-back wallet to buy back the protocol native tokens from any AMM or Dex in the native chain's ecosystem.\n\n\nROADMAP TIMELINE\n***ROADMAP (Inception till date)***\n\nBitsave's detailed Development Timelines\n\n**2022**\n\n- Maths and Formula Creation -

Creating a Savings Plan and Secure Deposits**  \n- Users initiate a savings plan by depositing funds in a stablecoin—not into a pooled DeFi protocol that might be vulnerable to hacks.  \n\n- During plan creation, the user sets specific parameters, triggering the deployment of a child contract under the Bitsave Protocol Parent contract. \n\nThis contract securely holds the deposited funds and is exclusively accessible via the user’s wallet.  \n[![create-sav.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MT9RpcyH/create-sav.png)](https://postimg.cc/sQZ1ngHC)\n\n- The Bitsave Parent-Child smartcontract design makes it such that each user's savings are directly tied to their wallet, so even in the event of a  protocol exploit, the hacker would need to get each users wallet private keys to access the funds. \n[![dur.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXzSpx6x/dur.png)](https://postimg.cc/CzM72y06)\n\n- Every user’s savings deposit is tied to their wallet so that in case of an exploit, the hacker wouldn’t have access to user funds, except they have access to users' wallet private keys, this minimises the risks of users losing their funds to exploits.\n\n\n**2. Savings Plans and Fee Structure**  \n- When creating a savings plan, users incur a one-time $1 or less, fee for creating the Savings contract.\n\n\n**3. Break Savings Penalties**\nUsers set the penalty fee (1%–5% of their savings) when creating the plan. Users with bad savings habit who want to discipline them selves to save and discourage themselves from breaking their savings usually set the highest fee. If they break their savings early, the penalty is deducted.\n[![pen.png](https://i.postimg.cc/V5P0vXHq/pen.png)](https://postimg.cc/FkGHnkvz)\n\n**4. Multiple Savings Purpose and Naming**\nUsers can create multiple savings plans for different purposes and manage them on Bitsave; vacation, rent, school fees, emergencies etc.\n[![sav.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wTt1JxKt/sav.png)](https://postimg.cc/N5cGvcjY)\n\n**5. Top Up**\nBitsave Top-Up feature makes it easy, for users to create recurring savings for diferrent purposes; so if a user was saving for rent and they wanted to save $100 every month for 6 months, then all they need to do is create a Savings Plan for rent and top $100 every month.\n[![top-up.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrQrZD0M/top-up.png)](https://postimg.cc/rdwTQ8yF)\n\n## SaveFi vs DeFi .....*Web3 Understands DeFi, Bitsave has introduced SaveFi.*\n\nGlobally, there are 4 popular players in Finance;\n-Banks (Including Co-Operatives, Credit Unions, Brokerage firms etc)\n-Centralized Exchanges\n-DeFi\n-SaveFI\n\nSaveFi is Both Decentralized and Affordable because it focuses on savings and not investments.\n[![savefi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SK3t28Zj/savefi.png)](https://postimg.cc/4Kv1jKRT)\n\nSavings and Investments aren't the same thing.\n[![sa.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tCvwSnX5/sa.png)](https://postimg.cc/KRL04z3k)\n\n- Savings prioritizes safety and availability of funds over interests.\n- Investments prioritizes risks over safety of funds, for financial gain.\n\nBitsave Users are users who just want a tool that helps them keep money for the rainy days.\n\nBitsave users use Bitsave to save and not invest, they want to achieve their savings goals in the left side of this table👇🏽\n[![sav-in.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4dPVtvWG/sav-in.png)](https://postimg.cc/8JF7gv8X)\n\n# WHY BITSAVE?\n\n😌It's easy - Everyone is familiar with the concept of putting money aside for a raining day. And our UX makes it understandable for users to take the savings journey onchain.\n\n🧮It helps Personal Finance and Accountability for Web3 Natives who earn consistent income. Users can track their savings and manage withdrawals and expenses using Bitsave.\n[![sav-plan.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXgBtfjR/sav-plan.png)](https://postimg.cc/RNLt7nGD)\n\n🧐Bitsave focus is on Savings, not investment, there are already superflous DeFi protocols that caters to investment purposes, Bitsave's Focus is on Savings only.\n\n\n## SAFETY FIRST --> Bitsave Parent-Child Contract Structure \n\nThe Child-Parent Contract Function in Bitsave is a contract structure feature that ensures users' funds remain safe;\n\n**Savings Plan Creation:**\nWhen a user sets up a savings plan on Bitsave, they are NOT depositing funds into a shared liquidity pool.\n\nInstead, a child smart contract is automatically generated based on their selected savings parameters of time, amount, name etc\n\nThat contract is created when a user \"Joins Bitsave\", you can see it here👇🏽\n[![join.png](https://i.postimg.cc/JzqTzm5G/join.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvv7FpjS)\n\nTransaction hash\nhttps://basescan.org/address/0x3593546078eecd0ffd1c19317f53ee565be6ca13\n\n\n**Child Contracts & Security:**\nEach child contract is directly linked to the user's wallet and funds are stored in this contract, making it isolated from other users' funds and preventing large-scale exploits.\n\nSince the funds remain within individual contracts, any attempt to move them requires wallet approval from the user.\n\n**Protection Against Exploits:**\n\nIf a hacker tries to breach Bitsave’s system, they won’t find a single pool of funds to drain.\n\nInstead, they would have to individually compromise each user’s wallet by getting their approval for transactions.\n\nFor instance, if Bitsave has 50,000 users, an attacker would need to obtain 50,000 separate transaction approvals, making the exploit practically impossible.\n\n**Compounding & User Benefits:**\n\nSince the funds are stored in individual contracts, recurring savings and top ups make it easier for users to just manage their savings.\n\n**Bitsave's introduction of SaveFi**\nDecentralized Protection: Users retain ownership of their funds, reducing the risk of centralized failures or large-scale hacks.\n\nNo Third-Party Custody: Bitsave never holds user funds, aligning with non-custodial DeFi principles.\n\nEnhanced Security Model: Even in a worst-case scenario, a hacker would need the user’s direct on-chain approval to steal funds, making mass exploitation nearly impossible.\n\n*The Future of Savings in Web3 is Savefi*\n\n\n## GOAL - 1 Million users \nBring a million savers onchain with Bitsave in 2 years.\n\n\n**Bitsave Events and Onboarding Sessions**\n1.

We are building a **real life impact** coordination game in which users can receive rewards for verifying georreferenced trees with their phones. Each specimen is characterized and photographed alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you **become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree**!\nWith the funds raised we will help landowners finance the **protection of endangered Forest** with **reforestation**, verification of **carbon credits** from the forests and the creation of quality **digital content & data** to add value to the tokens, content like:\n\n* **Georeferenced images and interactive mapping**, Taken through our Entsnap dApp in a decentralized way and available publicly.\n* **Inmersive UX for ReFi Assets**, to engage with web3 enthusiasts and show the value of each token **as seen in real life**.\n* **3D tourism experience** of the protected forests thus **reducing the footprint** of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to **keep supporting the protection of the forests**. \n* Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for **video games** and/or **augmented reality** experiences\n* **Recording data** from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, **bioacoustics**, video recording of the ecosystems, **climate data**, water flow, among other relevant information.\n\n\nNFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to ***biodiversity assets for the future***. \n\nWe are also developing a new type of Credit Class for Old Grown Trees (OGT credit Class) so any type of big tree can become a way of proving your positive impact in the world and a way of financing its protection, instead of cutting them down for wood.\n\n---\n\n### Which kind of trees are we talking about?\n\nWe are currently working in **Chile** in South america, with the rare species [***Gomortega Keule***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. This magnificent beings are the last one of the *Gomortegacae* Family, dating its evolution to ***Pangea*** times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (*Scarcer than Bitcoin!*)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YsQ5Heb.jpg)\n\n\nWith the help of past Gitcoin Grants we are also making contacts and reviewing possible projects with the Brazilian Tree **\"Pau Brasil\" or [Paubrasilia echinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paubrasilia)** an endangered Species of tree from which the country got it's name! The heavily abused lumbering by portuguese conquerors depleted their population and nowadays is a rare and unique living being. \n\nWe are developing a roadmap of species to keep onboarding, like Alerce, Pitao, Araucaria, Baobab, Sequoia, and others. \n\n---\n\n### How will grant funding has been/will be spent?\n\nAs of the date of this 21th round of Gitcoin Grants (#GG21 #letsgrow) we have raised around 38000 DAI through Gitcoin that we have spent cautiously in development and growth and also have some saved for our roadmap goals. Without Gitcoin this project would not be able to keep moving forward as we have. We thank every supporter and every sponsor of the Climate Rounds and the Climate Coordination Network Collective for its amazing work! \n\nThings we have invested until now and will continue to invest: \n\n**1. Project development** (Priority)\n\nDevelop the products, contracts and DAPPs necessary to ensure mission fulfilment, growth and engagement. See ongoing projects for further detail. \n\n\n\n**2. Vital activities core team funding**\n- [x] General administration\n- [x] Coding and development\n- [x] Marketing and community growth\n- [x] NGO's and landowners coordination\n- [x] Content creation and production\n\n\n**3. Endangered Tokens Conservation program**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvRnym7.png)\n* Tokenization, extensive cadastre & landowner agreements\n* in-situ conservation actions to reduce threats. \n* Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions\n* Sustainable local development & community engagement\n* Research on species and their habitats\n* Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement\n\n**4. Marketing and community building**\n\nWe have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team. Among other things, we have attended several Crypto Conferences creating network and alliances with important crypto and ReFi Actors. \n\n\n**5. Decentralization**\n\nOne of the challenges faced has been to improve decentralization within the projects. Part of the funds will go to improve decentralization each round.\n\n**6. Equipment**\n\nIn order to experiment, record, experience and iterate on our products we have invested in technology like the Plantsplay device, HD Camera, Meta Oculus Quest 2 and looking to purchase a 360° action cam for content creation within the forest. \n\n---\n\n## State of the art & ongoing projects\n\nWe have done so far 3 official expeditions to \"El Hual-Hual\" forest in which we are working on. \n\n\n\n**1st Expedition:** GPS geolocation and audiovisual material for tokenization of 25 Adult Queules.

With decentralization, smartphones and a well designed DAPP we can connect incentives with tasks on the field to discover, register, content capture, tokenize and give living proof-of-tree for valuable specimen, keeping token holders updated on their collected ENTS aswell as landwoners incetivized to preserve them.\n(GG19)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y0udaZS.png)\n(First Mock-up)\n\n\n(GG20)\n![ENTS DAPP UX.jpg](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkzvC_ump.jpg)\n(First Figma for the V1.0 app in development)\n\n(GG21)\n![EntsDapp UX](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19IsTiKC.png)\n(Current Entsnap UX Figma in development)\n\n\n\n* ### Entrees NFT: (NOT INTENDED AS ADVERTISING ONLY AS SHOWING AS A MILESTONE)\n(Mock-up Only)\n  * 1st Collection CryptoKeules - Entrees CK# : **Artist Diegong** - TBM 9990+10(1/1)s \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jFtN92C.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/29hudch.jpg)\n\n1st Minting December 2022 \n2nd Mint TBA\nThis Pixel Art token will grant you access (hence it is and Entry) to the Alpha Release of the Ecosystem UX in development. The purpose of this be able to grow the community further than only the available tokenized Endangered trees (That are really scarce to produce many!)\n\n\n\n\n\n* ### Old Grown trees Credit Class Development (OGT Credits)\n\nIn order to fully convert our protected trees to biodiversity Assets we thought a way to represent them as credits. The OGT Credits system allows landowners to register their Old Grown Trees through the ENTS DAPP, a user-friendly application. Once registered, these trees transform into 'credits' based on their age and conservation status. Landowners can then monetize these credits, creating a compelling economic reason to preserve these trees.\n\n[OGT Credit class document draft - Comments accepted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InmHe8GEGo0ZsklMu_GqEmaQutDLny6YXvMnzo0LTX8/edit?usp=sharing)\n* #### Ecosystem UX development\n\nFor two years we have been thinking the best way to make interact the Endangered Tokens User with their Endangered trees Collectibles. We believe the User Experience can make a difference in the value of a token. Combining previous developments we are on the road to creating a unique experience.\n\nAs a player of Ecosystem UX, you can collect and plant rare and georeferenced tokenized trees as NFTs, earn rewards, and interact with other players from around the world. These trees are not just any trees; they are rare and endangered species that need our help to survive. By collecting these trees, players contribute to the conservation of these species, learn about their unique characteristics, and help preserve the biodiversity of our planet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P4OJ0lj.jpg)\n(Mock-up Only)\n\n\n\n\n ### Fungible Tokens TBD\n\n* ### $ENTS DAO Governance Token - Fungible ERC20 to vote in DAO discussions and other ReFi/DeFi applications- TBA\n\n* ### $ROOTS utility Token - Fungible ERC20 to use within dapp functions and utilities. This Token will be the rewards & payment token within the ENTS DAPP.\n\n # Projects in development\n \n## Ecosystem treasures: HD Forest native species content (TBA)\n\n\nOther type of collectible to learn about local ecosystems and can be used to enhance your experience within our upcoming platform. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ☸️🌳🌳🌳The Queule 3D virtual Experience🌳🌳🌳\n\nUsing Unreal Engine 5 we have modeled so far 10 of the 25 tokenized Queules. The first product that is ready-to-launch from this is the Queule 3D showroom to explore the modeled trees as a virtual experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kC1REa1.png)\n\nWe are developing a Virtual Reality Experience of the Endangered Queule Forest as a product to offer to our holders and also to Scale our ReFi Model.\n\n(Click [Here](https://sketchfab.com/endangeredtokens/collections/elder-ent-gomortega-keule-replicas-e036fd4082ab412a90251c00c6a513d9) the see the rest of the models made)\n\n## ☸️🎵🎶🎵Music of the ENTS🎵🎶🎵\n\nAlongside the virtual experience we are recording the frequencies of the endangered trees through a PlantsPlay device (www.plantsplay.com) as the first approach. Our vision is to be able to stream the music of the endangered trees live, so they can produce their own content to help them stay alive.\n\n\n![ExpedicionMúsicaLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXB3AMgA.png)\n\n\n\n##  DeSci projects to be developed\n\n\n#### Dendrochronology of longlivedtrees to understand climate change.\n\nWith the proper tools and scientific proffesionals measuring the age of longlived trees and its roots can help us understand more about their endangered situation. \n\n#### Seed bank for old grown trees as premium genetics.\n\nBig trees that have survived so long represent the best specimens among their species. A seed bank to support its regeneration is vital for fostering their reproduction. \n\n---\n\n## Links of Interest\n🔗🔗🔗 **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/endangeredtokens)** 🔗🔗🔗\n\n\n\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"EndangeredTokens","projectTwitter":"ents_foundation"},"recipient":"0xCe849efC35A0a0a046E67c76B477c5432E4BA58b"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiemfko3lpont3rq4b7j5fgd6gitxr4sxgv6tc3al5ogmfkkyvovqy","projects":[{"name":"Endangered Tokens DAO: Endangered Trees as ReFi Biodiversity Assets & Public Registry","id":"0x1f506597522a391b7a17c340bfe38611e2fc33117258162a7e83f44ddf1a989a","metadata":{"title":"Endangered Tokens: Endangered Trees as location based value drivers towards regeneration","logoImg":"bafkreidkwj5cwcyj3vcb5xuv27csyhb3tuzbtfoam7cojdrqo2aoq3gcr4","website":"https://www.endangeredtokens.org","bannerImg":"bafkreig5ihcz7j5uwluu7nlf25rvjtzu3f572gtkfaunms2ugizjkrhwim","createdAt":1691815744070,"userGithub":"idpuga","credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..FQUxv20LWrB8HsrV-Veku2VtR2AVbfbHXxYq_Np6ZFGSFVmQt4M1nUfKCrcKS_-nCm8mHKqhm_UTSDqv44o_DQ","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-16T15:13:05.863Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-16T15:13:05.863Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-15T15:13:05.863Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xCe849efC35A0a0a046E67c76B477c5432E4BA58b","hash":"v0.0.0:fCewSZvTQiE1Dwodcfk4y1zlDy29hBJuNmv1s3vDZK4=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#ents_foundation"}}},"description":"--- \nHelp us register, verify and propagate ENTS: Monumental, endangered and ancient Trees.

We have tokenized 25 Queules and helped the landowner finance its conservation efforts. \n- **Los Maquis regeneration center:**  Its landowner is looking to regenerate land used for industrial wood harvesting and residential plots. We have planted over 10 Queules plus removed foreign species to let the native forest grow. This round we looking to expand this impact.\n- **Alto el Molino private conservation Área:** We are working together with \"Los Peumos SpA. \" to incentivize the protection of a native forest located within a land destined to be plotted for residential use. We looking to protect more than 10000 square meters of land and include Queules and Pitaos as Endangered Species to be positioned within the reserve. \n- **Quebrada Cerrillos:** A private conservation reserve in which we have conversations to start a Endangered Species planting among the different landowners that hold the governance of the reserve. \n- **Escuela Chucao:** A private rural School located in the \"Los Lagos\" Region in southern Chile, in the middle of the habitat of the Alerce tree (fitzroya Cuprezoides). We Will have a Alerce nursery  run by students, and will teach students about the importance of endangered trees to protect endangered habitats. \n\nOther locations to integrate: \nWe are looking to decentralize the process of onboarding locations to our platform so more landowners can benefit from endangered trees as biodiversity assets.

We expect to have the first MVP by september available to be experienced in Meta Oculus Quest 2 or similar. \n\n*First mock-up video of one of the 3d model replicas of the tokenized trees.*\n{%youtube A2Je4vC5g50 %}\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X25AXwr.png)\n\n[Youtube video link](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Je4vC5g50)\n\n*Advanced 3D model in Unreal Engine 5 of 10 of the 25 tokenized trees.*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bitYCOj.png)\n\n(Check it [Here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/elder-ent-queule4-replica-0a6e222a40a0413d97bb58aff7ec47cd) as a 3D model)\n(Check [Here](https://sketchfab.com/endangeredtokens/collections/elder-ent-gomortega-keule-replicas-e036fd4082ab412a90251c00c6a513d9) the rest of the models made) \n   \n\n   \n   * ###  ENTS DAPP: Decentralized Proof-of-Tree registering & incentives DAPP & Public Registry Map for Endangered Trees and ecosistemic services\n\nOne of the challenges we've faced on our journey is to keep updated on-chain data to verify an Endangered tree is actually alive. With decentralization, smartphones and a well designed DAPP we can connect incentives with tasks on the field to discover, register, content capture, tokenize and give living proof-of-tree for valuable specimen, keeping token holders updated on their collected ENTS aswell as landwoners incetivized to preserve them.\n(GG19)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y0udaZS.png)\n(First Mock-up)\n\n\n\n![ENTS DAPP UX.jpg](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkzvC_ump.jpg)\n(First Figma for the V1.0 app in development)\n\n(GG22)\n![EntsDapp UX](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19IsTiKC.png)\n\n\nIf you want to access our open beta click here: \n\nAndroid Users: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entsnap.app\n\nIphone Users: https://testflight.apple.com/join/pz1MOEgm\n\n\n ### Fungible Tokens TBD\n\n* #### $ENTS DAO Governance Token - Fungible ERC20 to vote in DAO discussions and other ReFi/DeFi applications- TBA\n\n* #### $ROOTS utility Token - Fungible ERC20 to use within dapp functions and utilities. This Token will be the rewards & payment token within the ENTS DAPP.\n\n\n # Projects in development\n \n## Ecosystem treasures: HD Forest native species content (TBA)\n\nOther type of collectible to learn about local ecosystems and can be used to enhance your experience within our upcoming platform. \n\n\n\n\n## ☸️🌳🌳🌳The Queule 3D virtual Experience🌳🌳🌳\n\nUsing Unreal Engine 5 we have modeled so far 10 of the 25 tokenized Queules. The first product that is ready-to-launch from this is the Queule 3D showroom to explore the modeled trees as a virtual experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kC1REa1.png)\n\nWe are developing a Virtual Reality Experience of the Endangered Queule Forest as a product to offer to our holders and also to Scale our ReFi Model.\n\n(Click [Here](https://sketchfab.com/endangeredtokens/collections/elder-ent-gomortega-keule-replicas-e036fd4082ab412a90251c00c6a513d9) the see the rest of the models made)\n\n## ☸️🎵🎶🎵Music of the ENTS🎵🎶🎵\n\nAlongside the virtual experience we are recording the frequencies of the endangered trees through a PlantsPlay device (www.plantsplay.com) as the first approach. Our vision is to be able to stream the music of the endangered trees live, so they can produce their own content to help them stay alive.\n\n\n![ExpedicionMúsicaLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXB3AMgA.png)\n\n\n\n##  DeSci projects to be developed\n\n\n#### Dendrochronology of longlivedtrees to understand climate change.\n\nWith the proper tools and scientific proffesionals measuring the age of longlived trees and its roots can help us understand more about their endangered situation. \n\n#### Seed bank for old grown trees as premium genetics.\n\nBig trees that have survived so long represent the best specimens among their species. A seed bank to support its regeneration is vital for fostering their reproduction. \n\n---\n\n## Links of Interest\n🔗🔗🔗 **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/endangeredtokens)**

We believe that by nurturing a deep connection to place and empowering communities to seed and support local regenerative initiatives, we can catalyze a global movement of ecological stewardship, grounded by resilient food forests, regenerative fibersheds, and community-owned housing that respect the rights of nature. \n\nAs a web technology, Vivero serves as a platform for individuals to discover, fund, and engage with projects that regenerate their local ecosystems, economies, and social fabric.\n\n**Building and Sharing Giving Tools**\nVivero's web application, built using a \"Web 2.9\" approach that bridges the accessibility of Web 2 with the power of Web 3 financial tools, enables communities to practice participatory budgeting and collectively fund regenerative projects. \n\nOur \"Web 2\" platform leverages a progressive web application (PWA) engine or \"low-code\" platform called [GlideApps](https://www.glideapps.com/) to provide a user friendly interface, but integrates \"Web 3\" via a community staking position that recreates the investment mechanism of an endowment to actively grow the giving balance of the trust. \n\n[DIAGRAM - Vivero's blockchain-based endowment model](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMb8ycVA=/?moveToWidget=3458764585787569402&cot=14)\n\nBy providing a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with \"regenerative finance\" protocols like Giveth and Regen Network, Vivero makes it easy for anyone to contribute to and support initiatives that align with their values.\n\n**New Fiscal Sponsorship and Organizational Structure**\nVivero has recently established a fiscal sponsorship with the Sustainable Futures Institute (SFI), a Minnesota 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, and Roots Cooperative, a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association, formalizing our organization as a transparent, collaborative regenerative finance platform. This partnership enables us to gain greater agility in technology development and fundraising, while also providing a solid foundation for our self-organizing practices.\n\nAs part of this new structure, we have adopted Elinor Ostrom's 8 Principles for Managing a Commons, which will guide our decision-making and governance processes. These principles, which emphasize collective action, trust, and shared responsibility, will enhance Vivero's mission and values, and will help us create a more resilient, equitable, and just platform for community-driven regenerative finance.\n\n**Land Stewardship Projects Funded by Vivero**\n\nThe Earth Regenerators Fund, through Vivero, has proudly funded several inspiring land stewardship projects that demonstrate the power of community-driven regenerative initiatives. These projects showcase a diverse range of approaches to restoring ecosystems, promoting biodiversity, and nurturing the relationship between people and the land.\n\nOne such project is the Plethora Social Initiative Permaculture Project, led by Gloire M. in Uganda. This initiative focuses on empowering refugee farmers through regenerative agriculture practices based on the three ethics of permaculture. With a grant of $370 from Earth Regenerators Fund through Vivero, the project supported refugee farmers in obtaining seeds, tools, and training to address food scarcity and climate change challenges in their communities.\n\nAnother notable project is The Good Place Regenerative Education Center, spearheaded by Charles U. The center aims to demonstrate land stewardship practices and provide educational opportunities for the community. Vivero contributed $540 towards recommissioning an existing well and pump, retrofitted with a solar power system, to ensure a reliable water supply for hosting programs and workshops.\n\nSimona I.'s More Trees Now Mediterranean Climate Methodology Trial is an innovative project that tests the transplantation of naturally competing tree saplings in the Mediterranean climate. With a grant of $125 from Vivero, Simona will harvest, care for, and plant 30 saplings within a syntropic agroforestry system, aiming to restore the landscape and promote biodiversity.\n\nTo contribute directly to the Vivero endowment, you invite gifts through Giveth, where Vivero is a verified project. \n\n[Grow the Vivero endowment on Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/vivero-is-a-participatory-giving-trust-and-endowment)\n\nAll are welcome to participate at https://vivero.app\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"viveroapp"},"recipient":"0x61d9744f1bA7d11503410d4f351ef4eC6cADea24"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreia7gsf2iqgxwsfnm7woxahbjfl4ic5k6tbjmxkagvetvwgxritfyy","projects":[{"name":"Vivero - Bioregional Stewardship as Civic Engagement","id":"0xa22b1284313947ace7fef43e6841e9eb496a5eab6d4b73c9459908c0c232828a","metadata":{"title":"Vivero: A Community-Directed Giving Trust for Bioregional Stewardship","logoImg":"bafkreidwshr3qoskg3nudprlzbnsnyhbkos3ev2e5zjeirpmiyrujmgbqi","website":"https://vivero.app","bannerImg":"bafkreibjmaxtovtv5b2c7v5mxq4g7w6gl37qiga2naa74ywpnujxgj46se","createdAt":1713210331236,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..1McHyCMSPToztSaQCGetFSvMGnj-PeOBXS7fuhUzgCBbymp3lVTUTbl3P0NYtCi62tJ6bMqEZ7epsO-AVFBKDQ","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-04-15T19:44:27.644Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-04-15T19:44:27.644Z","expirationDate":"2024-07-14T19:44:27.644Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x7a738EfFD10bF108b7617Ec8E96a0722fa54C547","hash":"v0.0.0:TudztatybuGmLqu63YaTQ3ZwbtiY/39iqAVQUR//qPU=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#viveroapp"}}},"description":"# Vivero: a community-directed giving trust for bioregional stewardship, enabling regenerative communities to connect, collaborate, and grow. \n\n**https://vivero.app** and **@viveroapp**\n\n**Vivero is actively maintained by a participatory governance council, the Vivero circle, meeting twice weekly - Fridays and Mondays.

the pressing real-world problem of climate change and the need for sustainable economic systems by leveraging advanced technologies such as public ledgers, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, open data, and open science. Our initiative tackles the critical issue of aligning financial gain with planetary health, creating a regenerative economy that values human and natural capital.\n\nThrough our innovative approach, we solve several key problems:\n\n1. **Environmental Degradation**: By promoting regenerative practices and solutions, ReFi DAO supports local communities in restoring and preserving their natural environments. Our network of ReFi Local Nodes engages in practical, on-the-ground efforts to implement ecological regeneration, reducing environmental degradation and fostering biodiversity.\n2. **Economic Inequality**: ReFi DAO aims to create a new economic system that benefits all, not just a few. Through the development of tools like the Prosperity Passport and initiatives such as the Self-Organizing Community Playbook, we empower individuals and communities to participate in and benefit from a regenerative economy. This includes creating local currencies, community land trusts, and participatory budgeting systems that ensure wealth and resources are distributed more equitably.\n3. **Community Disconnection**: In an increasingly globalized world, local communities often feel disconnected and disempowered. ReFi Local Nodes bridge this gap by connecting communities through an online network and enabling them to share knowledge, resources, and support. This fosters a sense of unity and collaboration, empowering communities to take collective action towards common goals.\n4. **Scalability of Regenerative Practices**: One of the significant challenges in addressing climate change and economic inequality is scaling effective solutions. ReFi DAO's initiatives, such as the Local Node Incubator and Bioregional Builders, provide the infrastructure and support needed to scale regenerative practices globally. By creating comprehensive toolkits, incubator programs, and mapping regional projects, we facilitate the widespread adoption of regenerative finance and Web3 technologies.\n\nThrough these efforts, ReFi DAO not only addresses the immediate challenges posed by climate change and economic disparity but also lays the foundation for a sustainable, equitable, and regenerative future.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"ReFi DAO has been instrumental in positioning the Celo ecosystem as a central player in regenerative finance, leveraging our unique capabilities to foster a global movement. Over the past three years, our strategic alignment with Celo has showcased the blockchain's potential and driven adoption and application across diverse projects and communities. Our work has helped Celo attract more innovative projects and community engagement, driving further growth and establishing a solid foundation for future developments within the blockchain and ReFi sectors. Some highlights include:\n\n- **Impact Tracking and Hypercerts**: We have launched a pilot for impact tracking using hypercerts minted on Celo. We developed a detailed minting guide and supported 15 nodes in creating their first hypercerts, with plans to initiate a retroactive funding round to reward high-impact projects. This initiative highlights how ReFi DAO utilizes Celo’s blockchain capabilities to enhance transparency and accountability in tracking regenerative impacts.\n- **Celo Integration and Operations**: ReFi DAO has integrated Celo into our operations across all nodes, including the creation of over 23 Celo SAFEs for financial management, hypercerts for impact reporting, and Celo NFT collections. We support the development of further tools on Celo, such as working with Karma GAP to deploy their platform on Celo and onboard our community.

This includes:\n\n- **MycoFi for Municipal Resilience**: Led by ReFi DAO Core Steward and “MycoFi” co-creator Scott Morris alongside a dozen social and regenerative finance industry veterans, this initiative seeks to research various mechanisms and strategies for creating resilience and antifragility in place based economies on the municipal and community levels, and contextualize those into a playbook for local policy makers, economic developers, funders, and Local Node organizers. It expects to build out this resource in a way that adds to the Local Node Toolkit and aligned contexts across the web3 for good space.\n- **Bioregional Builders**: Co-led by stakeholders from OpenCivics, Celo, and ReFi DAO, the Bioregional Builders initiative aims to enhance connectivity between builders, developers, and community organizers at the bioregional scale, facilitating collaboration to design infrastructures that support regenerative economies and bioregional governance. Additionally, we plan to actively support this project by mapping ReFi Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and other regionally-based ReFi/Web3/Climate projects to identify potential collaborations. We are also exploring opportunities to support the first bioregional Quadratic Funding (QF) round.\n- **Prosperity Passport**: ReFi DAO is leading the product design and partnership development for ‘Prosperity Passport,’ a smart account on Celo that features a dynamic dashboard highlighting an individual’s contributions within the ecosystem. Built on Superchain Accounts by Kolektivo Labs, this new identity application aims to showcase participation, impact, and community representation.

Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Giveth’s goal is to use web3 to radically transform how public goods are funded by helping nonprofits evolve out of systems that depend on sacrifice into ones that create win-win situations for everyone involved.\n\n\nThe Giveth donation platform is a way to onboard public goods projects to the crypto space, verify their legitimacy and support them in becoming familiar with web3 tech. Our GIVbacks & GIVpower programs offer GIV rewards to those who support verified public - challenging the idea that supporting public goods needs to come at a sacrifice.\nOur long-term goal is to support public goods projects to launch their own token economies with augmented bonding curves collateralized by GIV. When market dynamics exist in the public goods sector, token demand and opportunities for speculation will offer sustainable funding streams for competing impact projects. This will ultimately drive innovation in the public goods sector and lead to yet-unimaginable solutions for today’s global problems.\n\n\nOur current numbers, as one can see at stats.giveth.io, are: \nProjects fundraising on Giveth: 3,6k+\nDonors: 17,1k+\nDonations: 68,6k+\nTotal amount: $3mi USD worth of crypto.","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"We contribute directly to Celo ecosystem by onboarding projects and donors to Celo via donations and quadratic funding rounds:\nSince we integrated Celo as a donation option on Giveth over 400 projects have been onboarded with  Celo addresses.\nTogether, all 402 projects with Celo addresses on Giveth have raised a total of $981,249.59 - an average of $2,400 per project.\nOur GIV-EARTH Quadratic Funding Round, running exclusively on Celo, achieved the following results:\n\nMatching Pool: 40,000 USDGLO on Celo\nIndividual donations: $44,735\nVerified Projects: 75\nUnique Donors: 797\nLink: https://forum.giveth.io/t/giv-earth-round-results-wrap-up-june-25-july-12-2024/1495","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0xca460772f5ba0840a589d2c19fb7e17ac259e4be884313e3712c06c9c885dc93","title":"Giveth","logoImg":"bafkreibqur232q2t7l2rcbdftlubokfpbmo3f2y2cg3ttvo5ovtbw4t6di","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreiflxdj34ggnjoj3ugmq53prn7ihoj5pnel6dosgzdnzjyx5kyjnqe","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://giveth.io","bannerImg":"bafkreicem2p57zyvvx43xoooivbuvgtuc73wgjeep5nlu4jwi3kfywjbge","createdAt":1722968154379,"userGithub":"SnakeGH","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..TJSvR6yHRE7TH_P7URthQionfhPGBQBgKKqSchVEeqcFHiLwf4aCIlASXQdsfd6p93_05D9rNzKO-R_gN3FPCw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-06T18:11:13.097Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-06T18:11:13.097Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-04T18:11:13.097Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB9573982875b83aaDc1296726E2ae77D13D9B98F","hash":"v0.0.0:fvOHRkFyJ4KwYRoDRxxl3RsizJ/sbDtA61SNhmME1S4=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#Giveth#106797533"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..N_ORPYAtyBmjt6ckyA1JFR9fj1rxVGAfwx5Euqek09xsxkWBvOsAZv4YJ41GddQhFVZfYyxBSvI9gcl8sww-DA","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-06T18:07:21.479Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-06T18:07:21.479Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-04T18:07:21.479Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB9573982875b83aaDc1296726E2ae77D13D9B98F","hash":"v0.0.0:TRwKpyWskzN/Y67BJYl8z80zizpnOi3iYWSwVughhGc=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#Giveth"}}},"description":"Giveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nWe’ve been making HUGE progress so far in 2024: \n\nSince April, we ran three quadratic funding rounds (making that eight QF rounds to date), brought our donation platform to now TEN chains and networks, and launched loads of features, including streaming donations and a [decentralized attestation service](https://devouch.xyz/). We also improved our QF infrastructure and sybil protection, integrating Passport’s model-based detection API and offering [a dual verification system](https://giveth.notion.site/Matching-Eligibility-for-Donations-400ac367ab254cdbb71aec5727b66c49?pvs=74) to streamline donor identity verification for the crypto experienced and crypto newbie alike, and adopting [Connection-Oriented Cluster Match QF] (https://forum.giveth.io/t/cluster-match-qf-announcement/1419) to improve democratic funds distribution.\n\nNow we’re building the [Quadratic Accelerator](https://x.com/Giveth/status/1792903280663621894), growing our platform to attract more impact projects & new donors, and setting our sights on [DAOifying nonprofits](https://medium.com/giveth/evolving-nonprofits-into-regen-economies-f8282f97f8d3).\n\n[Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) is an open source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that allows anyone to open crypto funding portals by creating projects for positive impact, with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Donors are also rewarded for giving to a wide range of projects that cover the field of for-good ventures such as feeding the homeless, funding community currency projects, and promoting planetary well-being. \n\nCurrently Giveth is live on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon PoS, OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Celo, Ethereum Classic, Solana, and Arbitrum.\n\n## How it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond “just donations” with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n* GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n* Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n## Who uses it\n\n![Giveth stats](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/983744449869934652/1270444933601300481/image.png?ex=66b3b98b&is=66b2680b&hm=d813f3adbe87660355819311fd15906e45b48fcf3ed538c1f0503b410b138275&)\n\nCurrently, over 3,600 projects have raised donations from over 17,200 donor addresses on Giveth.\n\nGiveth is a permissionless platform that allows anyone to create a project and start raising funds, and anyone with a wallet can get started donating.\n\nProjects who want to get to the next level can apply to be “Verified” as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.\n\n## Major updates\n\nAs we blaze into Q3 of 2024, we are delighted to announce some significant updates and future plans.\n\n### Major milestones achieved last quarter\n\n- Quadratic Funding: Ran 3 successful quadratic funding rounds start-to-finish, raising ±$199k for projects on Giveth.\n- QF Improvements: Improved our quadratic funding round UX with a dual identity verification system and COCM to make things easy to crypto experienced, and crypto newbies alike, and to more democratically distribute matching funds.\n- Project Attestations: Built and launched a decentralized attestations program, [Devouch](https://devouch.xyz/).\n- GIVeconomy Analytics Dashboard: Built & launched our [GIV dune dashboard](https://dune.com/giveconomy/giveconomy), showing stats related to GIV holders, liquidity, GIVpower staking, and more.\n- OP Migration: Migrated out GIVbacks program to distribute most rewards on OP Mainnet, and launched a [Gnosis < > OP Mainnet bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/GIVETH-from-gnosis-to-optimism) for GIV.\n- Base & Polygon zkEVM integration: Added Base & Polygon zkEVM as supported networks for donations on Giveth.\n\n\n![Image of the ENS Builders QF Round banner](https://forum.giveth.io/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a6e7d0a684a94ad0fa1199e94d0ac84cf73d4f37.jpeg)\n\n![Image of the Galactic Giving QF Round banner](https://forum.giveth.io/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ce42e582ae9e57e7d1e13e8e376a8118dc46c70.jpeg)\n\n![Image of the GIV-EARTH QF Round banner](https://forum.giveth.io/uploads/default/original/2X/d/ddd84d10a2e5cadfb36fda3a3020d7c6ea8b1fd5.jpeg)\n\n\n## Upcoming Goals\n\nThe following is a list of new products, partnerships, and features that we have already begun building or are researching. Our ability to execute on these goals is dependent on fundraising and the success of our economy, so if you want to support the Future of Giving, please add us to your cart and donate!\n\n### In Progress\n\nIn Q3, we hope to continue running QF rounds on Giveth, creating a bigger impact for the public goods projects raising funds on our platform. In addition, we are actively working on the following improvements to our dApp and making steady progress:\n\nProject Attestations: We are adapting Devouch and scoping out its use within Giveth to decentralize our project verification system.\nq/acc: Combining quadratic funding with augmented bonding curves, in a new [accelerator program](https://x.com/Giveth/status/1792903280663621894) that helps projects launch regenerative microeconomies.\nStellar Integration: Adding support for donations made to projects on Stellar, supporting projects & donors from this new ecosystem.\nQF Estimated Matching: Improving our QF estimating matching calculations to make use of the COCM algorithm.\nAmbassador Program Wave 3: focused on onboarding nonprofits and social impact organizations to the platform, as well as potential donors, & help to grow the community organically. \n\n\n### In the Pipeline & Under Research\n\n- GIVbacks V2: With a growing need to evolve our GIVbacks program, we are scoping out and developing a “raffle” style approach to distributing donor rewards.\n- Scale our Quadratic Funding team & processes to enable consecutive rounds and move towards scaling QF to run multiple QF rounds simultaneously.\n- Integrate other L1s and L2s to allow projects more options for fundraising.\n- Scope out a “cart” checkout feature to enable bulk transaction donating on Giveth.\n\n-----\n\nGiveth is a completely free donation platform that charges no fees from donors or projects to use our platform. Our sources of funding are predominantly public goods funding mechanisms like Gitcoin QF rounds, direct donations & grants.

This fun means of rewarding donors is a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n\n* **GIVpower** - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower give their donors greater chances of winning the GIVbacks raffles. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n\n* **Quadratic Funding** - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n* **Quadratic Acceleration (q/acc)** - A novel funding mechanism combining Quadratic Funding with Augmented Bonding Curves, allowing projects to launch tokens with built-in liquidity. Supporters receive tokens for their contributions, quadratic matching builds secondary market liquidity, and projects gain a sustainable revenue stream, earning a % of every token mint or burn.\n\n### Who uses Giveth\n\nCurrently, over 6,300 projects have raised donations from over 28,000+ donor addresses on Giveth.\n\nProjects that want to advance to the next level can get “Verified” and apply to be part of our GIVbacks program by providing information about their impact history and the reputation at stake.\n\n### All-time Achievements\n\nPublic goods should thrive without gatekeepers, and our platform is proof that grassroots funding models work!\n\nSince 2017, Giveth has:\n\n✅ Hosted 11 Quadratic Funding rounds, mobilizing over $586,000 in matching pools and $350,000 in crowdfunded donations, fueling the growth of hundreds of impactful projects.\n\n✅ Facilitated over $4 million in total donations, spanning 100,000+ transactions, directly onboarding 6300+ new projects into the Web3 ecosystem.\n\n✅ Expanded multi-chain support, allowing donations on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, Ethereum Classic, Arbitrum, Base, Celo, Solana, and Stellar, making public goods funding more accessible than ever.\n\n### Updates From the Last Quarter\n\n* [**ENS x Octant Public Goods QF Round**](https://x.com/Giveth/status/1899052639721279874) (March 18 - April 1) With an 80,000 USDC matching pool on Optimism, this round on Giveth supports impact-driven projects focused on infrastructure, utility, and web3 education. ![ENSxOctant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GlrKT7raEAAFaTw?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n* [**Loving on Public Goods QF Round**](https://forum.giveth.io/t/loving-on-public-goods-qf-round-results-wrap-up-january-28-february-14-2025/1975) (January 28 - February 14) In February 2025 we supported 129 incredible public goods projects with a 100,000 $USDGLO matching pool. The round closed with $53,761 from 3,773 donations contributed by 862 unique donors.\n![Loving-public-goods-banner](https://forum.giveth.io/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6509ffed8efb5bc992464b8fcec6b71efbbbef79.jpeg)\n\n*  **Pioneering AI Agents for DAO Coordination & Funding:**\nGiveth contributors embarked on an AI-powered experiment, building innovative agents that will lay the foundation for AI Agent DAOs. Some examples include: \n    * WatchDAOer: acts as an on-chain governance consultant, helping DAOs structure proposals, execute transactions, and navigate governance workflows.\n    * GovPal: keeps DAO delegates and contributors informed by tracking key governance decisions, ensuring they never miss a critical vote.\n    * Grant Wizard (Grantolf): scans the web3 public goods landscape, surfacing relevant funding opportunities for projects.\n\n![AI Agent Experiment](https://azure-negative-goldfish-616.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeiao3sbdzo2rhvdikeopdbqgyyhj5rie6zyhy5eduro4lac4g4fa7u)\n\n* [**Simplified GIV Token Distribution and Governance**](https://forum.giveth.io/t/giveth-giv-token-distribution-update-governance-simplification-2025/1957) – We’re formalized a shift in Giveth governance where GIVpower holders control the treasury of GIV through on-chain governance in Snapshot. We’ve also provided an update on the status of each GIV-focused initiative proposal by the DAO at the launch of the GIVeconomy.\n\n* [**Giveth x PoolTogether**](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wZwefifPKPfytL0rOve1Kg.png) - Through our partnership with PoolTogether, donors can now support public goods projects while having a chance to win ETH—without risking their initial deposit. By depositing tokens into the Giveth Vault, 33% of the yield funds impact projects, while the remaining 67% goes into a prize pool, giving participants a chance to win ETH prizes while making a positive impact. ![givethxpooltogether](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wZwefifPKPfytL0rOve1Kg.png)\n\n* **Integrating [Devouch](https://devouch.xyz) for Decentralized Project Verification** - We’ve improved our verification process to allow for reputable community members to have their say in legitimizing projects. The “Giveth Verifiers” attestor group (which includes members of Metacartel, ENS, Optimism, Octant and more) can use devouch to attest to trusting a project on-chain. Now, projects with 3 attestations from verifiers, get labeled as “Verified” on the Giveth platform and gain access to benefits like GIVpower and specific QF rounds.\n\n* **[Recurring donations on Base](https://x.com/Giveth/status/1880575380836516272)** - We expanded our Superfluid integration to allow people to “set it and forget”, creating streaming donations to their favourite projects on Base. Users of Giveth recurring donations benefit further from opportunities like GIVbacks raffle rewards, and [SUP airdrop](https://claim.superfluid.org/) boosts.\n\n## Upcoming Goals - Under Research\n\nThe following is a list of new products and features that we have on our roadmap in the near and long term.\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Integrate Bitcoin to allow donors and projects to use Bitcoin for crowdfunding - enabling access to new audiences holding 56% of the total crypto market cap.\n\n* **Donation Handler Smart Contract**: Build infrastructure so that all donations pass through smart contracts, enabling custom logic to be added on top of donations made on Giveth in an on-chain and transparent way.\n\n* **GIVeconomy UX**: Improve the UX design of the GIVeconomy to make it easier for users to understand project curation & donor rewards.\n\n* **Recurring Donations UX**: Improve the design of recurring (streaming) donations to make it easier for donors to “set it and forget it”.\n\n* **Cause-Focused AI Agent DAO**: An initiative leveraging AI-driven governance to enhance funding allocation for public goods. Using a bonding curve model and DAO treasury, it will process community feedback, automate donations, and optimize marketing efforts for a sustainable token demand and efficient capital distribution.\n\nGiveth is a completely free donation platform that charges no fees from donors or projects to use our platform.

Hypercerts are the web3 tools track impactful work, evaluate it and sell its impact.\n\n# Where are we headed\nImagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society; where entrepreneurs who pursued high-uncertainty, high-upside moonshots to radically improve society were rewarded directly for that impact; where becoming a patron of impactful causes was something people aspired to and displayed proudly; and where the methods used to evaluate impact were credible, transparent, and independently verifiable. \n\nThat world might seem a distance away, but it’s one we can build towards. Specifically we’d like to see more impact markets, retroactive funding and innovation in the way we fund public goods. In order for this to occur, we need protocols to track and fund impact.\n\n# What are hypercerts? \nA single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that’s intended to be impactful, and whose ownership can be fractionalized and even transferred under specific conditions. Each hypercert represents a unique impact claim capturing the following basic information:\n- Who: Set of contributors\n- What: Scope of work\n- When: Time of work\n\n\n## Avoiding silos – interconnected funding system\nAs an extension of ERC 1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts create a single, open, shared, and decentralized database for funding mechanisms. This database avoids the creation of new funding silos, as hypercerts can be integrated into any existing funding platform, thereby creating an interconnected funding ecosystem.\n\n## Selling impact – moving beyond donation\nWhile hypercerts may be useful for any funding mechanism, they’re particularly valuable for retroactive funding as they provide baseline invariant guarantees that impact claims will not be forgotten. Projects create and sell impact, building financially sustainable and scalable revenue models. With hypercerts, we move beyond donations.\n\n## Certifying impact – open evaluation system\nCertifying impact is a process, and it should be an open and dynamic one. Hence, with hypercerts we create the foundation for an open evaluation system for credible and transparent impact assessment. Every hypercert can receive multiple evaluations from different evaluators using a variety of methodologies. This creates incentives to innovate evaluation methodologies and builds trust.\n\n# Where do we go from here\nLooking ahead, we aim to expand to more chains, enable evaluations with existing and new tools, enhance visualization with hyperboards, create marketplace tools, and collaborate for broader integration. With your support and a growing network, we're building a transparent interconnected funding ecosystem for positive impact.\n\n# The work so far\n- We released our whitepaper (draft): https://hypercerts.org/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper-intro \n- We have build the core protocol and released it on Optimism, Celo, Base as well as Sepolia (testnet)\n- We have build out the marketplace functionalities to buy and sell hypercerts\n- We have created the evaluation infrastructure for hypercerts based on EAS attestations\n- We have created a frontend for anyone to create hypercerts – available at https://www.hypercerts.org/ --> A new release will be available in mid to end of July\n- We have build an SDK for anyone to build on top of the protocol: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hypercerts-org/sdk \n- We have piloted hypercerts with the Gitcoin Rounds Alpha, Beta, and GR18 to show how they can be integrated into funding platforms – you can read more about it here: https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/hypercerts-for-public-goods-funding \n- We have piloted hypercerts with the pop-up city Zuzalu, retroactively raising 21 ETH and ZuConnect Istanbul raising 16 ETH for contributors to these events\n- We have created hyperboards to visualize the contributions from multiple hypercerts to a project and piloted this with the conference series Funding the Commons as well as the libp2p community\n- We have a core community (TG group: https://t.me/+YF9AYb6zCv1mNDJi) with many projects and platforms exploring how to use hypercerts\n- We ran a Gitcoin Community Round with 35 projects in the Hypercerts Ecosystem: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/retrospective-of-the-hypercerts-ecosystem-round-during-gg20/18908\n\n# The work ahead\n- Release the core protocol on additional EVM-compatible chains\n- Enable further evaluations and supplementary information for specific impact domains\n- Build out hyperboards, such that any project and event can create them directly\n- Implement hypercerts for use cases; we are exploring AI Safety Research, Nature Regeneration, Events and Open Source Software\n- Cooperate with funding platforms and projects to integrate hypercerts and build new applications like prize competitions with hypercerts\n\n# Testimonials \n\nJuan Benet (founder and CEO of Protocol Labs):\n> We are proud to be an early supporter of the Hypercerts Foundation, which will bring even greater focus and resources to this important area of innovation. The Hypercerts Foundation is helping build a more transparent and interoperable environment for funding public goods. We are excited to contribute to its mission in any way we can.\n\nKevin Owocki:\n> This is an exciting moment for the Hypercerts Foundation and for the future of impact funding.

Hypercerts are web3 tools that track impactful work, assess its value, and enable the sale of its impact.\n\n# 📣 Update 1: App Launch 🎉\nWe’re excited to announce the launch of our new dApp! Explore it now at https://hypercerts.org and see what we’ve built.\n# 📣 Update 2: Ecocerts 🍃\nWe're embarking on a collaborative journey to introduce hypercerts for ecological impact: Ecocerts 🍃 \nThrough extensive conversations with partners like Ma Earth and GainForest, we’ve laid the foundation for this initiative. Together, we’ll define templates for Ecocerts, establish evaluation methods, and explore innovative ways to finance projects that steward our planet. \nThis is an open initiative without organizational boundaries—if you’re interested in using Ecocerts, we’d love to hear from you!\n\n# 1️⃣ Introduction: Where are we headed\nImagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society; where entrepreneurs who pursued high-uncertainty, high-upside moonshots to radically improve society were rewarded directly for that impact; where becoming a patron of impactful causes was something people aspired to and displayed proudly; and where the methods used to evaluate impact were credible, transparent, and independently verifiable. \n\nThat world might seem a distance away, but it’s one we can build towards. Specifically we’d like to see more impact markets, retroactive funding and innovation in the way we fund public goods. In order for this to occur, we need protocols to track and fund impact.\n\n# 2️⃣ What are hypercerts? \nEvery hypercert accounts for a discrete piece of work and represents the impact resulting from that work. Projects create hypercerts for their work. Evaluators assess the outputs, outcomes and impact of projects' work. Funders buy hypercert fractions and receive the rights to claim the represented impact.\n- **Avoiding silos – interconnected funding system:** As an extension of ERC 1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts create a single, open, shared, and decentralized database for funding mechanisms. This database avoids the creation of new funding silos, as hypercerts can be integrated into any existing funding platform, thereby creating an interconnected funding ecosystem.\n- **Selling impact – moving beyond donation:** While hypercerts may be useful for any funding mechanism, they’re particularly valuable for retroactive funding as they provide baseline invariant guarantees that impact claims will not be forgotten.

Hence, with hypercerts we create the foundation for an open evaluation system for credible and transparent impact assessment. Every hypercert can receive multiple evaluations from different evaluators using a variety of methodologies. This creates incentives to innovate evaluation methodologies and builds trust.\n\n# 3️⃣ Where do we go from here\nWe are entering a world with multiple hypercerts platforms. Pioneers like VoiceDeck and GainForest, developing ecocertain.xyz, are leading the way by building on the hypercerts protocol. Our primary goal for the next phase of hypercerts is to empower and support platforms like these.\n\n# 4️⃣ The work so far\n- **Whitepaper:** We released our whitepaper (draft): https://hypercerts.org/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper-intro \n- **Core protocol:** We have build the core protocol and released it on Optimism, Celo, Base, Arbitrum, Filecoin Virtual Maschine (FVM)\n- **Marketplace protocol:** We have build out the marketplace functionalities to buy and sell hypercerts\n- **Evaluation infrastructure:** We have created the evaluation infrastructure for hypercerts based on EAS attestations\n- **Hyperboards:** We have implemented hyperboards to publicly recognize the financial and non-financial contributors\n- **dApp:** We have created a frontend for anyone to access the functionalities of hypercerts at [hypercerts.org](https://www.hypercerts.org/): (1) explore hypercerts, (2) mint new hypercerts, (3) create and view evaluations, (4) buy and sell hypercerts, (5) create collections and view ownership in hyperboards. You can also play around with it on testnets at https://testnet.hypercerts.org\n- **SDK:** We have build an SDK for anyone to build on top of the protocol: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hypercerts-org/sdk \n- **Pilots with Gitcoin:** We have piloted hypercerts with the Gitcoin Rounds Alpha, Beta, and GR18 to show how they can be integrated into funding platforms – you can read more about it here: https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/hypercerts-for-public-goods-funding \n- **Pilots with Zuzalu:** We have piloted hypercerts with the pop-up city Zuzalu, retroactively raising 21 ETH and ZuConnect Istanbul raising 16 ETH for contributors to these events\n- **Community:** We have a core community (TG group: https://t.me/+YF9AYb6zCv1mNDJi) with many projects and platforms exploring how to use hypercerts\n- **Gitcoin Community Round:** We ran a Gitcoin Community Round with 35 projects in the Hypercerts Ecosystem: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/retrospective-of-the-hypercerts-ecosystem-round-during-gg20/18908\n\n\n# 5️⃣ Testimonials \n\nJuan Benet (founder and CEO of Protocol Labs):\n> We are proud to be an early supporter of the Hypercerts Foundation, which will bring even greater focus and resources to this important area of innovation.

ecosystem to the wider EVM-based public goods world, and more specifically to the Superchain community. This enables Celo builders to access mentors, public goods funding, and other builders from the wider EVM community.\n\n- **Though we are builders of internet technology, there is no substitute for the bonds forged through real-world connections.** Based on preliminary results from our first public goods builders residency, we believe that we have a strong collaborative peer production model for open-source public goods, through fostering peer collaboration. This is amplified by curating a community of particularly collaborative and mutually supportive builders and by curating a highly conducive environment for collaboration to occur, from the venue selection to the available activities to the dietary selection, all optimized for happy, healthy, harmonious builders.\n\n- **Our residencies and pilots integrate grassroots NGOs and social entrepreneurs addressing real-world problems** in the specific context of the region that they take place in. By exposing builders to these real-world problems and facilitating conversations between builders, activists, social entrepreneurs, and local NGOs, we are exposing builders to potential real-world applications of web3 and giving those same builders direct opportunities to build relationships with organizations solving real-world problems at the last mile—exactly the territory where the Celo blockchain is purpose-built to excel.\n\n- **In Chiang Mai this year, we will run a pilot alongside our builder residency.** The pilot specifically addresses the plight of Burmese refugees fleeing war across the border and integrates various grassroots NGOs that work directly with Burmese refugees, who are often stateless persons (i.e., are not citizens of their native nation-state and therefore do not hold a passport) and thus unable to attain basic access to financial services through conventional channels. Celo builders will have the opportunity to interface directly with these grassroots NGOs, whom we’ve been able to bring in through our partners, who have trusted and longstanding relationships with these local organizations.\n\n- [Video - recap from 2023 Berlin residency](https://youtu.be/NXrqTm9UBZI)\n- [Video - What is a Funding the Commons Residency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ToX5EbFLE8&t=9s)\n\n- **Other key facts about the 2023 Berlin Residency:**\n    - 40 builders participated\n    - 15 sponsors/mentors\n    - We can proudly say that one of the projects incubated during the residency and given its first grant by Funding the Commons post-residency has allowed our community member to receive the ETH Next Billion Fellow Award\n","hidden":true,"question":"Impact statement - what real world problem do you solve and how","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"- **In our [Berlin public goods builder residency](https://youtu.be/NXrqTm9UBZI), we hosted a number of Celo builders,** including Gainforest, impactMarket, Good Dollar, and others. These builders were able to connect and forge bonds with other builders in the EVM ecosystem, as well as receive support, mentorship, and, in some cases, public goods funding from web3 foundations that supported the builder residency. Celo founder René Reinsberg spent time at the Berlin residency, where we facilitated mutually beneficial connections. Celo also offered their Berlin office space to our residents, which forged solid connections between our builders and the Celo ecosystem. Additionally, there were live activations with Celo products, such as sending funds via phone numbers on Valora wallet and learning how to build/deploy on Celo. One of the tangible outcomes of the builder residency was the deployment of the [Hypercerts](https://www.notion.so/GG21-Real-World-Builders-f363b5c9b7ab4acca8d52f80882440cc?pvs=21) protocol on the Celo mainnet. Funding the Commons helped facilitate this deployment through conversations with Celo builders on-site and Berlin-based builders from the Hypercerts team. The residency also introduced one of our builders to the Celo ecosystem (Sophia Dew), which later led to her stepping into a role as Celo developer relations engineering lead. It was the first time I heard about Celo, and then it was so clear that all the goals that FTC has with democratizing access to capital were the goals of Celo and actively being worked on by the Celo ecosystem projects.\n\n- **Funding the Commons CEO David Casey is a Celo Scout** and has funneled over 10 founders and projects into the Celo ecosystem to date, often giving these builders personal time and attention to secure ecosystem funding.\n\n- **We are currently coordinating with Celo developer relations engineering lead [Sophia Dew](https://www.fundingthecommons.io/residencies)** to have a similarly strong presence of Celo builders at our upcoming Chiang Mai residency this November. We have already confirmed two prominent builders in the Celo ecosystem and have more confirmations on the way.\n\n- **We are producing professional-quality short videos highlighting public goods builders** and distributing those videos through our partner networks. Receiving funding from the Real World Builders campaign will enable us to highlight real-world builders in the Celo ecosystem, such as David Dao and Marco Barbosa.\n\n- **Celo builders will have the opportunity to present their projects on stage during a builder demo day at Funding the Commons Bangkok,** where we anticipate 700+ attendees from the broader Ethereum community, as well as the international humanitarian sector, and the SEA public sector. [See Funding the Commons Berlin residency update for our builders at the FtC Berlin Conference in 2023.](https://youtu.be/BJTGP_JqZl8?si=FpbDtZRKiGTMDshH)\n\n- **We are also working with Talent Protocol to create a custom sponsorship package** that allows builders in need of a travel stipend to attend the residency, thereby diversifying the talent pool and being able to extend invitations to groups like UNICEF Office of Innovation and some of the projects they are incubating in SEA.\n\n- **We continuously platform and collaborate with Celo for event programming.** For example, at the Berlin 2023 conference, we were graciously given the Celo office for our Workshop Stage and hosted a popular Fireside Chat between David and Rene Reinsberg.\n","hidden":true,"question":"Celo leverage - how does your project contributed to the Celo ecosystem?","questionId":4}],"project":{"id":"0x158ab8951774976a766c75367cc2995b796300ebb2212b4b8cf8ef9f2ffbd9a2","title":"Funding the Commons","logoImg":"bafkreicnmrxqztrcnhkbfz2z7kaefbj3nkufgon2nucoi3rh345c7tjgie","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreidqkgp77rbkxem54p6obkr44d3dxb5hjtbue4rwsboi6w6dudh3iu","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://fundingthecommons.io/","bannerImg":"bafkreifvwiwdyoysluosbclqzs7mnqnhgjgoytl6hyylys5skaxrrhzpfi","createdAt":1699376462734,"userGithub":"davidacasey","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..zK9h17UnIDoROGSLzBSBBZTnyyn48Fr5MrKQSY555kB1_Ox_eYsWIG51qJeGxPuKSZ-fU4_P--1Kp-G_jra6Ag","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2023-11-07T16:58:44.472Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2023-11-07T16:58:44.472Z","expirationDate":"2024-02-05T16:58:44.472Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x576edCed7475D8F64a5e2D5227c93Ca57d7f5d20","hash":"v0.0.0:FNQFRLDgB8do9280TgD0X92Dx7MqM4wlh12Sae049pA=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#fundingthecommons#10065319"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..TZZM6pW6sLzDdgdEBk4Oodw1WbfFJ858wn5H2pT9LVKVOB8AEZmPwJhKlRPRjgYx85ZK_kOl85BOnMbfGLHVDg","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2023-11-07T16:58:19.656Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2023-11-07T16:58:19.656Z","expirationDate":"2024-02-05T16:58:19.656Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x576edCed7475D8F64a5e2D5227c93Ca57d7f5d20","hash":"v0.0.0:X7k3yGIb71xKLLToM1zyN1j24J+e2MH0m9PnQE5+npo=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#FundingCommons"}}},"description":"Funding the Commons (FtC) originated as an event series aiming to cultivate a public goods community spanning across the spectrum, including Web2, Web3, research, philanthropy, government, and industry. \n\nIts primary focus is the fostering of innovative public goods funding mechanisms.

Open-Source. Token Free. Permissionless.**\n\n## Attestations?\nAttestations are digital signatures on structured data, enabling entities like smart contracts, individuals, or businesses to verifiably state facts about anything, i.e. \"I attest this information is valid\". They are foundational for building trust in both online and onchain experiences. We've provided extensive documentation to help you quickly [**learn more about the core concepts**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/category/core-concepts) of EAS and attestations.\n\nWith over **2 million attestations** made, EAS is empowering developers to create reliable and transparent applications. Since you can attest to almost anything, the [**use cases and ideas to build**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/category/ideas-to-build) are virtually limitless.\n\n## Enabling Real World Impact\nReal-world applications on Ethereum often face challenges in bridging the gap between smart contracts and tangible impacts in physical communities. There's a primitive that's been missing. How do we actually decentralize more than just money and assets? \n\nThere have been use cases that have been talked about for a decade like Land Registries, Voting Systems, Supply Chain Provenance, and much more. But how do you actually know who or what data to trust? It needs to be verifiable and signed by an entity that matters. Imagine a world where:\n\n- **Land Registries** are secured by governments or local authorities attesting to land ownership, creating immutable records that reduce fraud and simplify property transfers.\n- **Voting Systems** ensure transparency and security by allowing citizens to attest to their votes.\n- **Supply Chains** are made trustworthy by manufacturers attesting to the origin and authenticity of goods, enhancing traceability.\n- **Healthcare Data** remains secure and private as medical professionals attest to patient information, ensuring only authorized access.\n- **Financial Inclusion** is expanded as organizations attest to micro-loans, savings, and other financial services, helping underbanked communities access essential resources.\n\n### Land registry example on Sepolia:\nThis is an example of a parcel of land being attested to by defining the property type and polygon area.\nhttps://sepolia.easscan.org/attestation/view/0x345567560b051a78d17cdc2669ddc5b859bc6c388b10110f05bb848e7d32655a\n\n\n## Celo Attestation Use Cases\nAttestations provide a straightforward yet powerful way to create digital signatures on data, enabling others to trust and build upon that information. Here’s how attestations can power impactful projects in the Celo ecosystem:\n\n- **Eco Credits:** Validate the origin of carbon credits or other ecological assets, ensuring transparency in environmental projects.\n- **DePIN Infrastructure:** Verify the deployment and maintenance of decentralized infrastructure like solar panels or community wifi, creating trusted records.\n- **RWA Verifications:** Securely attest to the ownership and transfer of physical assets onchain, adding liquidity and security to markets such as real estate.\n\nEAS is also natively integrated into the OP Stack, and with Celo’s upcoming migration to this stack, EAS will be seamlessly available to all Celo developers. In the meantime, EAS is already deployed on [**Celo mainnet**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/quick--start/contracts#celo), ready for immediate use.\n\n\n## Developer tools available\n- [**Open-Source SDK:**](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk) easily integrate EAS into your projects.\n- [**Open-Source Indexer:**](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-indexing-service) efficiently index attestations.\n- [**GraphQL API:**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/developer-tools/api) for querying attestation data\n- [**Celo Attestation Explorer:**](https://celo.easscan.org/) a no-code explorer to make and verify attestations\n- [**EAS Metamask Snap:**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/developer-tools/metamask-snap/) decode onchain attestation data before.\n\n\n## Where we're going next\nOur mantra and focus is simple: **\"Help builders build faster\"**. We are continuously working to improve the developer experience by expanding the protocol's functionality, offering new tools, and creating more comprehensive examples and tutorials. As we grow, your support accelerates the development of EAS and the broader attestation ecosystem, helping to build a more trustful internet.","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"ethereum-attestation-service","projectTwitter":"eas_eth"},"recipient":"0x85daA7413A93F724A79CD73890244713171a42bF"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreich2hfv66zez2swbtk2ganh7ciettvs4jumcwd5nm2rcu5rla4ztu","projects":[{"name":"Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)","id":"0xedf9e50a29cce86c43d4cf0567b7976f279470beee0e6306ac0f03b6947536d8","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)","logoImg":"bafkreigbzrqpcqrg7dztert2drj3ndadlapwm3mjqumo23yll4opmbmnc4","website":"https://attest.org","bannerImg":"bafkreic6tetieosgiyr4ermedtjp5eqyygvvi62mrxf65amz5decsm5tlu","createdAt":1723234414153,"userGithub":"brycealan","credentials":{"github":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..hdsMXu-AwI2C0QL0ox5yFMqhQx4kQqC6O8FudtLriCnVTWkSH2wt-jCJt2oTS_l0_IgX6OG6KBL9nfiR640oCg","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-09T20:09:02.019Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-09T20:09:02.019Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-07T20:09:02.019Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x3e95B8E249c4536FE1db2E4ce5476010767C0A05","hash":"v0.0.0:+xnSoDzzX5xWR8p3E89ozrqYF3jlP79wxJayQWRMBIc=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextGithubOrg#ethereum-attestation-service#106047649"}},"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..Z1wA2Ha_Ux2ymBQP9Aq2WFpsOc_svLtDZ3qRDwSaQNhjJRMQdft7gv9Yw9x3w_56cONCOagg1aua94YAma4OAw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-09T20:08:50.791Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-09T20:08:50.790Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-07T20:08:50.790Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x3e95B8E249c4536FE1db2E4ce5476010767C0A05","hash":"v0.0.0:eNdhHBqDxhxkE8MtngPe9llNRVb6VQEeR00RKf6xy5E=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#eas_eth"}}},"description":"**EAS** is a public infrastructure for making onchain and offchain attestations about anything. \n\n**Public Good. Open-Source. Token Free. Permissionless.**\n\n## Attestations?\nAttestations are digital signatures on structured data, enabling entities like smart contracts, individuals, or businesses to verifiably state facts about anything, i.e. \"I attest this information is valid\". They are foundational for building trust in both online and onchain experiences. We've provided extensive documentation to help you quickly [**learn more about the core concepts**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/category/core-concepts) of EAS and attestations.\n\nWith over **2 million attestations** made, EAS is empowering developers to create reliable and transparent applications. Since you can attest to almost anything, the [**use cases and ideas to build**](https://docs.attest.org/docs/category/ideas-to-build) are virtually limitless.\n\n## Enabling Real World Impact\nReal-world applications on Ethereum often face challenges in bridging the gap between smart contracts and tangible impacts in physical communities. There's a primitive that's been missing. How do we actually decentralize more than just money and assets? \n\nThere have been use cases that have been talked about for a decade like Land Registries, Voting Systems, Supply Chain Provenance, and much more. But how do you actually know who or what data to trust? It needs to be verifiable and signed by an entity that matters. Imagine a world where:\n\n- **Land Registries** are secured by governments or local authorities attesting to land ownership, creating immutable records that reduce fraud and simplify property transfers.\n- **Voting Systems** ensure transparency and security by allowing citizens to attest to their votes.\n- **Supply Chains** are made trustworthy by manufacturers attesting to the origin and authenticity of goods, enhancing traceability.\n- **Healthcare Data** remains secure and private as medical professionals attest to patient information, ensuring only authorized access.\n- **Financial Inclusion** is expanded as organizations attest to micro-loans, savings, and other financial services, helping underbanked communities access essential resources.\n\n### Land registry example on Sepolia:\nThis is an example of a parcel of land being attested to by defining the property type and polygon area.\nhttps://sepolia.easscan.org/attestation/view/0x345567560b051a78d17cdc2669ddc5b859bc6c388b10110f05bb848e7d32655a\n\n\n## Celo Attestation Use Cases\nAttestations provide a straightforward yet powerful way to create digital signatures on data, enabling others to trust and build upon that information.

Rifai in Italian means “Do Over” and offers an alternative path for cultural and ecological regeneration.\n\nThe previous round of gitcoin donations helped us produce recurring mutual aid ReFi events where we\n\n-Planted 400 moringa trees, that will provide super nutritious food for humans, biomass for soil, and habitat for animals and insects.  \n\n-Kickstarted the foundation of a syntropic Agroforestry food forest named \"Butterfly Hill\". \n\n-Made over 500 seed balls with native species -Held activities at 8 different locations around the bioregion. -Used dMRV platform Silvi Protocol to log the planted trees using smart phones and drone imagery. \n\n-Created an agroforestry ecocredit with Sunflower Ecotech -Writing a library of Italian language regenerative finance and permaculture educational content.\n\n-Provide training and outreach for communty tree planting projects to onboard to the Silvi App\n\nIn the past 9 months, we have onboarded over 70 people with wallets and have issued over 160 NFT tickets on Mego.cx for participating in mutual aid events from tree plantings to beach cleanups. See the onchain community activity here https://dune.com/turinglabsorg/rifai-sicilia\n\nHosted and recorded community calls with various guests as we build up a video library. https://www.youtube.com/@refisicilia \n\nYour donations will help \n\n-Support the growth of the syntropic agroforestry school at Butterfly Hill to restore 3 hectares of bare land into a thriving food forest through continued education for local farmers. We need to raise 1200 euros to purchase a water tank (liquidity pool) so we can install an irrigation system for the farm.\n\n-Help us invest in a tool library and machinery that is needed for regenerative agriculture like chicken tractors, and wood chippers for the community to share.\n\n-Seed the bioregional association to support local permaculture and tree planting projects in more parts of the island. \n\n-Continued online and offline events and education for web3 onboarding in Italian and English. \n\n-Improve the rifaisicilia.com website to add more features to serve the community better.\n\n-Host another Rifai week in October 2024 to focus on regenerative olive production\n\nParticipant Testimonials\n\n“Rifai Sicilia balanced the real life intersection of agroecological practice and ReFi onboarding and dMRV use into an awesome, wholesome and spirited event.” Hereward McGillivray\n\n\"We came together and did the thing! This was one of the first events where it really felt like we made a tangible impact, actually regenerating land instead of coming together to talk about it! It was also a catalyst for refining our Agroforestry Stewardship Methodology. Definitely a highlight of the year 🌻💚🙌🌱\" - Sev Nightingale\n\n“Thank you so much for everything!

As part of the ReFi Italia family and ReFi DAO network we are working to develop best onchain regenerative practices in our local ecological context while learning and sharing with other nodes around the world.\n\n## Vision\n\nOur goal is to make Sicily a beacon for the Mediterranean and beyond, showcasing how regenerative bioregional cultures can flourish using blockchain technologies. Through our \"rebioregionaling\" process, we aim to reforest and rehydrate the landscape while restoring all eight forms of capital and integrating it into a healthy circular regenerative economy.\n\n## Key Initiatives\n\n- Syntropic Agroforestry\n- Permaculture Education and Training\n- Reforestation and Rainwater Retention\n- Wildfire Prevention and Trash Cleanup\n- River Health Monitoring \n- Seed Saving\n- Cultural Heritage Preservation\n- Agrotourism and Holistic Grazing\n- Local Farmers Markets\n- Mutual Credit Commitment Pooling\n- Web3 Education and Onboarding\n\n## Funding Priorities\n\n1. Educational Events: Continued online and in-person training in permaculture, syntropic agroforestry, rainwater harvesting, forest fire prevention, and holistic grazing.\n2. Tree and Seed Stock: Acquisition of certified cultivars of fruit and nut trees.\n3. Commons Tool Library: Investment in shared equipment (excavator, chipper-mulcher, tractor, greenhouses) to support farms transitioning to regenerative practices.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nWe employ various tools and methods to measure our impact:\n\n- Silvi App: Tracking tree planting and growth across member sites\n- Mego Tickets: Monitoring participation in mutual aid and education events\n- Grassroots Economics: Developing mutual credit currencies to support regenerative efforts\n- Bloom Network: Publishing impact reports linked to Karma Gap\n- Soil Science Workshops: Tracking soil quality health on partner farm sites\n- Atlantis App: Collaborating for river quality monitoring\n- Hypercerts: Minting verified ecological impact\n- Basin: Launch nature token on Zora.\n\n## Recent Achievements (Since Previous Funding Round)\n\n- Onboarded 4 more partner farms to Silvi App\n- Added 3 new mutual credit vouchers to our commitment pool\n- Deployed adopt.rifaisicilia.com to financially support tree plantings in the region\n- Planted 1,000 trees at our demonstration syntropic agroforestry site\n- Constructed our Charmverse knowledge repository dao.rifaisicilia.com\n- Hosting monthly online member meetings\n- Helped to found ReFi Mediterranean group\n\nOur full impact profile can be found here: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/rifai-sicilia\n\nOur initiatives demonstrate a clear commitment to ecological regeneration, community empowerment, and sustainable economic practices. \n\nWith continued support, we aim to expand our impact and solidify Sicily's position as a model for bioregional
