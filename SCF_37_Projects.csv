Smilepay Global,SCF #37,"Send stablecoins like a text, globally!",Smilepay Global,Applications,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$50000.00,$16666.67,42405.48,8/20/2025,Build,"Smilepay is an app and API that enables users to send (off-ramp) stablecoins (USDC, EURC, PYUSD) from the U.S. and Europe directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa.","Problem  
Sending money across borders in Sub-Saharan Africa costs an average of 7.9%, compared to the global average of 6.4%, making it the most expensive remittance corridor in the world. To avoid high fees, millions are turning to stablecoins like USDC. However, converting these digital assets into local currencies remains costly, opaque, and largely informal, creating risks and inefficiencies. In many African countries, including Ethiopia, there is no formal way to off-ramp stablecoins into bank accounts and mobile money networks. Users must rely on black-market channels that are expensive, slow, and prone to fraud - further discouraging adoption and trust.  

Solution  
Smilepay is an app and API that enables users to send (off-ramp) stablecoins (USDC, EURC, PYUSD) from the U.S. and Europe directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa. We integrate with regulated local banks and mobile money networks in Africa - and soon in Latin America and Asia, to provide seamless, low-cost, and fully compliant stablecoin off-ramps, making cross-border payments as easy and affordable as sending a WhatsApp message.  

Product 1 (App):  
Example, a user can send $100 worth of PYUSD (PayPal‚Äôs stablecoin) from Venmo to the Smilepay app. From there, the user has two options: they can either instantly transfer that PYUSD peer-to-peer to another Smilepay user in Ethiopia who will receive the stablecoin directly in their wallet or they can send it to any of the 29 banks we‚Äôve integrated in Ethiopia. In the latter case, the recipient will receive the equivalent amount in Ethiopian birr (ETB), directly deposited into their bank account.  

Our partner bank receives the PYUSD and can convert it into fiat currency at their discretion. This flow is straightforward to implement, as our partner banks are motivated to earn foreign exchange. Integrating PYUSD is seamless due to its upcoming support on the Stellar network (check link below üëáüèª), which Smilepay is also built on. This model is simple and straightforward to expand and will soon be extended to other African and Asian countries.  

https://stellar.org/press/paypal-pyusd  

Product 2 (API):  
Our API allows any regulated financial app, whether fintech, mobile banking, or crypto wallet - to offer cross border payments to Africa, Asia, and Latin America using stablecoins.  

Our API customers fall into two categories:

a. Web3 native platforms (e.g., Venmo, Cash App, crypto wallets): If a Web3-native platform like Venmo integrates our API, users won‚Äôt need to download the Smilepay app. They can directly send PYUSD to any of the 29 integrated banks in Ethiopia and eventually to banks across all supported countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. And with just one integration with Venmo, we can serve more than +90 million people.  

b. Web2 fiat based platforms (e.g., Bank of America, Zelle, ING): Our API isn‚Äôt limited to crypto-native apps. Traditional fiat-based banking apps can also integrate Smilepay API to offer international transfers through stablecoins without needing to become Web3-native themselves or disrupting the user experience. There are two key flows:  

‚Ä¢ Fiat-to-fiat: A user sends local fiat (e.g., USD or EUR) from their bank app to a recipient in Africa or Asia. Behind the scenes, Smilepay API converts it into stablecoins (e.g., USDC or PYUSD), routes it efficiently through blockchain rails, and then off-ramps it into fiat in the recipient‚Äôs country, dramatically lowering costs and settlement times.  

‚Ä¢ Fiat-to-stablecoin: Alternatively, the sender can choose to have the recipient receive the funds directly in stablecoins like USDC, EURC, or PYUSD, giving them access to dollarized savings and on-chain financial tools.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBk2POsUOW3zqBzoKWYg-9Fe7QGffxCe5lYcX6cKrOA/edit?usp=sharing,"##### 1.

We plan to collaborate closely with Stellar‚Äôs existing ambassador network in Ethiopia. These ambassadors are already engaged in blockchain education and advocacy, and can play a key role in driving adoption of our stablecoin off-ramp solution. By onboarding them as local champions of Smilepay, we‚Äôll tap into their trust networks to accelerate user sign-ups and provide direct product onboarding support, especially for freelancers, crypto users, and tech-savvy youth in Addis Ababa and other major cities.  

2. Community Engagement Through Local Blockchain Events  
We‚Äôll organize and co-sponsor meetups, workshops, and panel discussions with Ethiopia‚Äôs growing blockchain community. These events will demonstrate how Smilepay bridges global stablecoins and local fiat, giving attendees hands-on experience with the app. We‚Äôll also host hackathons to invite developers to build with Smilepay and Stellar, deepening local ecosystem engagement and attracting integration partners.  

3. Strategic Social Media Marketing & Influencer Outreach  
Our campaign will focus on visibility through respected tech personalities in Ethiopia and the diaspora. We‚Äôll engage Ethiopian tech influencers, fintech founders, and African crypto thought leaders to post about Smilepay‚Äîhighlighting our real-time bank transfers and stablecoin use cases. This will give Smilepay credibility and boost user interest organically.  

4. Cross-Marketing With Partner Bank  
We‚Äôll run joint campaigns with our partner bank, including shared social media announcements, radio ads, and educational posts about how Smilepay helps attract forex through stablecoins. Since the bank benefits directly from these flows, they are incentivized to promote us across their channels, branches, and user base. This partnership gives Smilepay immediate institutional legitimacy and reach within Ethiopia‚Äôs regulated financial system.","1.  We have integrated with 29 Ethiopian Banks
    
1.  We launched five weeks ago and are currently live on both Android and iOS in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, UAE, and Ethiopia. Users in these countries with a USD debit or credit card can send money directly to any of the 29 Ethiopian banks we‚Äôve integrated. So far, we‚Äôve processed over $9,600 in transaction volume while focusing on fixing bugs, improving the user experience, and optimizing onboarding. This initial traction has been achieved with zero paid marketing‚Äîdriven purely by word of mouth and a few organic social media posts.
    
1.  Every new user is automatically issued a Stellar blockchain wallet on the backend‚Äîlaying the foundation for our upcoming stablecoin off-ramping feature. Soon, users in the U.S. and Ethiopia will be able to off-ramp stablecoins like USDC and PYUSD directly into local bank accounts. Currently, as you can see on the explorer link below, the accounts created on-chain are issued our own branded stablecoin, but we are transitioning to USDC to ensure broader compatibility, trust, and liquidity.

1.  We‚Äôve already completed a successful 2-month stablecoin off-ramp pilot with one of our Ethiopian partner banks, which demonstrated strong institutional demand. Banks are excited to participate because stablecoin and remittance flows often bypass their systems. Smilepay gives them a direct channel to capture these foreign exchange inflows‚Äîcritical in high-forex-demand markets.
    
1.  Our main goal for SCF 37 is to expand this stablecoin off-ramping capability beyond the pilot to all 29 banks we‚Äôve integrated with in Ethiopia.

Tipper,SCF #37,Tipper mainnet (Post kickstarter),Tipper,Applications,,Awarded,33.0,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$70875.00,$47250.00,120737.77,9/10/2025,Build,Tipper is the platform for LaAm content creators who want to monetize their audience & receive USDC on Stellar,"Tipper is the best platform for Latin American influencers, artists, and communities who want to monetize their audience, receive support from fans around the world, and automatically convert tips and earnings into Digital Dollars by receiving USDC on Stellar. Creators love to finally be able to receive and withdraw their funds in Dollars anytime, from anywhere‚Äîespecially those who do not have a U.S. dollar bank account, and even those who do not even have a bank account.

Tipper enables content creators to receive small payments from their fans around the world and converts those payments into Digital Dollars (USDC on Stellar); this feature enables content creators to unleash revenue streams, creates new product opportunities, and allows them to be more independent and free.

**After completing and being awarded a validation prize during the kickstarter program, we're have been adding those insights and suggestions into our roadmap: we are ready to hit mainnet fast, and focus on growth and scale.

Tipper is composed of three different modules; we'll build the first two for our initial launch

-   Content creator‚Äôs hub: This is where creators can share their personal story, their passion and links to their social media and best work. This hub will allow creators to channel their following to read and learn from them,¬† and share love from their fans, as well as it being the epicenter for them to sell their artwork or subscriptions.
    
-   Monetizing network: Once the fan agrees to support their favorite creator‚Äôs , they are then moved to the monetizing hub, where fans select in which way they want to pay for the support they are giving. Initially card payments , as well as USDC on Stellar are enabled. In the future this will also have other less common payment methods, as well as other crypto.
    
-   Tipper APP: IN A FUTURE SUBMISSION we will build a non-custodial app that receives funds and withdraws to one whitelisted address to begin with, and will improve the app for our future versions, in order to improve the tipper experience. WE‚Äôll do this as a result of our interviews and first interactions with content creators, after delivering our proof-of-concept MVP in order to validate our initial kickstart findings.
    

Through seamless integration of all its components, Tipper offers a platform that empowers content creators to monetize their passion and audience in an easy and affordable way, while automatically receiving payments via the Stellar network‚Äîhelping to drive greater adoption of Stellar, increasing demand and awareness for Stellar as the driving force on the space and a real-world tool of crypto adoption.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB06IfbNqtfYWXmpnDVdZ_uEqgX0_OKv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110653500898179745003&rtpof=true&sd=true,"We will focus our user acquisition for our early adopters on those jurisdictions, as we focus on solving one main problem: Social media content creators in these regions cannot monetize their content in an automatic way.

-   Run our MVP with around 50 test users by launch; grow to 100 testers in first months; surpass 500 registrations before end of 2025, and achieve at least 5000 registered users in H1 2026.
    
-   Transact the first 1,000 USDC on Stellar in the first month, then get to 5,000 ARR in Q1 2026
    
-   Get to high 3 figures of TX count in 2025, then surpass mid 4 figs in 2026
    
-   Grow our social media presence to a community of over 5,000 in H1-2026",https://tipper.lat/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB06IfbNqtfYWXmpnDVdZ_uEqgX0_OKv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110653500898179745003&rtpof=true&sd=true,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F67H3Y3avss&feature=youtu.be,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","#### Our growth strategy for the MVP phase focuses on three key actions:

-   Drive usage among beta testers and design partners.  
    We aim to generate at least $1000/month in transactions from our initial dozen beta testers and design partners. We‚Äôll refine and improve the product based on their feedback and encourage them to recommend Tipper to their network. Our goal is to grow this a closed group of 50 early adopters in a private community.
    
-   Kickstart adoption in three underserved niches.  
    We‚Äôll target cosplayers, musicians, and donation-driven animal shelters ‚Äî groups that are now overlooked but rely heavily on small, loyal networks. Growth in these niches will be driven by word of mouth and an invitation-only sign-up process, helping us reach our first 500 users by the end of Q4.
    
-   Focus on three underserved regions.  
    We‚Äôll concentrate on Bolivia, Paraguay, and Venezuela ‚Äî markets not served today by incumbent companies. Initially, access will remain invitation-only, then expand via access codes. This approach will allow us to build a strong foundation, enabling our goal of reaching at least 5,000 subscriptions by 2026.
    

To execute this, we‚Äôll partner with mid-sized social media creators who already have engaged audiences in regions with complex financial systems ‚Äî starting with Venezuela and Paraguay, and exploring Bolivia, Caribbean islands, and similar markets.

We are working with the following users as initial design partners:

-   Fax1703 (IG 2540 Follows)¬†
    
-   albanycoiman (IG 6042 Follows)
    
-   carlospenalozao (IG 42.6k Follows)
    
-   CheoChop_Oficial (IG 92k Follows)¬†
    
-   ReveronRichie (IG 102k Follows)
    
-   @cxrrly (Twitter/X 173.2k Follows)
    
-   6 others (Combined following of around 100k, including Ezio Rojas, and more)
    

We will focus user acquisition for our early adopters on those jurisdictions, as can solve a big issue they have: Content creators in these regions cannot monetize their content.

#### Offer/Message:

-   For Creators: ""Now you can finally get direct support from your fans. With Tipper you can earn more, and build stronger relationships with your fanbase.""
    
-   For Fans: ""Support your favorite local creators instantly. Small tips, big impact.""
    

#### Distribution and specific plan:

ÔªøWork and fine-tune our product by working closely with our first 50 content creators:

-   Closed invitation only beta product for the first 50 creators leveraging our personal networks (Personal, plus X and Linkedin invitations from founding team); heavy social media marketing actions.
    
-   Establish direct relationship with influencers (partner with relevant creators to promote Tipper; offering zero fee for a year, which has no cost to us)
    
-   For sign ups after the 50 first creators, we will create FOMO with a waitlist
    
-   Organize influencer marketing meetup or/and webinar
    

The other component of our launch plan includes working on Fan Acquisition:

-   Social media marketing (target fans of specific creators)
    
-   Social media promotions: Meet & greet days
    
-   Creator promotion (creators encourage their fans to use Tipper)
    

#### With this plan we will grow, by organically onboarding our first 50 users, then growing to 100, then 1000, and then 5000 in the first 3 Qs.","In a nutshell, we have:

-   Grown 451% followers on main social media (Instagram) by sharing we will soon be available. IG grew from 100 followers to almost 600 in just one month. [[Visit Tipper's IG]](https://www.instagram.com/tippercreator/?hl=en)
    
-   We grew 5,320% visits to our website, after sharing we'll soon be available. Today, our only traffic source is IG. We'll triple once we add more channels.
    
-   Through website visits we have a whitelist of +200 possible beta testers, who organically registered to our website.
    
-   Group of 20 design partners who use social media for income, and want to increase their performance.
    
-   Combined reach of 550,000 followers from our first dozen beta testers/design partners.
    

Since we began validating the idea and interviewed content creators as design partners, we secured a loyal group of two dozen launch partners who have more than 500,000 followers in aggregate.

You can see a detailed report of our grown on this three slide doc:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fCGUg0Vq4ROs2KciVq0L4Ev_Nrh3XPZlwtMtN00epro/edit?usp=sharing

A key insight we want to share is that every one of the initial group of influencers has invited someone else on their network as a Tipper user for our closed beta; this happens because Tipper solves a real pain point they are frustrated with: LatAm influencers are currently limited on how to monetize their audience.

We initially set to speak to only ten influencers and through their own interest, we crossed over 24 interviews.

In our closed-door demo, during bitcoin pizza day in Venezuela, 100% of surveyed attendees liked the concept, 93% of them signed up to join¬† the waitlist, and almost ¬Ω of them requested more features, such as shared revenue from promoted sales, and adding specific tipping amounts for crowdfunding, which are As a result of this, we conclude our product concept has strong market demand.

Even though we have not gone live with our platform, the demand we are seeing on social media, leads us to expect hundreds of new accounts signups per month during all of launch in Q4 2025, as our posts get dozens of comments of people wanting to try it out.","Brief description: Build the base and working functionalities for the Content creator‚Äôs hub.

#### What makes DomiPago different

1.  Chat‚Äëfirst UX ‚Äì no separate app download is required; the entire flow lives in a WhatsApp conversation most users already trust and use daily.
    
1.  Stellar‚Äënative settlement ‚Äì every transfer rides USDC on Stellar, delivering sub‚Äësecond speeds and near‚Äëzero fees that traditional rails can‚Äôt match.
    
1.  Two‚Äëway dynamic ‚Äì receivers aren‚Äôt passive; they trigger requests, set purposes, and steer payout preferences, turning remittances into a dialogue.
    
1.  Multi‚Äësurface access ‚Äì identical functionality is mirrored in a responsive web/app for users who prefer a traditional interface.
    
1.  Consumer‚Äëgrade simplicity, crypto‚Äëgrade transparency ‚Äì senders and receivers experience a 60‚Äësecond flow, while every hop is verifiable on‚Äëchain.
    

DomiPago hides the complexity behind crypto, wraps it in everyday chat, and delivers value where it‚Äôs felt immediately: family support that arrives faster, cheaper, and with zero guesswork.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nNtzQGWsxsQoD7sEkv_ftOBXfF1uD8X_/edit,"Success for DomiPago is measurable in three data‚Äëdriven dimensions‚Äîadoption, usage, and ecosystem impact‚Äîwithin 12‚ÄØmonths of mainnet launch:

1.  Adoption¬†  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ15‚ÄØ000 total users onboarded, of which 40‚ÄØ% are monthly actives (‚â•‚ÄØ6‚ÄØ000 MAU).  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØAt least 5 banking partners in the DR embed the ‚ÄúRequest via DomiPago‚Äù flow, giving us sustained receiver acquisition at <$5 paid CAC.
    
1.  Usage¬†  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØCumulative remittance volume ‚â•‚ÄØUSD‚ÄØ1.5‚ÄØmillion, processed across ‚â•‚ÄØ6‚ÄØ000 transfers.  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØAverage active user sends ‚â•‚ÄØ3 transfers per month; month‚Äëover‚Äëmonth retention ‚â•‚ÄØ50‚ÄØ%.  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØAverage door‚Äëto‚Äëdoor settlement time ‚â§‚ÄØ40‚ÄØseconds; average fee savings vs. legacy rails ‚â•‚ÄØ50‚ÄØ%.
    
1.  Ecosystem impact on Stellar¬†  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ75‚ÄØ% of total volume settles as USDC on Stellar rails, evidenced by on‚Äëchain transaction hashes.  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØ1‚ÄØ000+ Soroban escrow contracts executed in production, securing ‚â•‚ÄØUSD‚ÄØ250‚ÄØK.  
    ‚Ä¢‚ÄØPublish open‚Äësource docs and SDK snippets; target ‚â•‚ÄØ3 external developers or wallets integrating our escrow status endpoint.
    

Hitting these metrics means tens of thousands of dollars saved in fees for Dominican families, thousands of new users interacting with Stellar for the first time, and a live Soroban use case that demonstrates real‚Äëworld programmable money at scale.",https://domipago.com/,https://github.com/melomar10/stellar_integration,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cge3vBITA6M,Yes,"1. Anchor the receiver side through Dominican banks (Month‚ÄØ0).  
We are finalizing integrations with two Tier‚Äë1 banks that collectively hold >60‚ÄØ% of retail deposit accounts. Each bank will add a ‚ÄúSolicitar dinero con DomiPago‚Äù button inside its mobile app and WhatsApp broadcast lists. When a customer taps it, our bot pre‚Äëfills a payment request linked to the user‚Äôs IBAN‚Äîno app download, no new KYC. The bank wins higher deposit inflow and an innovation headline; we instantly gain thousands of verified receivers with near‚Äëzero CAC.

2. Pull in senders with co‚Äëbranded corridors (Months‚ÄØ0-3).  
Once requests are flowing, we flip on diaspora‚Äëside acquisition through:

-   Visa ‚ÄúBack‚Äëto‚ÄëSchool‚Äù and ‚ÄúNavidad‚Äù co‚Äëpromos (landing pages + interchange rebates) targeting U.S./CA cardholders who already send money home.
    
-   Diaspora NGOs & hometown associations that can share referral codes in group chats; each first remittance earns the receiver a fee waiver and the NGO a small donation paid out of spread.
    
-   Influencer live demos on TikTok/Instagram showing ‚ÄúWatch me send $50 in 40‚ÄØseconds.‚Äù
    

3. Reinforce virality with product‚Äëled loops (Months‚ÄØ3‚Äë6).  
Every successful payout pushes a ‚ÄúShare your link‚Äù nudge to both sides.‚ÄØBecause the entire flow lives in WhatsApp, a single tap forwards that request into family group chats, multiplying exposure at marginal cost ‚âà‚ÄØ$0.

4. Expand corridors once liquidity flywheel spins (Months‚ÄØ3‚Äë12).  
With DR receivers activated and U.S. volume ramping, we replicate the same playbook for EU SEPA and Canada Interac senders, using local bank newsletters and ethnic‚Äëmedia radio to seed the first wave.","Since launch, DomiPago has proven that WhatsApp-based remittances are not just possible‚Äîthey‚Äôre preferred. By removing the need for apps or crypto knowledge, we‚Äôve built a product that fits seamlessly into users‚Äô daily lives while delivering real-time financial value. Our traction reflects not just early adoption, but strong signals of product-market fit, retention, and readiness to scale with Stellar rails.

-   $676‚ÄØK in remittance volume moved to date‚Äîall generated organically, with zero paid advertising.
    
-   +3‚ÄØ000 users onboarded, with‚ÄØ 25‚ÄØ% monthly actives‚Äîdriven primarily by WhatsApp referrals and diaspora community word‚Äëof‚Äëmouth.
    
-   High engagement: each active sender completes 3.7 transfers on average, at an $233 average ticket, covering both micro‚Äë and mid‚Äësized remittances.
    
-   Retention that signals stickiness: 50‚ÄØ% month‚Äëover‚Äëmonth retention‚Äîhalf of first‚Äëtime senders return the very next month, outperforming most retail‚Äëremittance benchmarks.
    
-   Operational proof‚Äëpoints: end‚Äëto‚Äëend settlement ‚â§‚ÄØ40‚ÄØs; customer‚Äësupport median response <‚ÄØ5‚ÄØmin through the same chat thread.
    
-   Market validation: recently launched joint campaigns with Visa and multiple Dominican banks, promoting DomiPago inside their user bases to request funds via our WhatsApp flow‚Äîsetting the stage for a substantial growth surge over the coming quarters.","Deliverable‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì EU SEPA on‚Äëramp via Bridge

LumenShade: privacy pools,SCF #37,LumenShade: Privacy for Stellar,LumenShade: privacy pools,Applications,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$135000.00,$45000.00,112894.7,8/5/2025,Build,"LumenShade gives Stellar users a powerful new option for financial privacy, paving the way for fully compliant private DeFi on Stellar.","At LumenShade, we're bringing financial discretion to Stellar.

We were inspired by projects like Tornado Cash, 0xbow‚Äôs Privacy Pools and Railgun.

Our mission is simple: empower users with financial privacy, while building the foundation for fully compliant, private DeFi on Stellar.

Motivation

Stellar is an incredible platform for fast, low-cost global payments, especially across emerging markets.

But today‚Äôs users don‚Äôt have strong privacy options.

We believe that privacy is a necessity, not a luxury, and it‚Äôs time for Stellar to start offering real options.

Right now, payments on Stellar are fully public.

We strongly believe that mainstream blockchain adoption will come when privacy is integrated by default.

Think about NGOs working in sensitive regions, businesses wanting to protect their payment flows, or just regular individuals who simply don‚Äôt want their entire transaction history displayed to the world‚Ä¶

LumenShade can help make this possible.

Our modular components will be reusable for other projects in the ecosystem, fueling further innovation in privacy across the Stellar developer community.

Description

In simple terms, LumenShade lets users deposit Stellar assets (like XLM and USDC) into a shared pool, and withdraw them later without anyone being able to trace the link between the deposit and the withdrawal.

Here's how it works:

-   When a user deposits funds into the pool, he receives a unique note (a secret) that proves ownership of that deposit
    
-   Later, when the user wants to withdraw, he generates a zero-knowledge proof showing they own one of the previous deposits, by proving knowledge of the previous ‚Äúnote‚Äù
    
-   The smart contract verifies the proof and, if correct, releases the funds to a specified address. There‚Äôs now no way to link that withdrawal with any deposit
    
-   The more deposits, the bigger the anonymity set, the more private each user is
    

Here are some of the key features we're excited to deliver:

-   Privacy-preserving deposits and withdrawals, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs
    
-   Intuitive frontend and CLI tools, for a seamless user experience
    
-   An innovative compliance layer featuring:
    
    -   selective disclosure: users can prove the origin of funds when needed
        
    -   admin control on deposits: blacklisting if required
        
-   Modular, reusable smart contracts and circuits, enabling future ZK projects on Stellar
    

We also take inspiration from Railgun, which has set a high bar for compliant privacy pools with features like ‚Äúprivate proof of innocence‚Äù.

1.  An Android mobile app, named Ben Wallet.
    
1.  A WebApp, to provide account information and details view on account transactions and account stats, named MyBen hosted on https://myben.xyz.
    
1.  An RPC server that handles blockchain interaction as well as Launchtube interactions, named BEN RPC.
    
1.  A monitoring and reporting server to provide timeseries information on the platform's status, as well as consolidated stats, named Ben OpenStats.
    
1.  An offload-compute server, for part of the farming cycle, so devices can offload compute-intensive tasks, named Remote Grow.
    
1.  A Kotlin SDK for Android mobile apps, to support building Stellar-based apps on mobile devices.
    

It is important to highlight that once Protocol 23 is deployed, higher limits will require higher network usage to re-test; the mobile app has the potential to bring additional ‚Äútest‚Äù users (where load comes from real-life interactions).

Complete information on the platform can be found on our live docs: https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/ben-wallet",https://ben-wallet.gitbook.io/ben-wallet/sdlc/development/architecture/context,"'-   At least 15% conversion rate from Web-based farmer to Ben Wallet, after mainnet launch

A logistics pilot with a Houston-based medical-supply NGO is tracking roughly $1.2 million of equipment bound for Ukraine and Kenya. Every pallet scan fires a smartphone-triggered smart contract that stamps GPS and device metadata onto Stellar, giving the shipper an immutable chain-of-custody without any new hardware or connectivity burdens. This corridor is our first real-world stress-test of the logistics module and sets the groundwork for an Afghan lane now being scoped.

Using the exact same code-base, we spun up a remote-vetting application for at-risk Afghans pursuing Special Immigrant Visas. Participants submit time-stamped, geotagged ‚Äúpattern-of-life‚Äù check-ins through the mobile interface, creating an auditable proof-of-presence ledger that immigration advocates can reference during the application process. The pivot demonstrates how the platform shifts effortlessly from freight assurance to human-movement verification without touching the underlying architecture.

Next in the queue is a Humanitarian Mine Action module being in partnership with Georgetown University‚Äôs McDonough School of Business. The project will apply reBlue‚Äôs verification stack across all five HMA pillars (clearance, risk education, victim assistance, advocacy and stockpile destruction) through a mixed-methods research program scheduled to launch in 2025. While pre-deployment, the partnership signals a clear path into a third vertical and shows how the same trust layer can be ported into any high-friction domain where provenance decides impact.  

Our most notable source of recent traction might need to be approached in a separate SCF Submission, as it deviates from what we pitched in June. However, it is extremely noteworthy, as we believe it to have the highest overall upside, not to mention that engaging with informal value transfer systems was our original focus prior to the collapse of USAID.

¬†H.R.260, or the ""No Taxpayer's Dollars for Terrorists Act"" is a bill which passed the US House of Representatives and June 24, 2025, and seeks to explore the movement of US funds to Afghanistan. Notably, the bill explicitly calls for an examination of cash assistance programs, and transactions made using Hawala ‚Äì an informal value transfer system that is ubiquitous across the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa.

The objective of this pilot is to show that despite its checkered history, Hawala is a critical lifeline to Afghan Allies, and can be modified to be transparent and auditable while also bypassing Taliban control measures. Veteran-led NGOs ‚Äì (of whom reBlue‚Äôs CEO is a founder) have long used Hawala or other informal systems to deliver aid‚Äîwill serve as the backbone and coordinating body for a live demo of a U.S.-based, blockchain-enabled Hawala tracking system.  
  
This pilot will be paired with an Oxford-backed research project (our founders are MSc and PhD students respectively) and the findings of both will be presented directly to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with whom we have an existing relationship.","'-   Open-source scan-to-ledger pipeline that anchors delivery event metadata (GPS, timestamp, IMEI) to the Stellar testnet using Soroban

NOTE: The introduction of H.R.260 --which is mentioned frequently through this application-- is arguably the single greatest opportunity that reBlue has encountered. In no small part, this is because engaging with informal value transfer systems is both reBlue's original purpose prior to USAID's collapse, and is CEO Thomas Kasza's area of research at Oxford.

Dobprotocol,SCF #37,Dobprotocol: Validating RWA Funding,Dobprotocol,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$143330.00,$47776.67,119860.73,8/5/2025,Build,Dobprotocol unlocks secure decentralized funding by proving real revenue from physical infrastructure.,"Dobprotocol unlocks secure decentralized funding by proving real revenue from physical infrastructure.

We enable structured DeFi investment into real-world assets such as EV chargers, solar panels, and data centers by validating their future cash flows before any token is issued.

Our system addresses two major bottlenecks in real-world asset (RWA) finance:

First, on the investor side, there is a lack of verifiable data. Infrastructure investments often rely on subjective claims, limiting trust and adoption. Dobvalidator solves this by bringing auditable, revenue-based data onchain. This transparent scoring system replaces subjective trust with objective, data-driven assessments.

Second, on the operator side, infrastructure teams face limited access to decentralized funding. Even strong projects struggle with the complexity of tokenization and the absence of a reliable process. Dob Token Studio addresses this by transforming validated future cash flows into programmable tokens with automated onchain payouts. This makes infrastructure assets ready for integration into DeFi from the beginning.

Dobprotocol is building foundational financial infrastructure for real-world yield: secure, composable, and integration ready.

  

Our system consists of two core components:

Dobvalidator

Dobvalidator brings real world infrastructure data onchain through a transparent and accountable scoring process. Assessments are based on verifiable criteria, such as revenue, uptime, location, and technical specs, and are recorded onchain for public inspection. Projects are evaluated against a consistent set of risk and revenue factors. Our aim is to make this process fully transparent and auditable onchain. This approach replaces blind trust with transparent, methodical validation, ensuring only infrastructure with verifiable cash flows and operational quality can issue tokens and enter DeFi.

Dob Token Studio

Dob Token Studio is a token creation suite that issues programmable tokens backed by validated infrastructure revenue. These tokens represent future revenue streams and include built-in logic for automated, decentralized revenue sharing. Investors receive payouts directly, with no intermediaries. Tokens are composable and ready to plug into lending markets, AMMs, and dApps.

By combining Dobvalidator and Dob Token Studio, Dobprotocol transforms real-world infrastructure into yield-bearing digital assets that can be integrated across the decentralized economy.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kn3WPiuZDqN91N1lDFSCZPm3dyTMWY5I6YrS4eCG0xo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.byaoi144ub2a,"Short term (by January 2026):

-   Validate and score a minimum of 5 infrastructure operators through Dobvalidator, covering assets such as EV chargers, solar panels and data centers.
    
-   Launch two revenue-backed token issuances via Dob Token Studio, representing over $150,000 in projected cash flows over a 12‚Äì18 month period.‚Äù
    
-   Deploy the full protocol stack on Stellar Mainnet, including validation scoring, token issuance, and automated payout logic, meeting SCF Build‚Äôs third tranche requirements.  
      
    

Medium term (by June 2026):

-   Expand to 10 active, revenue-generating infrastructure assets tokenized onchain.
    
-   Surpass $1 million in cumulative future revenue tokenized through Dobprotocol.
    
-   Complete at least 2 integrations with DeFi protocols or primitives to enable use cases such as secondary markets, collateralization, or staking.
    
-   Facilitate participation from ecosystem partners and early institutional users leveraging our infrastructure-backed tokens.  
      
    

Primary KPIs:

1.  Total projected revenue tokenized through Dobprotocol (value of future cash flows validated and issued onchain).
    
1.  Total revenue distributed to tokenholders (measured by actual onchain payouts).
    
1.  Performance ratio: percentage of projected revenue that has been successfully paid out onchain.",https://www.dobprotocol.com/,https://github.com/dobprotocol/dobvalidator,https://youtu.be/ffMfuD6Q4lo,Yes,"Dobprotocol is ready to scale. After validating our technical architecture and product-market fit during Stellar Kickstart, we now focus on expanding real-world integrations and onboard infrastructure assets and investors. Our Infra Readiness Sprint sits at the heart of this strategy.

#### Infra Readiness Sprint: Free pre-validation for real-world infrastructure

As part of our Go-to-Market strategy, we offer a fully subsidized Infra Readiness Sprint, funded by Dobprotocol. This consists of a 1‚Äì2 hour pre-validation session where our team meets directly with infrastructure operators to assess their project‚Äôs financial, technical, and operational readiness for tokenization.

During this session, we provide strategic guidance, review available data, and help determine whether the project is ready to move forward with onchain validation and token issuance. If not, we prepare a readiness report outlining the gaps and next steps to qualify for tokenization in the future.

This program is Dobprotocol‚Äôs way of lowering the barrier to entry and ensuring that only serious, well-prepared infrastructure projects advance into our validation pipeline.

#### Validation tiers and pricing model

Post-sprint, operators move into one of three paid validation tiers based on project scale:

Tier: Small

Fee (USD): $4,500

Expected Infrastructure Type: Pilots, installations under $250K

Tier: Medium

Fee (USD): $9,000

Expected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure between $250K‚Äì$1M

Tier: High

Fee (USD): $18,000+

Expected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure over $1M or high complexity

These tiers allow us to serve a broad spectrum of projects, from early-stage EV networks to large-scale mining or solar deployments.

Operator traction and early deployments

We‚Äôre actively validating and preparing real infrastructure projects for onchain tokenization:

-   eHive (EV chargers): First validator integration completed and ready for tokenization in the Build phase. This marks our first full deployment across the validation and token issuance stack.
    
-   Bas3 (data centers): Validation logic is underway. We‚Äôre collaborating closely to complete the data ingestion and scoring process before designing the tokenization structure.
    
-   Solar and mining pipeline: We‚Äôve initiated conversations with key stakeholders in Chile‚Äôs energy and mining sectors, including outreach through the Universidad de Chile Mining Engineering alumni network. These sectors attract significant investment at the corporate level, but mid-sized operators and high-potential projects often struggle to access efficient or transparent funding.
    

To extend our reach, we‚Äôve launched a strategic referral program targeting advisors, brokers, and consultants who are already connected to infrastructure operators, especially in mining and renewable energy. These experts often have first hand access to capital hungry projects and can help identify operators that would benefit from tokenizing their future revenue. By offering aligned incentives and a clear onboarding path, we turn industry knowledge into a scalable source of qualified leads and long term ecosystem partners.

#### Revenue model

Our business model is aligned with long-term platform growth and real asset performance. We monetize through:

-   Investment fee: 1.5%, applied when investor funds are transferred and locked into the infrastructure-backed token issuance.
    
-   Management fees: 0.5%, charged on revenue streams distributed through our smart contracts.
    

This dual-fee structure allows us to support infrastructure operators while creating a sustainable model for protocol operations and development.","Since being selected for the Stellar Kickstart cohort on May 3rd, Dobprotocol has demonstrated rapid execution, delivering product, onboarding partners, and validating demand.

Moonlight Protocol,SCF #37,Mainnet Launch of Private Payments,Moonlight Protocol,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$134990.00,$44996.67,110031.26,7/31/2025,Build,Brings private payments to Stellar Mainnet using a UTXO model and provider-mediated channels for compliance and control.,"Before continuing, we strongly recommend watching this demonstration video.

Moonlight provides the full infrastructure and tooling required to enable compliant, privacy-preserving payments on Stellar. We deliver the complete protocol implementation, from smart contracts to SDKs and service frameworks, so ecosystem participants can build, operate, and integrate privacy-enabled services with reduced complexity. Our offering includes:

-   Privacy Channels: On-chain Soroban solutions that maintain private UTXO ledgers, support multi-party bundled transfers, and enforce channel-specific asset and provider policies.
    
-   Trusted Privacy Provider (TPP) Framework: A modular off-chain relayer service that handles authenticated bundle submission. Moonlight provides a compliant-ready base implementation that can be customized and extended to meet specific regulatory needs, such as KYC or sanctions screening.
    
-   Moonlight SDK: A TypeScript library that abstracts UTXO key derivation, balance fragmentation, provider integration, and transaction lifecycle management, simplifying development.
    
-   Reference Wallet: A minimal, open-source client that connects to privacy channels via selected TPPs, enabling users to send private, self-custodied transactions with a unified UX.
    
-   Protocol Governance Layer: Smart contract layer for channel configuration, provider quorum management, and compliance policy enforcement at the protocol level.
    

These components are delivered as open-source tools to reduce the entry curve for wallets, institutions, and service providers. Moonlight makes it easier to integrate privacy on Stellar while maintaining custody, composability, and regulatory flexibility.",https://moonlight-10.gitbook.io/moonlight-docs/readme/whitepaper,"Moonlight‚Äôs success will be judged on real usage, growing liquidity, and broadened asset coverage on Stellar Mainnet. We track four signals: provider count, daily transactions, private TVL, and supported assets.

By Month 3 after launch, the system should look alive, not lab-grade: at least 3 production Trusted Privacy Providers, 1 live wallet integration, 25‚Äì50 private transfers per day, and roughly $100 000 locked in a single XLM privacy channel.

By Month 6 after launch, we need clear traction: 6 active TPPs, 2 additional wallets or fintech partners, 150‚Äì200 daily transfers, over $250 000 held privately, and three assets (likely XLM, USDC, EURCV) flowing through multiple channels. These numbers show that users and liquidity stick around once the novelty wears off.

By Month 12 after launch, network effects should be visible: 10 or more TPPs including at least one regulated institution, 500-plus daily transfers, $1 million in private balances, and 5 assets serviced. Hitting these marks proves Moonlight can scale privacy without draining liquidity from Stellar‚Äôs public pools and sets the stage for private Soroban-based DeFi.",https://moonlight-10.gitbook.io/moonlight-docs,https://github.com/Moonlight-Protocol,https://youtu.be/7q2lzW2EXek?si=gObzEiR03Woqu0kc,Yes,"Moonlight‚Äôs launch strategy is built around one guiding principle: make privacy on Stellar feel like an overnight upgrade, not a multi-month integration project.

1- Positioning & Core Promise

Moonlight turns any wallet, exchange, or fintech running on Stellar into a privacy-enabled service‚Äîwithout forcing them to cede custody or rewrite their compliance stack. Everything is open source on day one, so the community can inspect, fork, and improve the code as it grows.

2- Early-Mover Focus

We will start with three launch partners already in our pipeline: xBull Wallet (retail users), Palta Labs (infrastructure), and one EU-based institution partner from Aha Labs (e.g. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, etc). Their combined user base gives us immediate real-world volume and a feedback loop to harden the product before broad release.

3- Three Phases, Twelve Months

-   Developer Preview (Month 1-3) ‚Äì We maintain one testnet privacy channel (XLM) and publish a TypeScript SDK, reference wallet, and tutorial quests on Stellar Quest.
    
-   Mainnet Pilot (Month 3-4) ‚Äì After the SDF audit, we deploy audited contracts, activate the first mainnet channel, and register a quorum of three Trusted Privacy Providers (TPPs). Aha Labs also runs its own TPP for redundancy during the launch phase.
    
-   Ecosystem Expansion (Month 4-12) ‚Äì We add USDC, EURCV, and two regulated assets, invite additional TPPs, and launch a permissionless-provider beta.
    

4- Adoption Channels

We rely on three low-cost levers: (a) co-marketing with partners through blog posts, X Spaces, and Stellar Meridian workshops; (b) hackathon sponsorships (e.g. Dora hackathon style) that award bounties for the best Moonlight integrations; and (c) in-wallet prompts that encourage users to upgrade to private transfers in a single click.

With a tight, phased rollout and concrete early adopters, Moonlight positions itself to become Stellar‚Äôs default privacy layer.","Moonlight is already live on the Stellar testnet with a working proof of concept, including deployed Soroban contracts for UTXO-based transaction abstraction and off-chain components that support SEP-10-based authentication and bundle submission. This testnet implementation validates the core architecture and demonstrates the feasibility of compliant, private payments on Stellar. You can watch this demo video for more information.

Moonlight is developed by Aha Labs, a leading Stellar integration partner with a proven delivery record. The team helped Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale-FORGE launch the EURCV stablecoin on Stellar, designed key portions of the Soroban/Stellar CLI, and maintains Loam, a Soroban developer toolchain with over 40K downloads across its CLI and SDK (according to Crates.io). Loam is in production or active pilots at firms like EquitX, Ziriz, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and others.

Moonlight has strong early interest from the ecosystem. xBull Wallet‚Äôs maintainer plans to integrate Moonlight privacy channels in its next release. Key SDF collaborators, including Tyler van der Hoeven and Tomer Weller, have reviewed and endorsed the architecture. Palta Labs has committed to integrating Moonlight once mainnet support is live.

As part of Station F since September 2024, Aha Labs has expanded its European institutional outreach and is already working with multiple financial institutions on tokenization and payments. Moonlight serves as a natural privacy and compliance extension to these ongoing engagements.

Moonlight is also part of the 2025 cohort of the DraperU X Stellar residency program.","#### Deliverable 1: Core Privacy Channel Contracts

Built on modern web technologies, this visualizer transforms complex transaction data into intuitive, interactive experiences.  At its core, the platform features a dynamic visual graph that displays each transaction's flow - complete with color-coded connections, animated sequencing, and detailed operation nodes showing type-specific data. Whether you‚Äôre tracking payments, contract interactions, or account creations, every element is rendered for quick understanding.","We are building a Stellar Transaction Visualizer and Debugger, a developer-focused tool that makes it easier to understand, simulate, and debug both Stellar Classic and Soroban smart contract transactions. Using Stellar SDK and the Soroban client, the platform offers interactive visualizations, smart contract call analysis, testnet simulations, and error diagnostics. By clearly displaying the flow and structure of transactions, the tool supports both new and advanced developers building on Stellar. Future plans include providing a lightweight SDK for seamless integration into existing wallets and explorers, increasing its accessibility and ecosystem impact. This directly supports Stellar‚Äôs goal of growing a strong, tool-rich smart contract development environment.

Our tool is not intended to compete with full-featured explorers like Stellar Expert, but rather to complement them by focusing specifically on transaction visualization, debugging, and Soroban smart contract introspection‚Äîfeatures not currently offered in traditional explorers.

While Stellar Expert excels at displaying transaction data and account history, it does not provide a flow-based view or interactive debugging for Soroban contracts. Our tool bridges that gap by offering a developer-friendly visual layer that shows the sequence and relationships between operations, contract calls, and errors.

To avoid duplicating existing explorers, we plan to release an SDK that enables platforms like Stellar Expert, Freighter, or custom dApps to embed our visual flow component or debugging features within their own UI. This modular approach reduces friction and increases adoption, allowing users to access deeper transaction insights without leaving their preferred explorer.

Ultimately, the goal is to integrate rather than compete, making our tool a back-end service and front-end component that can serve the broader Stellar ecosystem and enhance the debugging experience across tools.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5zpEHvipaswRPdukDhHyE9nNvz27XW8qtD_2FrtZkI/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0,"-   Developers can visualize Stellar and Soroban transactions in a clear flow format.

The initial focus is to launch the tool for testnet transactions and gather developer feedback via Stellar community forums and Soroban channels. We will then release an SDK to enable integration into third-party explorers and wallets, increasing exposure. As the product matures, we aim to collaborate with existing tools like Stellar Expert for adoption","While still in the early stages, I've made significant progress:

Stellar AI Agent Kit,SCF #37,AI Agent Toolkit: Soroban to MCP ,Stellar AI Agent Kit,Developer Tooling,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$108000.00,$36000.00,90315.76,8/5/2025,Build," Enable secure, AI-powered interaction with Soroban contracts by generating MCP servers and streamlining smart wallet adoption through accessible Policy Signer tools","Executive Summary:  
As AI agents become more prevalent in fintech and automation, developers need secure ways to let those agents interact with blockchain contracts. The Stellar AI Agent Kit offers the first complete toolchain for safely connecting AI agents to Soroban contracts using MCP servers and delegated signer infrastructure.

The Stellar AI Agent Kit is a secure developer toolkit designed to make Soroban contracts safely accessible to AI agents. It enables developers to expose contracts via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, while also providing signer infrastructure and testing tools to ensure predictable, permissioned execution.

Important note: This toolkit does not use LLMs to write or generate contracts. Developers still write their own contracts. The tools in this kit help generate supporting infrastructure‚Äîsimilar to how TypeScript bindings are generated from existing specs‚Äînot the core logic.

1. MCP Server Generator (CLI Plugin)

Parses Soroban contract interfaces to generate MCP-compliant server bindings in both TypeScript and Python, following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard.

Impact: This is not an AI tool writing contracts. It‚Äôs a developer utility‚Äîlike TypeScript binding generators‚Äîthat translates a contract‚Äôs existing spec into a format that AI agents can safely understand and call. With Python support, this makes Stellar contracts accessible from AI development platforms like LangChain, OpenAI, and Claude, without any backend boilerplate.

2. Policy Signer Generator (Interactive CLI)

A structured, interactive CLI that generates scoped signer rules from contract interfaces, allowing developers to define secure, rule-based policies for delegated execution.

Impact: This tool does not use AI or natural language processing. It‚Äôs a straightforward developer utility‚Äîlike a configuration assistant‚Äîthat helps builders define signer logic using structured inputs. By leveraging the Soroban contract spec, it guides developers through permission setup (e.g. function-level access, destination restrictions, quotas) and outputs deployable signer configurations. This eliminates the need to write custom signer logic in Rust, while giving developers full control over what agents are authorized to do. It's an essential bridge to adopt Stellar‚Äôs powerful Policy Signers without deep protocol expertise.

3. Policy Sandbox Web App

A visual, browser-based simulator for testing how Policy Signers behave during various contract calls and transactions.

Impact: Before connecting agents to real wallets, developers need to validate their signer logic. The Sandbox allows them to create test wallets, assign policies, simulate contract calls, and observe whether the signer allows or rejects the request‚Äîmaking it easier to debug and onboard safely.

4. MCP Client SDK (npm)

An SDK to simulate transactions, manage delegated signing, and submit them to Stellar, fully integrated with MCP server outputs and smart wallet models.

Impact: This SDK enables real applications‚Äîbots, voice agents, UIs‚Äîto safely interact with Soroban contracts through previously defined signer rules. With no need for full private key access, apps can execute contract logic within secure, delegated boundaries, guided by the developer‚Äôs own permissions setup.

-  

Together, these tools form secure infrastructure‚Äînot speculative AI automation. They support developers by reducing boilerplate, enabling safe agent interactions, and enforcing strict contract-level controls across the entire lifecycle.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yk4VSQFQrf35UfSnRO-OpOQ0rxs-dIjlh_GeZK4x_NA/edit?usp=sharing,"Success for this project means delivering a complete, secure, and composable toolchain that allows developers to build AI agents capable of interacting with Soroban smart contracts ‚Äî regardless of their interface, language, or use case.

We will consider this submission successful when the following criteria are met:

Contract ‚Üí MCP Server (Language-Agnostic)

-   Developers can convert any Soroban contract into a fully compliant MCP server, using the CLI tool.
    
-   Both TypeScript and Python bindings are supported, enabling integration with a broad range of agent platforms (e.g. OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, ReAct, custom agents).
    
-   **Contracts produce AssembledTransaction XDRs and include auto-generated parameter validation and prompt-ready tool descriptions.  
    **
    

Policy-Based Agent Access

-   Developers can create secure policy signer configurations through the Policy Signer Generator CLI, using only contract specs ‚Äî no deep Rust/Soroban internals required.
    
-   **Signer logic can be safely tested in the Policy Sandbox Web App, simulating agent-triggered calls before deployment.  
    **
    

Agent SDK Integration

-   The MCP Client SDK allows any AI agent (chat, voice, or backend automation) to:
    
    a.  Discover tool functions from an MCP server,
        
    a.  Simulate transactions,
        
    a.  Sign with the correct delegated key (e.g. a policy signer),
        
    a.  Submit securely to Stellar via MCP-compatible flows.  
        

This means developers can build:

-   Voice-controlled wallets (‚ÄúSend 10 USDC to my cousin‚Äù)
    
-   Chat agents that manage account permissions
    
-   **Automated agents that rebalance portfolios, initiate payouts, or optimize yield  
    ‚Äî all without needing full access to a private key.  
    **
    

Ecosystem Signals of Success

-   At least 3 live agent demos (chat or voice-based) using the toolchain by external builders or during hackathons.
    
-   MCP CLI plugin is accepted into the Stellar CLI ecosystem or maintained as a widely adopted dev tool.
    
-   Public tooling and server endpoints maintain >99.9% uptime post-mainnet launch, tracked via our status page.",https://stellarsandbox.dev/,https://github.com/JoseCToscano/stellar-ai-demo,https://www.loom.com/share/1d0868ed999d4d1f958390ab2c63cc11?sid=d004d1a2-d010-4d46-bf8b-b8e743ce0cbc,Yes,"This is not a product commercialization campaign. It is a developer-focused release strategy aimed at delivering secure, composable infrastructure that enables AI agents to safely interact with the Stellar network. Our focus is on making Soroban contracts AI-accessible while preserving full developer control through signer policies, simulation tooling, and real-world agent integrations.

Ongoing Collaboration with Stellar‚Äôs Product Team

Throughout development, we will work closely with the Stellar Product team to ensure alignment with the ecosystem‚Äôs long-term vision. This includes continued collaboration with VP of Product Nick Gilbert and John Canneto, who have already expressed support and emphasized how this work lowers the barrier to entry for new developers while prioritizing security through policy enforcement. Their feedback will guide integration priorities, plugin architecture, and documentation standards.

Indentura,SCF #37,Stablecoin Credit Lines for SME lending.,Indentura,Financial Protocols,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$120000.00,$40000.00,88803.87,8/13/2025,Build,Rebuilding credit markets on top of stablecoin rails.,"Indentura lets borrowers pledge high-quality offchain collateral and draw on stablecoin credit lines from a global onchain liquidity pool. Our offchain infrastructure gives lenders enforceable legal claims and real-time visibility into collateral while preserving borrower privacy.

Our first product enables speciality lenders to access revolving credit lines to manage cash flow more effectively and also offer similar revolving products to SMEs.

To do so, we‚Äôre developing three key pieces of infrastructure:

1.  Soroban Credit Vaults: Vaults that support ERC-4626 behavior on deposit and ERC-7540 on withdrawal, adapted to Soroban‚Äôs native architecture. At a high level, a lender deposits Stellar USDC into a vault, and receives in return a yield-bearing receipt/share token representing its position. The vault allocates all deposited capital into whitelisted protocols to generate yield. When a borrow wants to draw down a credit line, a designated MPC wallet calls a function to unwind yield positions and release stablecoins or offramped USD to the borrower. Interest is accrued and tracked on a block-by-block basis. This represents a new asset primitive for the Stellar ecosystem and an adaptable vault standard that leverages best practices from EVM protocols to interface between onchain and offchain capital flows, driving real-world utility to Soroban.
    
1.  Custody and Compliance: Vault depositors require a legal security interest over the collateral backing their credit exposure. Borrowers, in turn, require institutional-grade interfaces, including bank accounts for fund disbursement and MPC wallets to manage on-chain obligations. This demands a legal and operational layer built around bankruptcy-remote SPVs that support custody, loan servicing, and payment flow management on behalf of vault participants. We‚Äôre building the robust, institutional-grade bridge required for assets to flow safely between traditional legal structures and the Stellar network.
    
1.  Reporting and Automation: Moving funds from a Stellar USDC vault deposit to a borrower‚Äôs bank account involves treasury operations across various systems, including yield management, compliance checks, and disbursements. On repayment, syncing borrower data back to on-chain vault interfaces requires connecting private data warehouses with privacy-preserving pipelines. This infrastructure ensures capital flows and reporting are seamless, secure, and trustworthy for all participants.
    

This grant will allow us to develop and launch these infrastructure components on Soroban, beginning with a live credit facility for a U.S.-based specialty lender. It‚Äôs the first step toward building stablecoin-native credit rails that are programmable, transparent, and globally accessible.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIp7U9HXTbqb99xsBUmvB8C96LQXtI57A7fijTXf5v4/edit?usp=sharing,"We‚Äôll consider this build successful if we meet the following criteria:

-   One real-world borrower is live on mainnet, accessing a stablecoin-denominated credit line via Soroban vault infrastructure.
    
-   One lender vault is deployed and capitalized, with $500k of Stellar USDC earning yield via a mix of DeFi strategies and borrower repayment.
    
-   At least one half of a repayment cycle is completed, demonstrating stablecoin flow from vault to borrower and back through fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure.
    
-   All supporting infrastructure is live: custody (MPC), legal structure (SPV), and lender-facing reporting.
    
-   End-to-end flows are auditable via on-chain data and off-chain reporting, ensuring transparency for vault participants and protocol stakeholders.
    

Impact:

This launch will demonstrate that stablecoins can serve as more than just payment rails. They can function as the foundation for programmable, enforceable credit infrastructure. That opens the door to:

-   Improved capital access for businesses excluded from traditional credit.
    
-   New sources of yield for lenders seeking real-world exposure beyond volatile DeFi tokens.
    
-   A new class of financial products on Stellar that serve real economic activity.
    

This deployment will serve as a reference implementation for future vaults and borrowers, laying the foundation for permissionless credit infrastructure across the Stellar ecosystem.",https://www.thawdigital.com/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWE7L7jNR0,Yes,"We‚Äôre sequencing our go-to-market by pairing crypto-native capital with real-world borrowers, starting with a market wedge where stablecoin mechanics unlock new products that banks and credit funds can‚Äôt offer.

Our distribution strategy scales both capital and credit demand, with each phase unlocking new types of depositors and borrowers. A more detailed view into our 4-phase expansion plan can be found in the Indentura Thesis Document here: https://www.notion.so/indentura/Indentura-Thesis-Document-225c4663170780adb8e5de0045ac1224.

Initial Borrower Strategy

Our first borrower will be a U.S.-based specialty finance company that originates term loans or revenue based financing to small businesses and has expressed explicit demand for a revolving credit structure. We are collaborating directly with this partner to structure the initial facility, validate the legal + off-chain infrastructure, and confirm repayment data flows.

This initial borrower relationship gives us:

-   A controlled underwriting + servicing relationship.
    
-   Clear operational requirements for drawdowns and repayments.
    
-   A proving ground for cross-chain and off-chain capital orchestration.
    

Initial Lender Strategy

Our first vault will be capitalized through closely held sources: the team, advisors, and aligned partners with experience in DeFi and credit underwriting. These stakeholders understand the risk profile and serve as both early liquidity providers and feedback channels.

We especially want to focus on lenders who already have positions in DeFi protocols, as Indentura provides an additional way to stack yield on top of their existing positions.

This demonstrates:

-   Programmatic yield movement between DeFi and borrower capital.
    
-   Stablecoin liquidity that can be committed, drawn down, and repaid.
    
-   Transparent, auditable performance and credit behavior.
    

Future Growth

Once the first facility is live and stable, we will expand across both borrower and lender channels:

-   Borrower side: additional specialty finance firms, fintechs offering embedded credit products, and eventually businesses operating entirely on stablecoins.
    
-   Lender side: crypto-native family offices, DAO treasuries, and eventually fintechs or neobanks embedding Indentura-powered yield products.
    

Over time, we aim to support the creation of permissionless credit vaults, enabling anyone to launch programmable credit pools backed by real-world collateral, with Stellar serving as the primary infrastructure layer for compliance, liquidity, and settlement.","Our approach to validation is grounded in our team‚Äôs experience in the credit industry. Our founder, Tom Meister, has structured debt transactions at both funds and fintechs, led legal and operations at unicorn fintech companies, and advised and backed leading DeFi lending protocols. His background gives us confidence that this pain point, the absence of flexible, programmable credit infrastructure, is both acute and systemically underserved.

That perspective led us to validate the problem directly with our target users: nonbank specialty lenders. We‚Äôve already received clear confirmation through direct conversations and formal letters of support, one of which is enclosed below.

The lender, a U.S.-based specialty finance firm originating term loans to SMBs, provided a signed letter describing the structural challenge: they cannot access or offer revolving credit due to limitations in how their capital sources operate, and the inefficiencies of traditional financial rails.

In the letter, their CEO writes:

‚ÄúIf lenders like [us] could draw on a revolving credit facility in stablecoins, we would incur significantly lower interest costs and could pass the savings along to our borrowers... We would be interested in piloting a borrower-facing revolving credit facility backed by stablecoins.‚Äù

He also confirms this is an industry-wide issue:

‚ÄúVirtually none of ‚Ä¶ businesses [like ours] are able to access revolving bank lines of credit, and so we are forced to obtain term loan credit facilities that present the financial drawbacks I have described above. This puts businesses like [ours], and the small and medium sized businesses we serve, in a much worse position than we would be in if revolving credit were available.‚Äù

The full letter is enclosed and signed. We‚Äôre currently in active discussions with other specialty lenders facing the same problem and can secure additional letters over the coming weeks, if needed. We have also received interest from a venture philanthropy looking to deploy this type of solution within their market. A copy of their signed letter of support is also attached.

This validation affirms strong borrower demand and growing pull from institutional participants who, while traditionally unfamiliar with crypto, are eager to adopt Stellar-based solutions that solve real-world capital inefficiencies.
