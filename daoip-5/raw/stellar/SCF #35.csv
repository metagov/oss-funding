This cross-chain breadth demonstrates our capacity to develop scalable, innovative, and impactful products that capitalize on each ecosystem’s strengths, with particular expertise in interoperability and multi-token management.

A recent survey in October 2024 involving 87 developers, blockchain professionals, and businesses from the USA, France, Luxembourg, and Turkey revealed that 75% faced challenges integrating non-Stellar tokens and 80% sought a more straightforward method for multi-token management and cross-chain transactions. These insights confirm the growing need for the MUWP-Stellar Multi-Token Cross-Chain SDK.

Our existing MUWP DApp already runs on the Stellar mainnet, having garnered more than 2,100 page views in the past year and recording 37 swaps in November alone, underscoring early traction and user interest. Beyond Stellar, MUWP integrates 59 DEXs and 44 bridges, making cross-chain swaps more affordable and efficient for diverse blockchain users. This network of connections positions MUWP as a one-stop platform for streamlined transfers and enhanced liquidity.

Industry recognition further validates our approach. We were selected by 50 Partners, a French VC-led incubator offering high-level mentorship, and we also joined the Chainlink Build Program, which improves our infrastructure for decentralized oracles and cross-chain security. Within the Stellar ecosystem specifically, we have already incorporated Stellar’s DEX for optimizing liquidity flow, begun leveraging Soroban smart contracts for cross-chain transactions, and simplified token issuance and conversion for new Stellar projects.

Our successful deployments on Solana and Aptos highlight our technical depth and ability to adapt to unique blockchain architectures. On Solana, we integrated high-performance liquidity pools to accelerate transaction speeds for cross-chain swaps, and on Aptos we created custom tools and modular SDK components to streamline multi-token swaps in a parallel execution environment. These achievements underscore our commitment to crafting efficient, developer-friendly infrastructure that can likewise benefit the Stellar ecosystem.

By securing the SCF Build Award, we can enhance our SDK, reduce integration hurdles for developers, accelerate multi-token adoption on Stellar, and significantly expand cross-chain liquidity entering the network.

Reyts will use Stellar’s Path Payment Strict Send to automatically complete currency swaps when no peer match is found within a set time window (e.g., 30 minutes). This ensures users can still exchange at their chosen rate using Stellar's built-in liquidity.

Stellar in action:  
A user places a CAD→NGN swap. If no match is found, Reyts routes the transaction through Stellar’s decentralized exchange using Path Payment, fulfilling the swap at the requested rate with available liquidity.

A Soroban smart contract will monitor pending swap listings, and if a listing goes unmatched for a set period (e.g., 30 minutes), it triggers the fallback logic. The contract checks price conditions, validates rate limits, and initiates the Path Payment if criteria are met — all without human intervention.

Impact:  
This reduces wait times from hours to minutes, giving users a more reliable, seamless swap experience without changing how they use the app.

-  

💧 Decentralized Liquidity Pools

Reyts will leverage Soroban smart contracts to introduce automated liquidity pools, allowing vetted liquidity providers to contribute CAD and NGNC for swaps. These pools will follow AMM logic, automatically determining prices and executing trades.

Stellar in action:  
When a user initiates a swap, the system checks for peer matches. If none exist, it draws from Soroban-powered liquidity pools. Liquidity providers earn fees from every transaction they help fulfill.

Impact:  
More liquidity means fewer failed swaps, faster transactions, and greater user confidence — especially for less common exchange pairs like CAD↔NGN.

-  

✅ Compliance Automation

Reyts already enforces strict KYC/AML checks off-chain. As users begin to interact more directly with wallets, Stellar’s built-in compliance tools and Soroban will help enforce rules on-chain.

Stellar in action:  
Soroban smart contracts can restrict access to Reyts-issued assets unless a wallet meets verified compliance conditions (e.g., KYC flags or allowlists).

Impact:  
This ensures that even as Reyts moves toward decentralization, it remains fully compliant — with less manual overhead and more automation, supporting growth into new regulated markets.",https://shimmer-process-0ba.notion.site/Reyts-Stellar-Block-Chain-Upgrades-Technical-Architecture-1c79b7253112800ea2cfc5401d5ec683,"1.

Back Up Link To Reyts Traction Evidence","#### ✅ Tranche 1 – MVP: Stellar Integration & Swap Engine Prototype

Brief Description:

Build a backend prototype that connects Reyts to the Stellar testnet, sets up issuer and distribution accounts, and enables simulated swaps between QCAD, USDC, and cNGN using Path Payment Strict Send.

This milestone includes the first version of the Stellar-aware swap engine — a backend service that integrates Reyts’ existing P2P logic with Stellar’s infrastructure.

It will determine when to execute swaps directly between users and when to route via Stellar’s on-chain liquidity (e.g., after a timeout or lack of takers), ensuring reliable and transparent settlement across QCAD ↔ cNGN.

Note: The earlier ReytsCAD test asset has been deprecated in favor of working directly with QCAD issued by Stablecorp.

----------------

Traditional centralized exchanges often come with lack of user control over assets, high fees, and limited access to multi-chain trading. Centralized exchanges can be vulnerable to security breaches, while fiat-to-crypto conversions remain difficult due to local country regulations and operability.

However, DEXs also have challenges, such as complex bridging processes, lack of in-app fiat on/off-ramps, and incapability for high-frequency trading.Many DEXs rely solely on AMM swaps, limiting trading strategies and often leading to high slippage and poor price execution.

#### Stellar’s Untapped Potential:

-   SDEX’s orderbook model enables high-frequency, low-fee trading, but lacks:
    
    -   Multi-chain asset access (e.g., ETH, SOL → XLM).
        
    -   Seamless fiat integration (despite Stellar’s anchor network).
        

SwiftEx Solution:
---------------------

#### A. Stellar-Centric Liquidity Aggregation for Spot Traders

-   Aggregates Stellar AMM / SDEX orderbooks with major chains and AMMs (e.g., Uniswap, PancakeSwap)
    
-   Enables 1-click, cross-chain trades with best-price execution (more details mentioned in Mainnet deliverables)
    

#### B. Fiat On/Off-Ramp via Stellar Anchors & API Partners

-   Supports API-based and SEP-6 / SEP-24 integration for seamless fiat deposits and withdrawals (USD, EUR, etc.)
    
-   Already partnered with:

Description: SwiftEx will enable users to seamlessly bridge, swap, and trade assets in a single streamlined process. Users can input all necessary details upfront (Amount, tolerance and Asset details), and the system will handle multi-step operations like bridging and trading (via SDEX) through a backend proxy server. Once one step completes, signed transactions will automatically execute the next step on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

Additionally, users will have the ability to bridge Stellar assets back to their multi-chain wallets effortlessly. This process may involve automated multi-step swaps (e.g., converting Stellar assets into USDT via SDEX before bridging to another blockchain) to simplify complex workflows.

Example Use Case: A user imports ETH or BNB from their multi-chain wallet, swaps it for BTC on SDEX, and receives BTC in their wallet—all in one operation. Demo : - https://vimeo.com/1075076753?share=copy

","To keep up-to-date on Stellar ecosystem news and developments, you'd have to follow websites and social accounts for numerous outlets such as Coindesk, The Block, Blockworks, Cointelegraph, Ledger Insights, CNBC, and Forbes, just to name a few. You'd also need to follow official blogs and social channels from existing ecosystem participants such as Cheesecake Labs and Soroban Domains, and everything in between. And video? Hopefully, you're an avid user of various video platforms because you'll also need to subscribe to updates from platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Adding to this complexity, navigating SDF-specific sources adds another layer of difficulty, requiring a meticulous approach to stay informed about Stellar's protocol updates and announcements through the official Stellar website, SDF blog entries, Developer Discord, and official social media channels like StellarOrg and BuildOnStellar. Additionally, tracking progress and updates for the incredibly diverse ecosystem projects presents a unique challenge. From official blogs to GitHub repositories and Twitter announcements, it is incredibly hard to see who is actively building on Stellar and where to find more information about them. Being unable to efficiently find and view this information leads to the perception of lack of innovation on the network. This fragmentation not only makes it challenging to stay informed but also creates barriers to entry for those new to Stellar. Vital events and discussions are often missed due to the lack of centralized notifications and the diverse rules of engagement across platforms.

  

Experience the convenience of navigating the Stellar network's dynamic landscape through one centralized web hub - Lumen Loop. Lumen Loop is designed to streamline the Stellar blockchain network's vast information ecosystem into an organized, accessible format. Lumen Loop automatically scrapes the web for the latest Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and developments. The scraper then uses AI to categorize and tag the content, as well as provide shortened, or ""TLDR"", excerpts for searchability and ease of access. For example, want to see just educational content? We’ve got you covered! Looking for protocol updates? No problem! We’ve got a category for that! Spanish content? Check! Lumen Loop also includes a project tracker where each Stellar project has a detail page with summaries, development activity, social metrics and news, making it easy for the community to follow developments. Let’s say you are a SCF reviewer or voter and you want to know if a project has been active in the ecosystem. Head to the project page, and we’ll have a breakdown on their social and dev activity! Lumen Loop’s project tracker increases project transparency and accountability. Beyond news discovery, Lumen Loop offers a centralized events calendar that details Stellar-related live events, meetups, and conferences from a variety of sources with essential information for easy community participation. Subscribe to our calendar and you won’t miss out! This ecosystem-wide calendar will keep people informed and boost engagement within the ecosystem. Finally, once Lumen Loop finds new information about projects or a new event it automatically posts summaries to various communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit and X/Twitter. This helps promote projects and grow the ecosystem - by keeping everyone in the loop.

  

We create scrape rules to monitor Stellar project activity on different platforms. We normalize the discovered data from an enormous list of sources into one database. We use AI to give tags and categorize. This includes a manual review process. We push discovered content to our web platform where it's easily browsed by category, tag, project, etc. and also update the events page and the individual project tracker pages if applicable. We automatically push summaries of the discovered content to different social platforms.

  

The basic idea of Lumen Loop is as follows: Centralized Information Hub: Aggregates Stellar ecosystem news, updates, and project developments into one platform. AI-Categorized Streams: Uses AI to organize content into searchable streams, such as educational content or developer updates, or even SCF project news. Comprehensive Event Calendar: Offers a centralized calendar detailing Stellar-related events for easy community participation. Detailed Project Tracker: Features individual pages for Stellar projects with summaries, development activity, social metrics, and a project news feed. Automated Social Media Sharing: Promotes ecosystem projects and updates by automatically posting discovered content to platforms like Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Enhances Ecosystem Transparency: Increases project transparency and accountability through detailed activity breakdowns. Community Growth and Engagement: Aims to support community growth and project visibility within the Stellar ecosystem.

KindFi,SCF #35,Social Impact Crowdfunding,KindFi,Applications,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$79998.00,$26666.00,88676.06,5/22/2025,Build,Crowdfunding platform connecting donors with verified LATAM causes via milestone-based fund releases to prevent misuse of funds,"1.  Milestone-Based Fund Release Model: KindFi uses a milestone-based fund release model inspired by SCF, where each project receives funds in 2–3 tranches. Funds are held in smart contract escrows and only released when specific, verifiable milestones such as impact evidence, photos, or reports are met. Approval requires consensus from 3 of 4 platform admins. If milestones are not met, the smart contract automatically blocks further releases. In case of non-reimbursable donations, unused funds are redirected to a community fund; otherwise, they are returned to the donor.
    
1.  KYC & Passkey-Based Authentication: KindFi integrates an advanced user authentication system built on the Stellar Passkey Kit, enhanced for seamless onboarding and security. Users can register and sign in using biometric passkey eliminating passwords while ensuring strong, Web3-native identity verification. In parallel, our AI-assisted KYC flow ensures fast, compliant, and secure verification. Identity checks are optimized to prevent duplication and fraud, with on-chain attestations recorded through Soroban smart contracts for transparency and traceability.
    
1.  Community Fund & Governance: Once a year, locked funds from failed projects are redistributed through a community voting process powered by Soroban. Only users holding a Kinders NFT—earned through meaningful contributions—can vote to decide which eligible projects will receive the funds. This mechanism reinforces transparent, community-driven governance and gives real utility to the reputation-based NFTs
    
1.  Kinders NFT as Governance Key: The Kinders NFT, built on Soroban, serves as a dynamic governance and participation tool. It evolves visually and functionally based on each user's on-chain reputation and activity. As users contribute to causes, their Kinders NFT gains reputation points, unlocking greater decision-making power in community votes. This incentivizes continued engagement while reinforcing trust and transparency in the ecosystem.
    
1.  Reputation & Tiered Voting System: KindFi introduces evolving Kinders NFTs with progressive tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond—based on each user’s on-chain reputation. Higher tiers grant more voting power (1 to 10 votes per round), early access to campaigns, and exclusive rewards. Reputation grows through impact-driven actions like donation streaks, referrals, category diversity, completing quests, and successfully supporting projects. All actions and NFT progression are tracked and powered by Soroban smart contracts.
    
1.  On-Chain Referral Program: KindFi’s referral program lets users invite others to join and support causes using a unique referral code. When a referred user completes KYC and donates, both parties earn on-chain rewards powered by Soroban smart contracts. Rewards include reputation points and visual upgrades to their Kinders NFT. Soroban automates referral tracking, reputation updates, and tiered rewards, unlocking higher benefits as users grow their referral impact.
    
1.  Streak System: KindFi’s streak system rewards consistent donor activity through Soroban smart contracts. Streaks are built by donating frequently, in volume, or across diverse causes. Active streaks enhance a user’s Kinders NFT with dynamic visual effects and unlock benefits like increased voting power, reputation growth, early campaign access, and exclusive badges. Soroban tracks activity and enforces a grace period; if the streak is broken, progress resets automatically.
    
1.  Visibility & Recognition System: KindFi highlights top donors, projects, and organizations to foster community prestige and sustained engagement. Using Soroban smart contracts, the platform tracks real-time metrics like donation volume, campaign diversity, milestone success, and NFT level. Rankings dynamically update on-chain, powering the ""Feature Kinder"" section with titles like ""Top Donor"" or ""Best Regional Contributor."" Highlighted users and projects earn exclusive NFTs, increased voting power, early access, and visual platform badges. High-impact projects are automatically promoted, AI-recommended to new donors, and prioritized for matching fund campaigns, all managed transparently via Soroban contracts.
    
1.  On-Chain Community Rankings & Rewards: KindFi’s community ranking system incentivizes sustained participation through automated, transparent rewards. Soroban smart contracts manage real-time leaderboards and prize distribution based on user reputation and platform activity.
    
1.  Dynamic Contribution Challenges System: KindFi’s Quest System introduces gamified challenges that motivate users to donate consistently and across diverse campaigns. Quests encourage actions like supporting new categories, maintaining streaks, or completing non-refundable donations. This system promotes ongoing engagement, fuels user reputation growth, and sustains the flow of funds to the Impact and Community Funds, creating a more interconnected and resilient ecosystem.
    
1.  Matching Funds (Impact Fund & Community Fund): KindFi amplifies individual donations through a matching model powered by two key sources: the Impact Fund (fed by success fees and direct donations) and the Community Fund (filled with unused funds from failed campaigns, redistributed via annual community vote). Soroban smart contracts and AI assess project history and projected impact to assign dynamic matching levels: Basic: +20% Intermediate: +50% Premium: +100%
    
    This model incentivizes early contributions, enhances campaign momentum, and recycles unused funds to boost ecosystem resilience. Matching funds are fueled by retained campaign balances, fractional success fees (0.3–1%), quest completions, direct donations, and external sponsors seeking platform visibility.  
    

This is our next-generation crowdfunding platform leveraging Soroban smart contracts, Stellar infrastructure, and AI to create a secure, transparent ecosystem building a global movement of trust, transparency, and lasting impact",https://www.notion.so/KindFi-Architecture-Version-1-1-1d18754a4a4b8011b374dd993e370064,"Success for KindFi means reshaping how social impact is funded by proving that our stellar based milestone, transparent crowdfunding can outperform traditional models and unlock real trust at scale. Post-mainnet, our core success targets include:

-   50+ verified social impact projects launched across LATAM
    
-   3,000+ unique contributors onboarded through passkey + KYC flow
    
-   $250K+ in tracked donations processed via Stellar Network
    
-   At least 1 community-led governance cycles completed using NFT-based voting  
    

But metrics alone aren’t enough. True success means:  

-   NGOs and grassroots causes choosing KindFi over legacy platforms because they trust our blockchain milestone and escrow base model
    
-   Contributors returning not just to donate, but to participate in governance, complete quests, and grow their Kinders reputation NFTs
    
-   Developers and creators using KindFi not just as a product, but as a platform they can contribute to, and evolve  
    

We will know we’ve succeeded when a campaign’s credibility is defined not by who runs it, but by how it runs openly, transparently, and on-chain.  

Ultimately, KindFi aims to prove that blockchain isn’t just viable for real-world impact, it’s superior. Success is not just launch. It’s adoption, accountability, and communities becoming their own stewards of change",https://www.kindfi.org/,https://github.com/kindfi-org/kindfi,https://youtu.be/Hlh4R8u-lWU,Yes,"Our go-to-market strategy is grounded in real-world need, regional expertise, and a community-first approach, designed to scale KindFi from a LATAM-based pilot into a global, trust-driven crowdfunding platform. We are launching initially in Costa Rica, where our team is based and where we have already engaged local foundations and NGOs for early campaign onboarding. From there, we will expand across key LATAM regions where Stellar already has ambassador programs (e.g., Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Chile), aiming to co-create with those communities, identify trusted local projects, and onboard regional ambassadors into KindFi’s ecosystem. Our goal is to establish KindFi nodes in multiple countries, creating a real grassroots movement around verifiable social impact on Stellar.  

As LATAM founders, we understand firsthand the systemic challenges in our region access to funds, transparency gaps, and donor mistrust. That’s why we prioritize partnering with other LATAM-based projects, builders, and communities, because no one understands the region’s needs better than those who live them. KindFi is not designed in abstraction; it’s built in context.

  
We will strengthen go-to-market through partnerships with other Stellar-based solutions like Meru, Palta Labs Team, and other ecosystem tools that support onboarding, identity, and create impact. Together, we create a more unified experience for users entering Web3 for the first time without needing to understand its complexity at once.

  
On the marketing and PR front, we will:  

-   Launch public demo sessions featuring verified campaigns and live on-chain milestone releases
    
-   Publish impact stories of early KindFi projects through newsletters, social channels, and ecosystem blogs
    
-   Engage Web3 and social impact podcasts, LATAM blockchain communities, and Stellar’s own media channels
    
-   Engage alternative media and podcasters as ""No pasa nada"" and ""Delfino"" (Costa Rican Alternative News Source) to introduce the new way of changing things in LATAM using Stellar and KindFi together.
    
-   Build a contributor reward system that can be uses through the Only Dust program, incentivizing open-source participation, user-generated content, and social sharing enhanced with KindFi’s NFT badges and on-chain contributor recognition.
    
-   Participate in key regional events and hackathons to activate both developers and cause creators  
    

Digital marketing will focus on multilingual content (ES, EN, PT) across platforms like Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Instagram—anchored by a strong visual identity and messaging centered on “trustless transparency” and “real-world change powered by crypto and Stellar, the only blockchain truly impacting real-world causes.""  

Ultimately, KindFi’s adoption strategy is not just about reach it’s about depth. We are building a long-term presence in each region we serve, with local validators, community members, and project owners acting as stewards of impact. Our platform grows through trust, transparency, and local relevance not just paid promotion and dreams.","-   Pitched to Key Stakeholders: Successfully presented KindFi to representatives from USAID and other government programs, generating strong interest in its ability to ensure transparency and accountability in funding, as well as its potential to bring on-chain accountability to processes that are often handled off-chain.
    
-   NGO and Foundation Outreach: Initiated discussions with foundations and NGOs in Costa Rica to understand their funding challenges and demonstrate how KindFi’s blockchain-powered solution can effectively address these pain points
    
-   Developer Community Engagement: KindFi is connected to a global network of over 6,000 Web3 developers, actively raising awareness and visibility for the platform. Our current developer-focused channel includes more than 141 members from Argentina, Costa Rica, India, Nigeria, Colombia, and Chile.
    
-   LATAM Community Engagement: KindFi is deeply integrated with the Dojo Coding community, which brings together over 186 Web3 developers from across Latin America who are actively contributing to the platform’s growth and innovation.
    
-   Partnership: We have successfully established partnerships with several organizations working with highly vulnerable communities in the region, particularly in Costa Rica. One example is ACJ-YMCA, an organization present in over 170 countries and reaching more than 68 million people worldwide. Their mission to bring social justice and peace to youth and their communities will be supported through donation campaigns on KindFi once we go live on mainnet
    
-   Partnership: We have also formalized a partnership with the project and foundation Asociación Deportiva E.G Goicoechea to relaunch their efforts through fundraising campaigns on KindFi. This initiative began on March 5, 2011, in Costa Rica in collaboration with the international ISSOP foundation, under the name Escuela de Fútbol Holanda Purral. The project was designed to use sports as a way to reach vulnerable children and youth, offering them holistic development, improved living conditions, education in various non-sport areas, essential tools, and even access to meals. It successfully operated for 12 years and was sponsored by the Instituto Costarricense del Deporte y la Recreación, having supported over 1,500 children in extreme need. Unfortunately, the lack of funding led to its closure on March 3, 2023. Today, many of the children who were once uplifted through sports are left without hope or support.
    
-   Partnership: We have also secured agreements with animal rescue organizations in the region, including Auxilio Animal Cartago, SOS Rescates Felinos, Fundación Tierra de Animales, and Casas Cuna Puntarenas. These organizations operate in areas with significant needs, and their initiatives will be featured under the Animal Rescue category on KindFi once we launch on mainnet.

Brief description:  
The MVP represents the foundation of KindFi’s platform establishing a secure, decentralized, and transparent crowdfunding flow that validates both user and project authenticity from the first interaction. This phase includes the deployment of our end-to-end authentication and identity verification system, campaign creation interface, escrow-based fund custody, and contribution flows tied to milestone releases.  

Our architecture leverages the Stellar blockchain to handle secure fund management, real-time indexing, and on-chain verification of campaign data. Contributors can register, verify their identity through an AI-assisted KYC process that complies with SEP-0012, and securely log in using device-native Passkey authentication (biometric WebAuthn). This guarantees phishing-resistant access and links every user to a verified Stellar address through Soroban smart contracts.  

Project creators (Kindlers) will be able to create a campaign with clearly defined milestones. These milestones are recorded on-chain, and donations are held in escrow until completion is verified. An internal reviewer dashboard will allow milestone approvals to trigger on-chain releases of funds. While AI will eventually support verification flows, human administrators will validate them manually at this stage, with auditability ensured via SubQuery-based ledger indexing.  

The MVP also includes:

-   Initial onboarding integration using test mode to simulate real-world access
    
-   A multilingual frontend experience built with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui
    
-   Contributor and project creator dashboards for basic account and project management
    
-   Early implementation of NFT-based contributor identity and badge placeholders (non-dynamic at this stage)  
    

All smart contracts deployed in this phase (authentication and escrow) will operate on Stellar testnet, and all user flows will be fully testable with dev data and mock user verification.  

How to measure completion:  

-   Fully working flow from Passkey-based registration to first testnet donation
    
-   Admin dashboard triggers milestone-based fund release logic on testnet
    
-   SEP-0012-compatible KYC verification pipeline functional and connected to blockchain addresses
    
-   Campaigns are stored with milestone definitions and locked under escrow
    
-   Users can simulate donations using testnet wallets
    
-   Project creation, updates, basic search, and language toggle implemented in frontend  
    

This MVP unlocks not only our internal dogfooding and testing, but also external testing by contributors and community reviewers, who will be invited to audit and validate the core infrastructure","Estimated completion: November 2025  
Budget: $0 (Access to Stellar LaunchKit for audits and infra support)  

Brief description:  
The Testnet milestone focuses on expanding core functionality into a fully feature-complete product, operating on Stellar testnet and integrating Soroban-based smart contracts, gamification layers, and advanced contribution logic. This phase introduces the first version of our dynamic NFT-based reputation system, milestone automation, and AI-assisted moderation and onboarding tools. All flows will be testable end-to-end and structured for external audit and simulation.  

Key developments during this phase include:  
  
Dynamic NFT Reputation System (Kinders)

The Kinders NFT system, deployed on Soroban, evolves based on user impact. During Testnet, contributors will begin earning NFTs that grow in visual complexity and functionality based on their behavior (e.g., donation frequency, diversity of causes, completed quests, and referral performance). NFTs will be tied on-chain to each user’s account and updated via Soroban logic and contribution triggers. We will implement four progressive NFT tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond), each conferring a different number of governance votes and early-access privileges. This system establishes the basis for future DAO-style community engagement and voting on fund redistribution  
  
AI-Powered Project Review & KYC Enhancement

We will introduce our first live implementation of KindFi's AI layer, focused on assisting in:

-   Project legitimacy checks using Multimodal RAG for evaluating images, documents, and impact descriptions
    
-   AI moderation agents that detect fraudulent campaign signals or inconsistencies
    
-   Enhanced KYC confidence scoring and auto-flagging of suspicious submissions
    
-   An AI assistant that helps project creators write better campaign narratives, verify milestone documentation, and simulate expected impact
    

While human validation remains critical, AI tooling will accelerate throughput, help prioritize reviews, and maintain consistent standards  
  
Quest, Streak, and Referral Systems

We will deploy the first logic for KindFi’s gamified contributor experience, including:

-   Quest Engine: Smart contract and UI for goal-based participation (e.g., support a campaign in 3 different regions; donate 3 weeks in a row)
    
-   Streak Tracker: Reputation boost for consistent behavior over time (e.g., weekly/monthly donation consistency)
    
-   Referral Engine: On-chain Soroban logic to track referred users, update Kinders NFTs, and issue rewards automatically for verified onboarding and donation activity
    

This phase builds the incentive structures that transform passive donations into long-term, identity-linked participation  
  
Community Fund Governance (Simulation)

The Testnet phase will also include a simulated governance flow to redistribute unused or retained funds from unfulfilled campaigns. KindFi will introduce:

-   A voting UI accessible to Kinders with valid NFTs
    
-   Vote weighting by NFT tier (e.g., Bronze = 1 vote, Diamond = 10 votes)
    
-   Smart contract logic to simulate redistribution scenarios and visualize impact
    
-   Community fund balance tracker (read from escrow contract logs)
    

This lays the groundwork for decentralized platform governance and collective decision-making around resource allocation.  
  
Other Key Deliverables

-   Escrow automation enhancements: Funds released automatically upon off-chain verification status and milestone signals
    
-   SubQuery indexing for donation history, referral trees, and NFT evolution
    
-   Event-driven notification system: Email/webhook-based milestone alerts, project updates, and vote calls
    

How to measure completion:

-   Dynamic NFT issuance and evolution functional on testnet
    
-   Smart contract-based referral tracking operational
    
-   AI moderation agents reviewing real project drafts
    
-   Simulated fund redistribution flow fully functional
    
-   Quest completion recorded and reflected in NFT metadata
    
-   All campaign types, user types, and contribution actions recorded on SubQuery and queryable from dashboard
    

  
This phase ends with a fully operational product on Stellar testnet, with all user types (donors, creators, admins) having access to a decentralized, data-driven, gamified environment for validating social causes.","Estimated completion: February 2026  
Budget: $35,000 in XLM  

Brief description:  
The Mainnet milestone marks the public launch of KindFi’s platform on the Stellar blockchain.

1.  Anyone to request the creation of a new Spinach competition
    
1.  An admin to manually add a new Spinach competition for a given token to the system
    
1.  A backend to track liquidity orchestrated for a token per participating project
    
1.  Visitors to view a leaderboard of liquidity orchestrated per participating project and paid out rewards so far
    
1.  Projects to receive daily payments for the liquidity they orchestrated the day before
    

  

Once live, Spinach will be the first liquidity incentive platform to go live on Stellar.

-   $20k DeFi TVL on Stellar created for every $1k in rewards distributed through Spinach
    
-   5 participating projects per Spinach Competition
    
-   Participating projects start creating programs with incentives for end users so they can orchestrate more liquidity on Stellar

In the period leading up to the launch, we’ll be speaking with projects on Stellar that have their own token to discuss having them launch a Spinach competition for their tokens. 

  

In addition, we’d like to partner with SDF to incentivize liquidity orchestration by/for new projects participating in SCF rounds. This encourages new projects to optimize for growing TVL and liquidity, which is good for the entire ecosystem. Simultaneously this helps with funding for nascent projects that are gaining some traction.

  

With this three-pronged approach, we intend to establish Spinach as a default ecosystem growth tactic on Stellar.","The Glo Dollar team has been running an excel-based alpha v0.01 of Spinach in the Celo ecosystem and noticed it has been working well within the Glo Dollar context. Through distributing just $2k in builder grants per month we managed to orchestrate $66k in liquidity on Celo, activating 8 projects to participate who rallied over 150 community users to provide liquidity.

  

For evidence of the positive feedback:  
1. Response to announcement https://x.com/glodollar/status/1843638466648985986

2. $19k USDGLO liquidity added in the first month: https://x.com/glodollar/status/1859232965202722860

5. Commons Protocol made an internal proposal to launch a staking program based on Glo Dollar’s Spinach rewards

  

This prompted us to start exploring Spinach as a stand alone product. During the Eth Denver conference in February we spoke with half a dozen projects and chains which we believe might benefit from using Spinach. The response has been positive and encouraging us to build it. We’re now looking to get funding to start building an MVP so that anyone can launch Spinach liquidity competitions for builders on Stellar.

It ingests full classic and Soroban data via Galexie or Stellar RPC, overcoming Horizon's limitations, particularly for complex Soroban event access which is currently difficult for many builders. Developers define Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using our CLI or SDK to chain together stateless, reusable processors (microservices) that apply custom logic – like filtering, enrichment (e.g., with AI), or state calculations. Processed data streams reliably to databases, APIs, alerting systems, or even triggers Soroban contract calls. While core tooling like the CLI and processor templates will be available, developers will primarily deploy and operate these pipelines via a managed Obsrvr Flow platform, simplifying setup and maintenance.

Key features leveraging Stellar/Soroban:

-   Unified Ingestion: Direct access to raw classic ledger data and Soroban events/effects via Galexie or native Stellar RPC.
    
-   Programmable Processors: Build custom logic using reusable, Protobuf-enforced microservices reacting to Stellar operations or Soroban events. Chain, replay, and test processors independently.
    
-   Multi-Sink Routing: Stream processed data reliably to diverse destinations (Postgres, webhooks, Discord, triggering Soroban RPC calls).
    
-   Developer Tooling: CLI and Control Plane SDK (interfacing with the managed platform) for declarative pipeline management, schema registry, real-time observability, and retry queues.
    
-   Public Data Source: We will provide a publicly accessible, Galexie-powered data lake of Stellar ledger data (Mainnet/Testnet) via Google Cloud Storage (Requester Pays) to accelerate ecosystem development.
    

This unified infrastructure is vital for wallet/dApp builders (who currently often build custom indexers), analytics platforms, and custody solutions needing timely, granular, and programmable access to both classic and Soroban activity.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_7yjAfWR3asErRd7c-6U0sIQUiEnIjc/view?usp=sharing,"We will measure success through a combination of adoption, functionality, and ecosystem impact:

Problem we are solving:  
Currently, most DeFi stats on Stellar come from project-provided reports, which are not always transparent or easy to verify. Platforms like DeFi Llama and DappRadar often rely on these reports instead of pulling data directly from the blockchain.

On the other hand, there are many ecosystem stats very useful that can only be calculated using an external tool like Dune Dashboards, like Percentage of Swaps being aggregated, average slippage of swaps and more.  

How DeFi Dune Dashboards Solves this:  
The Stellar DeFi Dune Dashboards will change this by providing fully verifiable, on-chain data from smart contract activity from all DeFi protocols on the ecosystem. These dashboards will track important stats like Weekly and Monthly Active Users, Average Slippage on Trades, Volume Analisis, Percentage of Aggregated Trades, and Liquidity Provider Activity.

For AMMs and aggregators, we will show key insights, including trade volume, slippage, price impact, and how often trades go through aggregators instead of single AMMs. We will also track arbitrage profits and how many trades are related to arbitrage.

This project will make Stellar DeFi data more transparent and accessible for everyone, helping users, developers, and investors understand how healthy and active the ecosystem really is. We will also maintain and update the dashboards for one year to ensure they stay reliable.

  
Extra Comments:

It's important to understand that Dune dashboards need regular maintenance. Over time, some queries can become too large because they are analyzing more and more data. When this happens, we need to export the results into Materialized Views to keep the dashboards fast and reliable.

1.  Once live on mainnet, convert our Letters of Intent with ~$10m institutional sales pipeline into full clients to kickstart Normal Token liquidity
    
1.  Acquire partnership with LumenSwap and/or Aquarius to deploy co-marketing campaigns to attract initial Normal Token traders (including rewards)
    
1.  Build native crypto custodian integrations - enabling any client to easily provide liquidity to or trade Normal Tokens on Stellar (instead of pitching them one-off)
    
1.  Partner with existing Stellar communities like Beans and Decaf to provide their communities with unfiltered access to cryptocurrencies via Normal Tokens","Since our SCF #31 submission, we've scaled our AUM to over $350k from 200+ clients across 30+ countries.

We've also developed the following institutional clients and sales pipeline:

-   Carpathian Capital - $10m AUM crypto hedge fund
    
-   Ronin Digital - $5m AUM crypto hedge fund
    
-   Accuplan - $1.5b AUM crypto IRA provider
    
-   Pipeline - another $5m in AUM","Institutional Portal for the Normal Protocol:

-   Description: We've built the interface for users to swap Normal Tokens on Stellar, but we need to build an interface for institutions to onboard, provide liquidity, and manage their positions supporting Normal Tokens across the Stellar ecosystem.

Normal API Custodian Integrations:

-   Description: To ensure Normal Tokens are always backed 1:1 by Qualified Custodian deposits, we must build integrations into popular custodians like Coinbase Prime and sFOX to monitor partner institution balances. When balances change, this API triggers an appropriate Soroban mint or burn event to maintain a 1:1 backing.
