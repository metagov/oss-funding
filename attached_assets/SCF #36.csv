SendIN,SCF #36,SendIN [Phase 2],SendIN,Applications,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$67000.00,$22333.33,89754.27,6/20/2025,Build,Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments To India,"SendIN is a payments platform built on the Stellar network, designed to revolutionize the process of sending money from the US to India. We make US-to-India money transfers easy, affordable, transparent and lightning-fast without any crypto complexity. Funds can be sent to a recipient‚Äôs email, and INR is delivered directly to their Indian bank account within minutes. While the backend leverages Stellar‚Äôs low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure, the frontend remains entirely Web2-native. No wallets, seed phrases, or tokens required. SendIN brings the benefits of blockchain to users who never need to know it‚Äôs there. The tech‚Äôs complex. The experience isn‚Äôt.

Previously, we were awarded an activation award to build the phase 1 of our MVP on Stellar. We developed a fully functional application that enables a user in the US to send money to an email address, with the receiver in India getting INR directly in their bank account ‚Äî all abstracting away blockchain complexity. Key technical accomplishments include:

1.  A complete full-stack app with secure login, auth stack & database with email ‚Üî wallet mapping.
    
1.  Stellar SDK integration for transactions on the network & creating sponsored addresses.
    
1.  End-to-end money transfer orchestration on Stellar testnet.¬†
    
1.  Partnerships & integrations with on/off-ramp providers (Kado.money, Onramp.money) to bridge USD ‚Üî USDC ‚Üî INR
    
1.  Custodial key management using AWS KMS and delegated signing of transactions
    
1.  Initial implementation of SEP-6 for anchor operations & SEP-12 for KYC storing and passing.
    
1.  Currently accepting users on our waitlist at sendin.app
    

In Phase 2, we‚Äôre evolving SendIN from a functional MVP to a production-grade, corridor-scalable payments platform. A key challenge we faced in Phase 1 was the absence of a reliable Stellar anchor in India. After extensive exploration, we partnered with Onramp.money and collaborated with their team to build infrastructure for non-custodial USDC off-ramping‚Äîbut the service remains SEP non-compliant and lacks full protocol alignment. On the on-ramp side, we had fully integrated with Kado.money, but following its recent acquisition and shift in services, we are now migrating to alternate providers. Phase 2 will address these limitations while expanding our infrastructure, formalizing compliance, and preparing for growth. Features / improvements in this phase include:

1.  Build and deploy India‚Äôs first production-grade Stellar anchor to support off-ramping USDC & XLM ‚Üí INR, including SEP-6, SEP-12, and SEP-31 compatibility.
    
1.  Add dynamic support for multiple on-ramp providers (Banxa, Transak) with backend routing based on user location, availability, and cost.
    
1.  Begin development of a Soroban smart contract layer to enable programmable disbursement logic, revenue-sharing models, and wallet restrictions. All complexity remains fully abstracted from users.
    
1.  Implement passkey-based authentication and migrated to a non-custodial approach by using dfns to use MPC infra for wallets and enhancing security while maintaining seamless UX.
    
1.  Continue onboarding users through the sendin.app waitlist and begin controlled mainnet rollout for transaction flows.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efhFtZHwimFXvQYa7l38adXw9hCUwQ6sRU57J_iD3MA/edit?tab=t.0,"Success for SendIN is defined by both measurable traction and systemic impact.

From a quantitative perspective, we aim to onboard 1000+ users across the US ‚Üí India corridor within 3 months of mainnet launch, facilitating $200,000+ in cumulative remittance volume. This initial traction will validate product-market fit and prove that web2-native users can adopt a blockchain-powered backend without friction. We expect a growing share of users to be freelancers, remote workers, and NRIs with family ties in India; audiences underserved by traditional remittance channels.

However, the deeper success lies in expanding access. By removing the need for crypto wallets, seed phrases, or exchange accounts, we‚Äôre onboarding entirely new cohorts into on-chain finance. The user experience is fully abstracted; money moves on Stellar, but users stay in their comfort zone.

On the infrastructure side, success includes the launch of India‚Äôs first SEP-compliant Stellar anchor which is currently a critical missing link in the ecosystem. We are positive that we could also market out the anchor at some point, which then could potentially be adapted by a lot of on-chain products in India",https://sendin.app/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyjobz-N5fBtZEruzPZ23wYjIdxLSWUfLainYLRsPYM/edit?tab=t.0,https://youtu.be/0q1SO3j_40k,Yes,"SendIN will launch in four strategic phases, focused on the US ‚Üí India remittance corridor, followed by groundwork for UAE expansion. Each phase targets a specific user group, validates infrastructure, and incrementally scales product adoption.

Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP (Early Q3 2025):  
Launch a minimal product to a small group of pilot users, enabling USD ‚Üí INR remittances via email. Key goals: complete real transfers using Stellar infrastructure,¬† validate compliance (KYC, transaction flow), and gather UX feedback.

Phase 2 ‚Äì Closed Beta (Late Q3 2025):  
Onboard select freelancers, expats, and early adopters from partner networks. Optimize flows and transaction reliability with real-world usage. Referral-based onboarding begins. KYC and INR disbursement experience refined with small-value transfers.

Phase 3 ‚Äì Full Launch US ‚Üí India (Q4 2025):  
Launch to the public with full Web2-native UX and Stellar mainnet infrastructure. Users can send USD to emails; INR lands in recipient bank accounts within minutes. Roll out in-app referrals, transparent pricing, and FX efficiency as core value props.

Phase 4 ‚Äì UAE ‚Üí India Groundwork (Q1 2026):  
Begin integrating multi-currency backend logic and initiate partnerships with UAE-based payment providers. Build compliance readiness for corridor expansion.  
  
Acquisition Channels:

-   Partner with freelancer platforms (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr)
    
-   In-app referral incentives for NRI users and diaspora communities
    
-   Tie-ups with alumni networks, Indian expat orgs
    
-   BD with remote payroll tools (e.g. Deel)
    
-   Content marketing on cost-saving, remittance pain points","SendIN was awarded an SCF Activation Award during SCF #27, which allowed us to build and rigorously test an almost full-featured prototype on Stellar testnet. Since then, our project has steadily validated both technical and market feasibility. To date, over 550 users have joined our waitlist, primarily Indian-origin freelancers, remote workers, and expats. This growth has been entirely organic: driven through Discord, fintech Twitter, diaspora communities, and word of mouth, without any paid marketing. For privacy and compliance reasons, we are unable to share individual user data publicly, but we maintain all relevant KYC and waitlist submissions securely on our backend.

To further validate user needs, we conducted 30+ structured interviews with potential angel users and stakeholders in the remittance space, which shaped our onboarding and product design. These conversations revealed deep dissatisfaction with existing payment rails and strong excitement for a faster / cheaper experience. We found out people don‚Äôt really care about the tech behind given that it‚Äôs powerful & safe.

On the institutional side, we've also been approached by multiple early-stage VCs and fintech scouts, intrigued by our positioning at the intersection of Web2 usability and blockchain-native infra. These conversations are ongoing but signal real interest from the capital side once we‚Äôre closer to mainnet traction.

SendIN was also invited to pitch at Stellar Meridian 2024 in London, where the project received enthusiastic feedback from members of the Stellar Development Foundation, ecosystem founders, and protocol engineers. Together, these signals, a growing waitlist, structured validation, ecosystem visibility, and investor interest, reflect early traction for a product that solves a real, painful problem in a $15B+ corridor.","Deliverable 1: Passkey-Based Auth & Delegated Signing

Sentinel Protocol ,SCF #36,Flight Delay Parametric Insurance,,Applications,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$128000.00,$42666.67,147421.39,7/10/2025,Build,"Parametric insurance framework for any risk, starting with flight delay coverage using reliable oracles and smart contract payouts","Traditional indemnity insurance is pulling back in the face of rising climate risks. In 2024, climate-related disasters caused 94 billion dollars in U.S. losses, according to NOAA. Major insurers like State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers have exited or paused new business in states like California. Chubb, Travelers, and USAA each reported over 1 billion dollars in wildfire-related losses. As a result, parametric insurance is gaining traction as a faster and more transparent alternative. The California State Assembly recognized its potential in a recent insurance reform report.

Sentinel Protocol is a modular parametric insurance framework built on the Soroban blockchain. It connects users seeking protection with DeFi investors who underwrite risk in exchange for yield. Smart contracts and decentralized oracles automate claims and payouts, removing intermediaries and ensuring transparency at every step.

The protocol can support any real-world risk where reliable oracle data is available. Our first product is Flight Delay Insurance, which pays users automatically if their flight is delayed beyond a set threshold. The product launches first on Testnet, followed by a Closed Beta on Mainnet, with a streamlined user interface for travelers and a dashboard for capital providers.

We began with the Kickstart Grant, which helped us validate Sentinel‚Äôs technical foundation. While we have made meaningful progress, there is still much to build. You can find a detailed update on our technical progress and roadmap in the Technical section.

Built natively on Soroban, Sentinel Protocol uses:

-   Soroban Smart Contracts to automate all core operations including deposits, claims, and payouts.
    
-   Acurast Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to deliver real-time, tamper-resistant data to the blockchain.
    
-   Stellar SDKs used to connect liquidation bots and keepers that advance the protocol's state and coordinate interactions seamlessly.
    

We are open-sourcing the Sentinel Protocol framework to support the Soroban developer community, offering reusable components like modular vaults, oracle pipelines for Web2 data, and automation tools such as liquidation bots and keepers. Alongside this, we‚Äôre releasing documentation, tutorials, and videos to help others build or extend Sentinel for new DeFi use cases. The framework is flexible and designed for easy deployment of parametric insurance products across diverse risk markets, with the goal of disrupting traditional insurance and enabling others to build on top of it.

Our market contract includes a configurable commission fee that allows the deployer to earn revenue as a creator or intermediary. Whether we plan to monetize the open-source framework by charging other teams is still open for discussion and experimentation.

In short, Sentinel Protocol provides the following:

-   For the developer community:
    
    -   A reusable ERC-4626 style vault standard for any DeFi project on Soroban
        
    -   Oracle integration using Acurast TEE to securely fetch Web2 API data
        
        -   Among the first implementations bringing Acurast to Soroban
            
        -   Expands oracle capabilities beyond on-chain asset prices (e.g., flight data, fire zones)
            
    -   Example liquidation bots and keepers to automate contract state progression
        
    -   Full developer support with documentation, tutorials, and example integrations
        
-   For DeFi yield seekers:
    
    -   Earn yield by underwriting real-world risks
        
    -   Transparent vaults with automated payouts
        
    -   Uncorrelated returns tied to actual insurance demand
        
-   For insurance buyers:
    
    -   Easy-to-use UI to purchase protection
        
    -   Instant, automated payouts triggered by real data

-   Developers benefit from a standardized Vault primitive and a modular oracle pipeline for bringing verifiable Web2 non-financial data on-chain via Acurast TEEs.
    
-   The protocol is ready to onboard other teams building insurance products in new verticals, including but not limited to fire coverage, hail damage, crop yield protection, and earthquake insurance.",https://sentinel-finance.vercel.app/,https://github.com/SentinelFi#-sentinel-protocol-repositories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GoTO3bqBcw,Yes,"We have an ambitious goal: to disrupt the parametric insurance market by leveraging Soroban to bring transparency, automation, and trustless execution to an industry that remains opaque and slow. While six months and a limited budget are not enough to realize the full vision, this phase gives us a strong foundation to prove product-market fit, engage early partners, onboard beta testers, and demonstrate the viability of on-chain insurance.

As we move forward, we are laying out the next evolution of the Sentinel framework and developing clear strategies to capture market share across high-impact insurance verticals.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans for the Framework

-   Integrate Reclaim Protocol or similar zkTLS frameworks to enable zero-knowledge proofs of personhood and actions like flight ticket purchases.
    
-   Join accelerators like Draper University, Tachyon, or a16z Crypto Startup School to raise funding, and grow the team for accelerated development.
    
-   Explore additional TEE platforms like Phala Network and Lit Protocol to ensure flexibility and long-term reliability beyond Acurast.
    
-   Build a more resilient Oracle layer by averaging data from multiple APIs to improve accuracy and reduce dependency on single sources.
    

üìà Ideas to Capture Market Share

-   Target flight insurance for major crypto events like Token2049, ETHDenver, and Devcon‚Äîwhere crypto-native travelers are highly concentrated. Explore partnerships with ETHGlobal to include our coverage in their ‚ÄúHacker Pack‚Äù or ‚ÄúCity Pack‚Äù offerings. Here's an example - Denver pack.
    
-   Form partnerships with travel platforms like Expedia to offer flight delay and weather-proof vacation insurance directly to travelers at the point of booking.
    
-   Initially, launch our own Chrome extension to bypass partnership dependencies and directly offer users flight and weather insurance, with built-in incentives to encourage adoption.
    
-   Position Sentinel as the default backend for on-chain insurance startups by offering plug-and-play tooling to launch new markets. Sponsor hackathons to encourage teams to build insurance products on top of our framework.
    
-   After the Closed Beta launch, host regular X Spaces and grow a vibrant Discord community to drive awareness, onboard users, and engage DeFi-native participants interested in underwriting risk.
    
-   Launch domain-specific verticals (e.g. wildfire protection in California, hail damage in the Midwest) based on real-world demand and high-risk conditions.
    
-   Partner with influencers and climate advocacy groups to raise awareness and drive adoption of insurance products targeting climate-related risks and extreme weather events.
    
-   Offer capital incentives to early insurance underwriters, particularly in new markets with high yield potential.
    
-   Develop tailored onboarding flows and educational content for specific user segments (e.g., small farmers, remote workers, frequent flyers).","The global parametric insurance market was valued at 16.2 billion USD in 2024 and is projected to grow at a 12.6 percent CAGR through 2034, according to Global Market Insights. Our first product targets the flight delay insurance market, valued at 1.37 billion USD in 2024, growing at 14.5 % CAGR, per Business Research Insights. We aim to capture early market share by getting real users into live parametric markets‚Äîstarting with Flight Delay Insurance.

Since receiving the Kickstart Grant, our two-person developer team has been focused on shipping. We‚Äôve made significant technical progress on Sentinel Protocol, a modular on-chain insurance framework built on Soroban. Highlights include:

-   Built a modular ERC-4626 equivalent vault standard, ready for internal use. View the repo.
    
    -   ERC‚Äë4626 style vault contracts are rapidly gaining adoption, with usage up 32.23% since October 2024 according to Glider data by Hexensio (source). This shows that developers are increasingly looking for shared, plug-and-play standards for interest-bearing assets. It's a strong signal that Soroban has an opportunity to capture this momentum by supporting DeFi protocols that rely on vault primitives.
        
-   Collaborating with OpenZeppelin to contribute the vault to their Soroban token library. Opened Issue, PR to follow
    
-   Integrated Acurast TEE with Soroban for secure Web2 data feeds. Integration code
    

We‚Äôve also validated real use cases and built functional prototypes:

-   We have built Hedge/Risk Market based on vault primitive. Contract Code
    
-   General Hedge and Risk Market UI built and ready for testing, designed to support multiple parametric insurance markets including Flight Delay Insurance. View UI and the UI Code
    
-   Fire Insurance prototype using NASA FIRMS satellite data on top of our framework to demonstrate that given oracle data, we can build Parametric Insurance (Hedge Market) on any vertical. Project link
    
-   We‚Äôve engaged with teams exploring new verticals on top of the Sentinel framework, including a project focused on crop insurance for drought risk in West Africa - they are in the process of applying to Kickstarter Round 11.
    
-   We conducted 12 user interviews at ETHDenver 2025, and during the Kickstart Week including DeFi yield seekers and insurance buyers.
    

Early simulations show strong yield potential across multiple insurance verticals, indicating a sustainable model for risk investors:

-   Flight delay insurance, modeled using over 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with delay probabilities from 1% to 20%, shows a median yield of 96.11% at a 3-hour delay threshold. Flight delay yield analysis
    
-   1,000 properties with $3,000 annual premiums and $150,000 payouts were simulated with fire probabilities between 0.3% and 1.7%. Across thousands of runs, the average annual yield ranged from 40% to 50%, showing consistent profitability despite risk variability.. Fire Insurance Yield analysis
    

With the Build Award, we will complete the remaining infrastructure and then shift our focus to onboarding insurance buyers and capital providers‚Äîtesting live markets, validating sustainable yields, and accelerating real-world adoption.","'-   Total Budget: $41,600
    
-   Timeline: 6-7 weeks after receiving funds
    

#### 1. Smart Contract & Architecture Changes ‚Äì $19,200

-   Implement the Central Risk Vault Architecture, replacing per-market risk vaults with a single pooled vault that supports multiple Hedge Vaults, improving capital efficiency and investor exposure. Technical Documentation
    
-   Re-evaluate the Hedge Vault design to explore enhancements like dynamic pricing or pooled buyer tranches, aimed at optimizing capital use and user experience for insurance buyers.
    
-   Timeline: 5-6 weeks after receiving funds
    
-   Completion Criteria: The new Controller contract and Market Maker have been deployed. New markets are now being created with individual Hedge Vaults, all connected to a single, centralized Risk Vault. The architecture is currently passing internal tests.
    

#### 2. Purpose-Built Flight Delay Insurance Interface ‚Äì $16,000

-   Timeline: 5-6 weeks after receiving funds
    
-   Completion Criteria: The UI for Flight Delay Insurance has been fully redesigned, moving away from a generalized Hedge/Risk Market interface to a purpose-built experience. Insurance Buyers and Risk Investors now have dedicated dashboards, offering intuitive deposit and withdrawal flows for investors, and a streamlined coverage purchase flow for buyers. Liquidation events and oracle-triggered data are clearly displayed, enhancing transparency across the system.
    

#### 3. Acurast Oracle Integration Documentation - $1,600

-   A key innovation from our Kickstarter phase was integrating Acurast Oracles with Soroban using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

Community-driven growth will be encouraged through referral programs, and active participation in Stellar forums, Discord, and social media channels.

3. Iterative Product Development and Scaling

We will employ a data-driven approach, using analytics and user feedback to prioritize feature enhancements and address pain points rapidly.

Post-launch, we will expand our marketing efforts to include partnerships with fintech influencers, content marketing, and participation in industry events to increase visibility and credibility.

As traction builds, we will explore additional distribution channels, including integration with third-party platforms and business development with enterprise clients.

Milestones and Metrics

Beta Launch: Within 1-2 months post-funding, targeting a core group of users for feedback and validation.

Public Launch: After incorporating beta feedback, a broader rollout with PR, social campaigns, and ecosystem events.

Growth Tracking: Key metrics will include user adoption rates, transaction volumes, partner integrations, and community engagement levels.

Sustainable Growth

We will continuously engage with the Stellar Community Fund network for mentorship, funding opportunities (such as the Build and Growth Awards), and ecosystem support to sustain momentum and drive long-term impact.

This multi-phased, ecosystem-centric go-to-market plan ensures that our project not only launches successfully but also achieves meaningful adoption and contributes to the broader Stellar mission.","Production Alpha Testing

There, we discovered that high transaction fees frustrated many users, prompting us to prioritize affordability. This experience, aligned with Stellar‚Äôs mission of accessible finance, gave birth to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Since launching in March 2023, we‚Äôve achieved the following metrics while bootstrapping, with our P2P feature and payment system going live in Q4 2024 after wining Stellar Kickstart grant of $15,000. Beside User Growth, all data provided is from Q4 2024 to April 2025, reflecting rapid early growth:

User Growth: Acquired 14,210 users organically (zero CAC) through social media, referrals, events, and word of mouth from March 2023 to April 2025, leading to 1,795 Active Users. This represents a 12.6% conversion rate from acquired users to active users.

Transactions: Processed $75,000 across 1,967 transactions, averaging $38 per transaction.

Revenue: Generated $1,360 from a 1.1%‚Äì1.6% transaction fee depending on the transaction type and 50% of revenue from an ad-driven reward system, where users earn incentives for engaging with ads to offset transaction fees. This early revenue validates our model‚Äôs potential.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): We are actively calculating LTV as we refine our monetization strategy with early estimates at $10 per active user based on transaction frequency.

Despite limited resources, we‚Äôve maintained lean operations by leveraging free marketing channels and are exploring partnerships with local fintechs, telcos and small business owners to scale user acquisition. Moving forward, we plan to boost our activation rate to 20% through enhanced onboarding with in-app tutorials and scale revenue to $5,000 monthly by Q3 2025 by introducing new revenue streams.

Meanwhile, we are excited to share a mainnet demo we released for our integration so far.","Kindly find the link to our overall budget here for a detailed breakdown.

We provide builders a single place to go to access all the data providers they need to build, while saving them money and headaches with our proprietary smart-routing algorithms.","Uniblock gives developers the ""batteries included"" experience. Our tooling brings together different data providers and enable builders to simplify their tech stack and the operational complexity they need to manage as they build and operate their projects.

We provide a single place to go to access all the data needed. This can be APIs to check transaction history, token price, market data, and more. We are also able to stitch together the various data providers to create a wholistic experience -- for example, when SimpleHash was acquired recently and went offline, our users were able to continue without disruption as we brought endpoints from 6 different providers into one place to provide 98% coverage for the gap that SimpleHash left. Without Uniblock, developers need to struggle to talk to each of the different providers, read all of their documentation, and then contract and pay monthly invoices from all the different providers they work with.

Our business is in understanding the data provider landscape, negotiating the best enterprise agreements, and bringing it all together into a simple and easy to use experience for developers. And on top of that, we add an AI routing layer that intelligently routes data requests to the provider that is offering the best price and best latency. We also automatically detect failures and outages and move project data requests to the next-best provider; minimizing outages and downtime that affect the end-users of applications, while also taking away the need for projects to build this redundancy (and the need to pay for backups that may never be used) away from projects.

Additional Information added: 
1. With indexers such as Goldsky, we will run 1 indexer account in Uniblock backend. We will then allow users to have one billing system under Uniblock without having to pay for a separate indexer account. We will wrap around the indexer CLI and create a new Uniblock-indexer CLI to provide all functionalities. In addition, we will create a copy of indexer query studio for graphql queries

2. While most Stellar Horizon providers truncated its historical data to one year, as long as there exists providers that provide complete historical data, we can aggregate it. For example, we can work with Bitquery https://explorer.bitquery.io/stellar/operations and other similar api providers as backup

3. The value of Uniblock, and the issue in the industry that we are solving for developers, is that we eliminate the need to have costly secondary and tertiary agreements with other providers that are only used in the event of an outage of the primary provider.¬†

Uniblock's infrastructure is run on GCP (Google) and has benefits from this stable, as near as possible to 100%, uptime. Our customers do not need additional providers as Uniblock is more stable than even having 2, 3, or even more backup RPC providers.",https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ffc4041w3orjg0LLCmYaFCgdVXXapPcPhmEdXEyTcDM/edit?usp=drive_link,"Qualitatively, success for Uniblock on Stellar looks like hundreds or thousands of builders on Stellar using Uniblock to support their data needs. It looks like builders not having to struggle with different transaction streams across Stellar and Soroban, it looks like a better experience and more complete data for indexers, it looks like builders saving money money over month as they benefit from our auto-router, sending their requests for data to the best priced and best performant data providers.

Quantitatively, we are happy to work with Stellar to define particular metrics as it relates to either usage of specific providers, unification and usage of specific types of tools (e.g., RPCs, Indexers, API providers), levels of engagement as it relates to our ecosystem of builders using Uniblock on other chains, etc. We want Stellar to see immediate value from Uniblock integration, and will work with you to define the metrics that are important to you, and use the funding available to us to pursue those metrics.",https://www.uniblock.dev/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVhX2BGX_GKY2wTHBW2B1-YEVP5wRnfKcjCS09T3IUw/edit?usp=drive_link,https://youtu.be/rXA7-rWddKo,Yes,"Uniblock has an existing go-to-market strategy that encompasses:

Meta Contracts in Stellar,SCF #36,First batch of Meta Contracts,,Infrastructure & Services,,Information Collection,,,$26400.00,$0.00,0.0,,Build,A set of Meta Contracts apps developers can use to make complex contract invocations without needing to deploy their own contracts,"A set of ""Meta Contracts"" developers can use thanks to a Typescript SDK that makes the process easier. In total, we will introduce 4 (plus the one already created), having different contracts for each type allows developers to just pick the one they need instead of loading one big heavier contract. These contracts are:

-   Atomic call (the one already created): A contract that executes multiple calls in the same contract call and throws an error if one of them fails, this simulates the way in the classic side an app can execute multiple operations with the safety of rejecting the whole transaction if one of them fails.
    
-   Optional succeed call: A contract that lets you send multiple contract calls without where you can decide if it's ok for some of them to fail, an example where this might be useful is when an arbitrager wants to send multiple calls where the goal is to get as many as possible accepting if one or more of them fail.
    
-   Conditional calls: A contract that lets developers execute transactions where based on the result from one of the calls it decides what to do next, this allows simulating a classic ""if this then that"" logic.
    
-   Chain flow call: A contract that lets you take the result of one call and inject that result into the following contract call.
    
-   Mega call: A contract that has all of the other contract features included and lets the developer use them in the configuration needed, this will be in fact the heavier contract but there are situations where it helps. For example, a developer wants to withdraw from a pool and after that, it wants to get the balances from two assets to later use the result from both calls to fund another different pool, all of that will be possible without that developer needing to upload its own contract.",https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Router-Contract,"If others main protocols use them that will be a success, for example we could use one of them with the Blend front end in order to reduce the amount of simulations calls when fetching all the balances from the RPCs.",https://jsr.io/@creit-tech/stellar-router-sdk,https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Router-SDK,https://null.com,Yes,"Meta contract are inmutable contracts that once they are deployed they are all set and no other plan is needed, once they are public we will follow the same we have done with our other libraries like the Stellar Wallets Kit where we share them in our socials and show them to other developers (that beside using them in our own products).","It all started from a tweet from Tomer that gave us the idea of more ""meta contracts"" that could be created, the first one was a router that allows developers to ""simulate"" the atomicity of the classic side on Soroban, but it was created to test an idea from Leigh shared in the Stellar discord regarding fetching multiple balances without needing to do multiple simulations (something useful for our smart wallet). Because it's pretty recent there isn't much traction beside our apps integrating it.","Target: The creation of the ""Optional succeed call"" contract and the ""Conditional calls"" contract with the updates in the SDK to support them.

It integrates with AI tools that assess whether a business respects regulations like GDPR, the EU AI Act, and other emerging AI governance frameworks.

These compliance certificates are issued as non-transferable NFTs and recorded on a decentralized registry, making them instantly verifiable by regulators, auditors, or partners. The platform is particularly suited for AI systems used in high-stakes environments ‚Äî such as finance, healthcare, or legal ‚Äî where transparency, traceability, and protection against fraud or misuse are essential.

We chose Stellar not just for its technical reliability, but because it is a robust and institution-focused blockchain, already used in regulated environments such as banking and financial services.

By providing a unified knowledge base of common vulnerabilities and best practices, developers can focus on building using Soroban safely.","Products & Services:

Soroban vulnerability information is fragmented across multiple channels. There is no unified, searchable, community-driven platform aggregating all Soroban vulnerability reports. Our team at Inferara will create a Soroban knowledge base with a web based user interface.

Product Features:

-   Usable Information: Aggregate existing Soroban Security reports, audits and vulnerability data
    
    -   Through advanced filtering & classification provide powerful search and filter capabilities.
        
    -   Things such as: filter vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low), type/category (overflow, access control, logic bug, etc.), affected project or contract, date, and other criteria.
        
    -   Provide a nice and useful Web UI
        

Each vulnerability entry is classified with metadata to support granular filtering and sorting.

-   Organized Data: Provide advanced search, filtering, classificaiton by seveirty, type, project / platform origin and so on
    
    -   Research is useless if you can't find an answer. We will collect, organize and maintain this information.
        
-   Knowledge Transfer: Encourage knowledge & best practices sharing between Stellar users, developers and experts
    
    -   Once interest, usage and content of the knowledge base is refined we hope it will be THE link people share with new builders instead of a random collection of links that happen to be on the mind of the informer at the time. One direct starting point.
        
-   Moderated Community Submissions: Encourage community contributions of new findings or reports while ensuring data integrity through moderation
    
    -   User account creation
        
    -   Role system: Admins, contributors, moderators & viewers Community submissions and support is greatly encouraged. Due to security reasons we want to ensure that the reported data is accurate to maintain security for the Stellar ecosystem.
        

We also understand the use of Stella in the Stellar Developers discord.

If we are able to freely access the api of Stella we will further integrate it with the knowledge base.

Some of these additional features might include:

-   Additional sources for Stella to utilize. While writing this submission Stella was helpful, but did not point us to many relevant up-to-date resources
    
-   More accurate & defined descriptions to educate users with
    

We believe access to this knowledge and continuous knowledge transfer will create a succicnt starting point not just for new users; also a place for experts to return to and share their extensive knowledge without unneccesary obfuscation. It will highlight common vulnerability patterns and recommended mitigations, helping developers avoid known mistakes. Important data such as vulnerabilities, edge cases and uncommon errors should not require extensive time to discover. As information is currently fragmented across various channels, we hope this knowledge base will remove a lot of friction for existing developers, auditors and Stellar projects.

Services:

-   Continuity: We will maintain, host and monitor the Security Catalogue
    
-   Report: As new security flaws, hacks or other issues occur we will highlight their impact
    
-   Educate: Provide the resources necessary for existing & new developers on Stellar to avoid common vulnerabilities

Ecosystem Security Tool usage & Awareness Community Engagement

Ecosystem Security-

By providing access to security reports, common issues and vulnerabilties in a unified, organized manner, it will be be a tremendous resource for the Soroban developer community.

It will be a direct place to point to for maintaining Stellar security. By flagging and understanding potential issues, we can secure Stellar even further.

Tool usage & Awareness -

Having developers using and sharing content from the knowledge base will be important.

We can also observe the amount of registered accounts & website visits.

Community Engagement-

Receiving valuable feedback from developers, users and Stellar projects is crucial.

We want to build a tool that will be used, improved and help prevent critical errors, not another impractical site that goes unused.",https://github.com/Inferara/soroban-security-catalogue,https://github.com/Inferara/soroban-security-catalogue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brnYC6PXzeA,Yes,"Our go-to-market plan is a bit different than traditional products and services on Soroban. This type of development tooling is focusing specificially on curating data, educating users and engaging with the community to use it. The main 2 users are individual developers & auditors. Both of these include experts to Soroban as well as newer users. The experts can stay aware of existing & future vulnerabilities, whereas the newer developers can benefit from a well documented set of resources to start their development journey using Soroban.

Though individual use cases for the Security Catalog can vary greatly, we have identified some key ways we will reach users.

For developers:

-   Direct access to the knowledge base
    
-   Inform developers via Stellar developer discord, webinars & in person events
    
-   Participate in Stellar developer meetings
    
-   Provide existing documentation support & maintenance for Inference
    
-   Create educational content to showcase how to apply the informaiton in the security catalog (Videos, articles etc.)
    
-   Further engage with the community through discord & other relevant channels
    

For Auditors:

-   Similar actions as above, simply curated to auditors
    
-   Provide ecosystem reports of common issues we discover in order to educate potential users & existing auditors
    

For Others:

-Get them to help spread the word :)","Traction Evidence:

Being a rather new concept our traction is still building. We hope to bring more attention to this topic as more opportunities to disuss it arise. As we are building the Security Catalog for Soroban users, we hope to hear feedback from Stellar users in order to collaborate!

Here are some interested individuals on our post in the #ideas-rfp section of the Stellar Developers Discord https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1373603762924556340

Our team has a strong foundation of experience and knowledge even outside the scope of this particular project.

We will divert our attention from our current research of the inference programming language to focus on this security knowledge base. Since verification driven programming is extremely niche and complex topic, we believe it's best to showcase our capabilities in a way that is easier understood first. That is why we are focusing first on tools & information that can be readily used by Stellar developers. That tool being this Security Catalogue.

Blux,SCF #36,Blux React &amp; JS packages and Dashboard,,Developer Tooling,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$81000.00,$27000.00,108719.46,6/24/2025,Build,Provides a complete Stellar wallet kit to help apps onboard users with or without a wallet and interact with Stellar blockchain.,"Blux is a frontend package that helps developers integrate Stellar support into their applications. It takes care of logins, transaction signing, sending and receiving assets, on and off ramping, user analytics, and provides a set of custom hooks and helper functions that make it faster and easier to build on Stellar. By abstracting away low-level wallet integrations and offering a simple but flexible setup, Blux reduces development time and lowers the barrier for developers looking to build applications on Stellar, which in turn helps expand the network with more usable, polished tools.

Blux starts with a login modal that acts as the main entry point for users. This is where users choose how they want to log in, and it supports all the major Stellar wallets like Freighter, Albedo, xBull, and more. Developers can customize this modal fully‚Äîchanging the layout, logo, color theme, or even the order of wallets shown. Blux also supports cold wallets like Ledger and Trezor, allowing for broader access and improved security for power users. This range of supported wallets, along with customization options, helps developers create user-friendly login experiences that match the look and feel of their app, ultimately making Stellar more accessible to new and returning users.

Once a user logs in, they are shown a profile modal. This modal includes useful features like sending and receiving tokens, viewing transaction history, seeing asset balances, and accessing on and off ramps. Features like asset swapping and viewing recent operations will be added soon. These built-in features allow users to interact with Stellar directly within the application without needing to jump to external tools or manage transactions manually, which improves user retention and creates a smoother, more complete Stellar app experience.

Under the hood, Blux provides a full set of custom React hooks like useBalance, useAccount, useTransactions, useOperations, and useSendTransaction, as well as many others. These hooks allow developers to pull real-time data from Horizon and Soroban without having to write boilerplate code or manage state manually. For teams that don‚Äôt use React, Blux also offers a vanilla JavaScript version with the same core features. Both versions are published on NPM and are fully open source. These tools give developers easier access to real-time Stellar data and allow for cleaner, more reliable app logic, helping developers of all skill levels build on Stellar faster and with fewer errors.

All apps built with Blux can be managed through the Blux Dashboard at https://dashboard.blux.cc. This is where developers can register their apps and generate their API keys, configure allowed domains, set up allowlists to make apps invite-only, and use blocklists to restrict access from specific accounts, regions, emails, or phone numbers. The dashboard also allows developers to change visual themes, add terms of service prompts, and control login options. These settings give developers full control over the behavior and accessibility of their apps, which increases security, enables experimentation, and gives app creators more confidence to build on Stellar.

The developer dashboard also includes a ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù tab that provides a snapshot of user activity. Developers can view how many users logged in over time, which wallets were used, where the users came from, and at what times they accessed the application. This data helps developers understand their audience and monitor usage trends, which is valuable for making improvements, pitching to investors, and building user-first Stellar apps that serve real needs.

To help onboard users who don‚Äôt have a wallet or don‚Äôt understand crypto, Blux supports logins via email and SMS. This feature uses OTPs and works even in test environments, allowing developers to quickly simulate flows during local development. By making it possible to log in without a wallet, Blux helps onboard non-technical users and opens the door to a wider audience that might otherwise be intimidated by crypto tools, increasing the potential reach of Stellar apps.

Blux also supports login through passkeys, as well as social login providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and more. These accounts are linked to Stellar accounts behind the scenes, allowing users to sign and send transactions even if they don‚Äôt know anything about blockchain. This gives developers an easy way to build apps for mainstream users while still relying on the core Stellar tech stack, helping bring Stellar to people outside of the crypto-native crowd.

The documentation is being finalized and will walk developers through every step of integrating Blux, from installation to customization, including how to use all the hooks, helpers, and platform features. The goal is to provide a clear path for anyone who wants to use Stellar in their project. This improves developer onboarding, reduces confusion, and increases the chances that projects built on Stellar will succeed and stay active.

Blux is fully open source, and all of its code is published across multiple repositories on GitHub. Unlike some wallet infrastructure tools like Privy, we believe in transparency and invite the Stellar community to look at how everything works, open issues, suggest improvements, or contribute code. This helps build trust in the tools powering Stellar apps and gives developers more confidence that the platform is secure, maintained, and future-proof.

Customization is a key priority in Blux. Developers can even define and plug in their own login methods if the built-in options don‚Äôt meet their needs. This flexibility ensures that Blux is compatible with any kind of Stellar app, whether it‚Äôs a DeFi tool, a payments platform, an NFT project, or something else entirely. Supporting such a wide range of use cases helps foster innovation in the Stellar ecosystem and ensures that developers aren‚Äôt limited by rigid tools.

Blux is completely free to use for now. In the future, we plan to offer advanced features in the developer dashboard that will be part of a paid version. These features will not replace or restrict the existing free functionality and will be announced publicly when ready.

","Web3 upgrade: Enter Interlinked.

Interlinked is a decentralized short link platform powered by Soroban and the Stellar blockchain. It implements subscription-based model and makes URLs smarter, safer and more transparent by storing them directly on-chain:

-   Short URLs
    
    Users can generate both permanent and temporary links via website or API. Link data is stored on-chain and the duration of temporary links can be customized while being powered by the Soroban smart contracts.
    
-   Community-based moderation
    
    As the links are stored publicly on-chain, this provides an opportunity for a bounty program, where users can flag suspicious links. In case the link turns out to be malicious, the user that found it gets rewarded.
    
-   Visual analytics dashboard
    
    Track clicks, user behaviour, and campaign performance through a rich visual dashboard - all powered by transparent, on-chain data. The amount of clicks is tracked by transferring assets for each redirect - making the whole process transparent and promoting Interlinked for marketing with pay-per-click model.
    
-   No-Code Plugin Integrations
    
    Integration with Wix and Shopify makes it easy for E-commerce businesses to integrate Interlinked and drive further adoption of Soroban.
    

Impact on Stellar

-   Admins will review and block links and accounts suspected in malicious activity.
    
-   Using smart contract ensures that no data can be deleted or changed in case of a cyberattack.
    

Open-source commitment:

-   The core smart contract is already open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, available on GitHub.
    
-   All future updates will be published in real-time, not post-launch.
    
-   Development happens in public with:
    
    -   Open-sourced Github
        
    -   A contributor channel in our Discord to support new devs and onboard contributors.
        

Go-to-market:

Pre-launch:

-   Connect with companies on conferences, LinkedIn and Stellar community.","Trend validation:

The URL-shortening industry powers everything from social medias to E-commerce with a market cap of $8 billion. Yet, the market shows a need in a more cost-effective and better product:

-   Web3 shorteners like w3.do and durl.dev already exist - proving demand for decentralized alternatives
    
-   Stellar has no Web3-native URL shortener, despite Soroban‚Äôs potential in terms of speed, transaction fees and more.
    
-   Trend alignment: Interlinked is at the intersection of two rising trends:
    
    -   The URL-shortening market is projected to reach $30 billion by 2033.
        
    -   Adoption of Web3 infrastructure is accelerating due to growing concerns around censorship, ownership, and transparency.
        
-   Competitive edge: Due to Soroban's storage model and data being read directly from the ledger, Interlinked has a much lower cost for operating and maintaining.
    

Partnerships & Early adoption:

Birdhouse Technology, a Stellar-based RWA platform, has actively used Interlinked for social media posts, attracting 60+ on-chain clicks over the last week.

-   Clicks and transaction history is publicly available on stellar expert: https://inl.one/ha/9. To find the amount of clicks for each link: simply check the amount of assets with the unique link code!
    
-   Social media post example: https://inl.one/ha/aa
    

Additionally, it has received early interest from:

1.  APS money(https://aps.money/): A global payment system with over 10 million total transactions processed. Listed as one of the Stellar anchors: https://anchors.stellar.org/.
    
1.  Local Express(https://localexpress.io/): A US-based E-commerce grocery platform for food retailers.
    

These signals indicate real-world interest and use cases within payments, marketing, and commerce even before mainnet launch.

Early traction:

In under two months, Interlinked has gone from a concept to a functional product: feel free to try the MVP on our website and check out the following features:

-   Short link generation with a clean UI.
    
-   Soroban-powered click tracking.
    
-   Webauth login using biometrics and private key generation.
    
-   Publicly-available smart contract deployed on Stellar testnet.
    

All links are written on-chain using Soroban, with click tracking tied to the number of tokens for each unique shortened code. While still early, our testnet service has already recorded over 100 clicks - entirely organic.","Since our previous submission, we have already implemented several core features of the MVP:

LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-chain Oracle,SCF #36,LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-Chain Oracle,LiquidsFi: Bridge and Cross-chain Oracle,Financial Protocols,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$108000.00,$36000.00,144959.28,6/24/2025,Build,"LiquidsFi is a decentralized, secure liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity and on-chain data between multiple EVM chains and Soroban. It provides the Soroban ecosystem with a reliable way to bridge crypto assets from various EVM chains.","LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity across siloed blockchains. It is powered by a decentralized oracle relay network infrastructure and focuses on bridging assets securely and cost-effectively between EVM-compatible chains and Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem.

Interoperability has long been a challenge in blockchain development. Many existing solutions prioritize asset transfers between isolated chains, often introducing a single point of failure. While oracle-based inter-chain messaging protocols like Chainlink help relay data across chains, they primarily support EVM-based blockchains, leaving non-EVM ecosystems like Soroban without robust interoperability options.

LiquidsFi addresses this gap by developing a secure and efficient EVM-Soroban interoperability data transmission oracle network and asset bridge.

By enabling seamless liquidity transfers between EVM chains and Soroban, LiquidsFi enhances capital efficiency, dApp accessibility, and overall adoption of Soroban-based assets.

Additional information:

#### Team Finance Services explanation

-   TrustSwap‚Äôs Token Generator: lowers the entry barrier for projects to launch their own token on the Stellar ecosystem, making token creation simple, secure, and instantaneous, enabling them to go to market quickly with their product or service.
    
-   Liquidity Locks: a non-custodial service designed to de-risk DeFi by eliminating common bad actor tactics, such as rug pulls, preventing projects from removing their entire liquidity. Enhances investor and community confidence with DeFi transparency tools. All liquidity token locks set up by Stellar projects will be verifiable through our public lock dashboard.
    
-   Team Token Locks: reduce risk in DeFi by eliminating common bad actor tactics, such as exit scams, preventing projects from mass-dumping their tokens. Boost investor and community confidence with transparency tools. All non-custodial team token locks set up by Stellar projects will be verifiable through our public lock dashboard.
    
-   NFT Locks: a service designed to de-risk operations by eliminating bad actor tactics. Boost investor and community confidence by securely locking NFTs in our non-custodial vault.
    
-   Vesting as a Service: Stellar projects will save time and cost with this non-custodial fully automated vesting service. Instead of triggering mass sell-offs by distributing vested tokens to all recipients at once, our smart contract gradually releases small portions into a claiming dashboard. This approach ensures a balanced and steady release of unlocked tokens, reducing sell pressure and minimizing price volatility.
    
-   Staking as a Service: Stellar projects can save time and cost with our user-friendly, instant Staking Pool service. Simply follow the wizard, set pool parameters, transfer rewards, and let the smart contract take care of the rest. This service provides an easy & quick way for Stellar projects to incentivize holders to lock their tokens, earn passive income, and reduce token circulation.
