Just prior to our brand launch, Soroban was announced as a replacement for Turrets - so we made the decision to get to market using Turrets and continue with the launch with a view to migrate to Soroban as soon as feasible. Our smart contracts control royalty payments and allow the trading of NFTs on Stellar without requiring use of Stroops as the NFT unit. The royalty system enables NFT creators and businesses to provide support for social and environmental causes when they sell or trade assets.
Spatium Wallet,SCF #13,Integration of Stellar blockchain into Spatium Wallet Builder solution,Spatium Wallet,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recKUYCRQLT6Vq3Pj,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$148000.00,$148000.00,1418885.88,4/5/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,Spatium offers an open-source Web3 Wallet Builder for businesses which allows to break barriers for mass adoption,"Spatium is a solution for businesses that would like to provide their users with the gateway to WEB3. So any business can develop a non-custodial wallet, pack it with the best features industry has: multi-party computation instead of the private key, biometric backup instead of seed phrase, blockchain agnostic signature, DApp browser and much more. Many traditional businesses coming to Web3 and crypto native projects want to step in with their own wallets to give end-users not only unique functionality they have, but also to guide them through Web3. Unfortunately, at a certain point they understand that building and developing a non-custodial wallet is not a simple task - it might take from three months to never. Even those who managed to overcome the initial release face countless support issues. That is where Wallet Builder steps ahead. Wallet Builder is a platform where businesses can create their own non-custodial wallet based on native and custom modules. Such approach allows to significantly decrease the amount of resources required by the business to design, develop, launch and support crypto wallets, and introduce new features. We are distributing our crypto wallet via B2B2C and our potential clients are both traditional and crypto-native businesses. We already have got partners with over 100k users onboarded and we have rather ambitious plans for attracting new clients. Our team is going to implement Stellar blockchain in our Wallet Builder. So the increase in demand for our solution will help the inclusion of the Stellar chain into the ecosystem of our current and future customers and subsequently their users will be able to use the Stellar blockchain advantages. Our solution implies to have flexible integration options: Box Solution (customized mobile App) or Wallet SDK. Thus, our Wallet Builder with integrated Stellar blockchain functionality can be used both for integrating into existing clients’ application or as a stand-alone application.",,,https://spatium.net/,,https://www.loom.com/share/937ca108618f456d80ae0085ddb9e062,,,,,,,Andrei Rabenok,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/spatium-capital/,https://twitter.com/spatium_news,,

Qolaq's MAP is a Web3 solution to the restrictive practices and inefficiencies of global health and life insurance, providing the underserved with mutual aid programs that enable Members to support each other in times of need. Qolaq is not an insurance company, so does not conduct underwriting, collect premiums or maintain reserves to pay claims. Qolaq provides programs and the MAP for its Members. Qolaq receives contributions from Members to operate the MAP. Qolaq's MAP follows proven, successful mutual aid models of the past and is developing a Web3 platform with Soroban to facilitate immediate claim settlement and permit Members to collectively decide on claims with full transparency, removing conflicts of interest. Full Member privacy can be achieved while delivering fair and impartial participation. The costs for administering MAP will be transparent and can be recorded on chain. MAP's decentralized approach also removes significant operating costs/commissions of typical insurers. MAP programs are designed for the underserved seeking coverage but either do not have access to traditional insurers, have been rejected due to underwriting requirements, do not understand complex insurance policy terms or cannot afford monthly premiums. Leveraging Soroban will enable automated remittance of claims upon Members' approval. Qolaq also seeks to access the existing financial rails through Stellar/Soroban to provide fiat on/off ramps for payments. Based on Stellar's commitment to financial inclusion, such collaboration will support Qolaq to reach beyond its initial markets to provide our decentralized MAP internationally.",,,qolaq.org,,https://youtu.be/n9R7IKu0RzI,,,,,,,"Barry Lee, Doory",,https://linkfly.to/qolaqfoundation,@qolaq_org,,

We are looking to build a development platform for Stellar like we see with Alchemy and Infura. Our initial focus is on providing production-ready infrastructure API endpoints for Horizon API servers and Soroban RPC nodes, as well as managed instances. We want to make sure we provide a platform that is reliable and developer-friendly. One problem that we are looking to solve is that teams may not want to run their own infrastructure, so we are available to run and manage that for them. Another problem is that other solutions may be cost prohibitive, so we want to provide an affordable option that is more accessible.",,,https://www.withobsrvr.com,https://github.com/withObsrvr/nomad-pack-web3-registry,https://www.loom.com/share/78adf7596f034e4a911d790d59f26cc9,,,,,,,Tillman Mosley,,,https://twitter.com/withobsrvr,,

Our platform issues certifications as secure, non-transferable, and verifiable Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on the Stellar network. These SBTs, managed through Soroban smart contracts, serve as unique identity tokens that showcase an individual or entity's characteristics, features, traits, and accomplishments in a visually appealing format. With its unique combination of decentralization, innovative visualization, and simple verification, Chaincerts provides unparalleled security, reliability, and transparency to the certificate management process.

Similarly, the SDF has been encouraging a potential Public Node role in Allbridge’s trust-minimized cross-chain bridge. We expect similar opportunities will only grow with the introduction of Soroban. Any funds received from SCF round 12 will be used to expand our stellar-supporting hardware, implement ongoing trustless opportunities, and seek out new partnerships and methods to provide trust-minimized services to developers using Stellar.",,,https://publicnode.org,,https://youtu.be/SVSwUdOSu-w,,,,,,,Daniel Fisher ,,,https://twitter.com/publicnode,https://discord.gg/pVR29p5NxK,

Stablecoins are key for blockchain adoption and are one of the reasons why the DeFi space has evolved so quickly. Unfortunately, current stablecoin providers across the blockchain ecosystem haven't been transparent enough, and we see more and more red flags from stablecoin issuers. But decentralized solutions like DAI and others have proven there is value in decentralized stablecoins because transparency is built into them by default. For that reason and many more, it seems reasonable to be inspired by their success and create a similar solution.

As the term ""ecosystem"" hints, we envision XycLoans not only as a protocol but as a protocol + other components, making it effectively an ecosystem. There are 4 main components in XycLoans: the smart contracts, backend functions to build a database, scale, and make the front end faster, a web app to graphically develop contracts that use flash loans without coding knowledge, and a high-quality web app for lenders to manage their liquidity.
Comet,SCF #13,Comet,Comet,Financial Protocols,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recG7Kj7ouwAFP2XY,Awarded,,Legacy Award v4.0 (90%),$150000.00,$150000.00,1425870.79,4/5/2023,Legacy v4.0 Award,Comet is a weighted AMM protocol that offers soroban projects a flexible solution set when picking liquidity venues,"Comet is a Soroban implementation of Balancer’s weighted automated market maker protocol. It utilizes an N-dimensional surface-based cost function to enable the creation of arbitrary weight, arbitrary asset count, AMM pools. So instead of being limited to the standard 50/50 seen in classic XYK AMM pools, users could deploy 2-asset pools with asset weights of 80/20 or even 4-asset pools with weights of 10/15/15/60. This increased flexibility allows AMMs to serve a much wider array of use cases for users and projects. These capabilities, and their effect on ecosystem liquidity, make weighted AMMs a natural fit for the Stellar ecosystem.
