By integrating Stellar blockchain technology and the Beans Merchant SDK ,which connects to NGNC issued by Link, Cartwey enables customers to pay securely and efficiently using cryptocurrencies like XLM, USDC, and NGNC and other currencies supported on beans, directly from their mobile devices—no checkout queues, no cash handling. Beans handles all swaps and conversions, ensuring seamless settlement for merchants in local currency.","CARTWEY ECOSYSTEM

Customer Mobile App (iOS & Android):  
Enables users to scan product barcodes, view prices, and check out using crypto (via Beans Wallet) or local fiat payment options. Designed for speed and simplicity.  
iOS: Download here  
Android: Download here

Merchant Dashboard:  
Allows store owners to manage products, view real-time transactions, and monitor sales performance. Includes support for dynamic pricing and inventory sync.

Stellar USDC Integration via Beans SDK:  
Supports crypto payments in USDC and other currencies available through Beans. Regardless of the asset used at checkout, Beans handles the on-chain conversion to NGNC and sends the equivalent to Cartwey for merchant settlement. This ensures merchants always receive payouts in NGN while giving customers global currency flexibility.

Multi-Payment Options (via Paystack):  
Accepts bank transfers, card payments, and USSD in addition to crypto — giving customers flexibility while reducing cart abandonment.

Receipt & Notification System:  
Customers get instant e-receipts after checkout. Merchants get notified of sales and inventory changes in real time.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cadQRI-HEu0VMSCS-cQ4qZYpTacSkA8N/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs,"#### Success Criteria

Retail-Specific Usability

-   Cartwey must enable small to large retail merchants (e.g., supermarkets, gadget stores, corner shops) to accept stablecoin payments effortlessly.
    
-   Beans Wallet should support all essential retail transactions, including product scan-to-pay, instant merchant settlements, and cashback/loyalty integration.
    
-   Beans Wallet should also power top-up options for customers preferring to pre-load their wallet for faster checkout.
    

Seamless Transactions & Real-Time Settlement

-   Payments must be processed in real-time, with immediate confirmation shown to both customer and merchant.
    
-   Webhooks must handle event-based updates like transaction success, refund triggers, and balance updates.
    
-   Offline QR fallback (optional) ensures basic checkout even when internet access is poor.
    

Merchant & Shopper Experience

-   The checkout process must be fast, intuitive, and mobile-first, allowing users to scan items and pay within seconds.
    
-   Merchants must receive automated receipts, transaction breakdowns, and daily summaries.
    
-   The dashboard should simplify configuration of tokens, refund preferences, and reporting access.
    

 Scalability & Future Integration

-   Beans Wallet should be deeply integrated into Cartwey's store dashboard and mobile app, ensuring that crypto payments feel native—not an addon.
    
-   The backend infrastructure must support multi-merchant onboarding, allowing hundreds of stores to operate simultaneously.
    
-   Financial reporting must clearly show crypto inflow, token conversions, and stablecoin balances for easier bookkeeping and regulatory clarity.
    

By successfully implementing this roadmap, Cartwey will become one of the first African retail payment platforms to offer smooth, decentralized self-checkout with crypto. This will:

-   Normalize USDC/NGNC as modern retail currencies.
    
-   Attract forward-thinking merchants and crypto-native consumers.
    
-   Position Cartwey as a leading gateway for real-world stablecoin adoption.",https://cartwey.com,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icZ_4FLuh-GqOq6uLzm-FP3VMER7Va4Arz1X-sYuHSM/edit?tab=t.0,https://youtu.be/yJpGKXTYQto,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Cartwey is developing a retail shopping solution that enables customers to scan and pay for products directly through their mobile devices.

Sollpay: Keyless ZK Wallet + Stellar,SCF #38,"Keyless Stellar Wallet-Buy, Send, Invest",,Applications,,Information Collection,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$118000.00,$0.00,0.0,,Build,"Builds a Stellar-integrated, keyless AA wallet using ZK-based identity to let users send crypto, access DeFi & xStock via phone/email.   Develops a Stellar-integrated keyless wallet system that leverages abstract accounts and zero-knowledge authentication to enable phone/email-based crypto transfers, on-chain stock investments, and cross-chain DeFi access, removing seed phrase risks while expanding the reach of Stellar to mobile-native users.","Sollpay will integrate Stellar into its keyless wallet infrastructure through three major upgrades that enable seamless crypto payments, programmable identity, and cross-chain investing:

1) Stellar Payment Rail Integration

We will implement native Stellar USDC support within Sollpay’s abstract account wallet. Using Stellar’s low-fee, high-speed infrastructure, users will be able to send and receive crypto assets using phone numbers or email addresses, without seed phrases or public keys. This lowers the barrier for onboarding non-crypto-native users, especially in mobile-first regions.

2) Cross-Chain Swap Access Between Stellar And Solana

Sollpay will provide opportunities to Solana’s 32M+ wallet users and 4.8M+ daily actives into the Stellar network by enabling them to seamlessly access Stellar-based assets and payment rails using a single keyless wallet. Through embedded swap bridges, Solana users will convert tokens like SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC directly within the app, enabling real-world spending, remittances, and investment on Stellar. This flow positions Stellar as a destination layer for global users coming from high-velocity DeFi environments, while abstracting away key management and wallet friction through Sollpay’s infrastructure.

3)ZK-Based Identity Abstraction with Stellar Accounts

We will extend our zero-knowledge authentication layer to support Stellar accounts, enabling users to generate secure, non-custodial wallets without manual key management. Stellar accounts will be instantiated and linked through AA+ZK logic, allowing compliant and secure identity abstraction while maintaining user privacy and custody. This bridges the gap between usability and security in the Stellar ecosystem.

By embedding Stellar deeply into Sollpay’s technical stack, we’re not just adding a chain — we’re extending Stellar’s reach into a mobile-first, identity-native, and cross-chain financial layer, unlocking new use cases like contact-based payments, Web3 investing, and frictionless staking for users around the world.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i34nv0N0h7tkohonl7yG33f4tBXi6mvrH60zCzfV_M4/edit?usp=sharing,"Quantitative Success

- User Growth: Onboard 20,000+ new users into the Stellar ecosystem through Sollpay within 12 months of mainnet launch

- Swap Volume: 1,000 users transacting with Stellar assets within six months post-launch.

- xStock Participation: Drive 1,000+ Stellar wallets engaging with synthetic stock assets issued and settled on-chain

- Seedless Onboarding: Ensure 100% of users access their wallets through keyless AA login, without seed phrases or key management

Ecosystem Impact

- User Onboarding into Stellar: Serve as a high-conversion on-ramp, bringing mobile-native and Solana DeFi users into the Stellar network

- Real-World Financial Use: Promote Stellar USDC as a tool for everyday transactions, cross-border transfers, and asset holding

- Developer & Protocol Engagement: Expand usage of Stellar-issued tokens and support anchor liquidity by simplifying access

- Wallet Layer Innovation: Establish a mobile-first, keyless wallet layer that aligns with Stellar’s vision of open, global financial access

- Interchain Positioning: Strengthen Stellar’s role in cross-chain finance by connecting liquidity and user flows from high-activity networks

Vision of Success

Sollpay aims to make Stellar a preferred destination for real-world crypto usage—powered by a frictionless, seedless wallet experience. By enabling easy access to stablecoins, investing, and transfers via phone or email login, we will unlock Stellar for a new generation of Web2 and cross-chain users.",https://www.sollpay.com/,https://github.com/Mercury-Labs-Dev/SollPay-Protocol,https://youtu.be/ve06XUd90_I?si=OSu3ph5ysWJ_nA3P,Yes,"After completing the Stellar integration, Sollpay will launch a targeted, multi-phase go-to-market strategy focused on cross-chain user acquisition, ecosystem collaboration, and mobile-native adoption:

Solana User Migration → Stellar

We will activate our existing Solana user base—spanning over 32 million wallets and 2 million daily active users—by enabling seamless access to Stellar assets such as USDC through contact-based swap flows. With Sollpay’s keyless wallet, users can convert SOL or USDT into Stellar USDC in a single tap, making Stellar a destination layer for real-world spending, stablecoin usage, and digital payments.

Cross-Chain Ecosystem Partnerships

Through integrations with leading Solana protocols (e.g. Jito for staking, Jupiter for swaps), Sollpay will offer high-value Stellar onramps to a DeFi-native audience. These features will be delivered within our user-centric wallet interface, abstracting away seed phrases and complex bridging, and accelerating Stellar exposure across cross-chain communities.

Community Activation & Brand Visibility

As a member of Solana Superteam and a portfolio company of both the Binance France Web3 Accelerator and the HEC Incubator at Station F, Sollpay will leverage its strong presence in the European Web3 ecosystem to run demo campaigns, education workshops, and user onboarding events focused on GenZ and mobile-first users entering the Stellar ecosystem.

Product-Led Growth Strategy

By combining contact-based transfers, seedless account creation, and xStock investing into a single mobile-native interface, Sollpay lowers the entry barrier to on-chain finance. This positions Stellar as a gateway to real-world payments and investing, while enabling a Web2-friendly, secure, and scalable experience from day one.","Ecosystem Partnerships & Recognition

-   Regulators access real-time dashboards that flag anomalies, ensuring higher food safety standards at lower oversight cost.
    
-   Importers gain verifiable transparency on 200+ shipments, strengthening trust in Nigerian produce.
    

4. Financial Inclusion & Ecosystem Impact

-   First-time access to digital wallets for thousands of rural farmers, with Beans-App providing seamless NGNC↔Naira conversion for non-crypto users.
    
-   Micro-loans and trade finance unlocked via Stellar smart contracts, enabling farmers and processors to fund larger shipments.
    
-   A trusted infrastructure for cross-border trade will be created, positioning Stellar as the backbone of Africa’s agri-fintech ecosystem.",https://agtrail.agrolinking.com,https://github.com/JosephFashola/agtrail-eco-trace,https://youtu.be/3XlmUlGRc_Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Our go-to-market strategy is designed to ensure both grassroots adoption by farmers and market trust from exporters and buyers, using a decentralized but coordinated rollout model.

1. Cooperative & Local Agent Onboarding  
We will deploy a network of trained local agents, modeled after our Tadamon mobilizer approach, embedded within 100+ existing farmer cooperatives and NGO programs. These agents will act as first-line support helping farmers set up Stellar wallets, capture IoT/QR-based production and harvest data, and understand NGNC payments. Local agents reduce barriers to adoption by offering hands-on technical assistance in rural areas where digital literacy and connectivity remain low.

2. Pilot-to-Scale Pipeline  
The first cohort of 50+ farmers and 5 processors will transition from pilot use into production use on mainnet. Local agents will replicate this process across Kaduna, Kano, and Oyo, expanding to 500+ farmers within 6 months post-launch. Each cooperative cluster will become a mini-hub of traceable exports, ensuring scale while keeping onboarding costs low.

3. Exporter Compliance Integration  
Exporters and processors will be integrated directly into AgTrail’s Stellar-powered traceability and certification modules. This ensures that every shipment automatically produces regulator-verified QR codes, compliant with NAFDAC, EU, and FDA FSMA standards. Exporters will also be early users of pay-per-trace flows and verification fee modules, anchoring them as paying customers from day one.

4. Regulator & Buyer Trust Building  
We will partner with NAFDAC’s digital sandbox and European agrifood consultants to validate certification token logic and cross-border workflows. Verified pilot shipments (e.g., sesame and ginger) will serve as case studies, providing confidence to buyers and regulators. These documented proofs-of-compliance will be used to secure Letters of Intent (LOIs) from importers, unlocking premium pricing opportunities for farmers.

5. Financial Access & Liquidity  
Through the Beans-App fiat bridge and partner banks, farmers will be able to instantly cash out NGNC payments to Naira, removing dependency on crypto literacy. Exporters and processors will gain access to invoice factoring and trade finance modules, ensuring liquidity for larger shipments. This financial backbone makes AgTrail not just a traceability tool, but a market-enabling infrastructure.

6. Expansion Strategy  
Once export compliance and payments are proven in Nigeria, the model will replicate regionally across West Africa through cross-border cooperatives. Local agents will remain central to scaling, ensuring adoption is community-driven, regulator-approved, and buyer-verified.","AgTrail is currently in the early growth stage, with a functional MVP deployed and active pilot programs running with mid-level farmers and processors in Nigeria.

Post-launch, a marketing initiative will be activated.",Ilia,8aba2843 (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1758117600000/e-7zeVc08n9IjrD7yaNgww/MmUDE5R5ARHWG_bQwzSExL3-INtRdfxUAFqxSsjqlAEWUp2Hg3C1mr7NwEkNfMLHi0i-kJV9-ehBo_mT5qr5fjlIaWTi3w-_ifnONSgv1221GiBHWrGsEjZd5E7VSSFGTVNroLCjf7Q6vsfwGzmuVA/Zwyst2LDfgKOyRONU4FQuTafAEeBxTYgFiQHkvceuCE),,https://x.com/CryptoRubic,,

Remittances & Payments (Already built & testnet-integrated — not part of SCF 38 funding)

Problem: Traditional remittance services in Africa cost 7–12% and take hours or days to settle, leaving refugees and unbanked without timely access to funds.  
Solution: Instant USDC transfers to Lul wallets, with options to keep funds in USDC or withdraw via cash-out agents, couriers, or mobile money. Wallet-free payouts deliver cash directly to recipients without smartphones.  
How Stellar Helps: Near-instant, low-fee settlement and transparent proof of delivery on an open ledger.  
Impact: Affordable, inclusive remittance access even for the most digitally excluded.

Note: Included for completeness — not part of SCF 38 funding request.

2. Crowdfunding

Problem: Global platforms like GoFundMe exclude many Africans, especially refugees, due to banking and policy barriers.  
Solution: Built-in Stellar-powered platform where users can launch campaigns, receive USDC globally, and withdraw in local currency. Soroban smart contracts hold funds in escrow until goals/timelines are met.  
How Stellar Helps: Enables low-cost cross-border contributions and escrow logic for secure disbursements.  
Impact: Unlocks global fundraising for excluded communities with transparency and trust.

3. Agent & Courier App

Problem: Digital wallets are less useful if users can’t easily top up or withdraw nearby without high fees.  
Solution: Lightweight app for agents/couriers to provide local cash-in/cash-out, including wallet-free deliveries, avoiding bank and mobile money margins.  
How Stellar Helps: Instant settlement between agent and user wallets with verifiable transaction records.  
Impact: Increases access and convenience, especially in refugee camps and underserved areas.

4. Virtual Cards (Planned – Integration with Rain.xyz)

Problem: Many unbanked and refugee users can’t make online purchases or pay for digital services.  
Solution: USD-denominated virtual cards linked to Lul wallets for online payments directly from USDC balances. API access to Rain is already secured.  
How Stellar Helps: Instant, low-cost top-ups from Stellar-based USDC.  
Impact: Expands digital commerce access without requiring bank accounts.

5. Multilingual Support

Problem: Large portions of our user base do not speak English, creating adoption barriers.  
Solution: Add Swahili, Luganda, Amharic, Arabic, Somali, and French to the app with a language switcher.  
How Stellar Helps: Makes the Stellar-powered platform usable across diverse remittance/refugee corridors.  
Impact: Broadens reach and trust by making the platform accessible to non-English speakers.

6. External Service Integrations

Problem: Users need familiar, local cash-in/cash-out and cross-border transfer options.  
Solution: Integrate mobile money APIs (MTN, Airtel) for local transactions and Yellow Card for USDC–fiat transfers to 20 African countries.  
How Stellar Helps: All transactions settle on Stellar for speed, low cost, and transparent tracking.  
Impact: Expands reach and adoption by connecting to trusted payment rails across Africa.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v5zhRfs_7ob1DwYOcCYRsY4OHGM1jpKi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117888080581823504664&rtpof=true&sd=true,"For our team, success will be defined by our ability to deliver high-quality, accessible financial services to people who are currently excluded from the global financial system—particularly refugees and unbanked individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa.

These communities are often unable to save, send, or receive money in secure way, let alone participate in e-commerce or access basic digital tools for economic empowerment. For us, success means removing those barriers—empowering people who have been overlooked to securely transact, save, and grow financially.

This is not just a technical mission—it’s deeply personal. All of us on the team have experienced this exclusion firsthand, and one of us still lives as a refugee. We know what it means to be locked out of financial opportunity, and our ultimate measure of success is to ensure that as many people as possible never have to face those same limitations again.",https://www.lulpay.com/,https://github.com/Zerie5,https://vimeo.com/1108903029,Yes,"Go-To-Market Plan

IRL.energy is building a global cultural rewards ecosystem where users earn points by attending events, engaging with venues, participating in games, and completing challenges. These points unlock rewards, event experiences, and digital assets. IRL bridges digital and physical worlds, making blockchain engagement seamless for non-crypto natives while offering advanced tokenized features for Web3 participants.

**Stellar Events Smart Wallet & Rewards Platform  
**To extend this system and accelerate adoption, we will integrate a Stellar-powered event-focused smart wallet and rewards platform. This platform transforms Stellar’s IRL and virtual event presence into sustained onchain engagement — driving community retention, monthly active addresses, and TVL growth, while showcasing Stellar’s smart contract capabilities.

Core Capabilities

-   Event Discovery & Access: Real-time feed of Stellar and partner events, exclusive NFT/merch drops, and participation-based rewards.
    
-   Engagement Mechanics: Onchain games, scavenger hunts, achievement badges, leaderboards, and raffles/lotteries.
    
-   Integrated Rewards: Event-specific perks, NFT/merch issuance, and USDC/$IRL redemption via Stellar rails.
    
-   Future Payments Integration: Tap-to-pay NFC merchandise and in-event USDC/$IRL transactions.
    

Front-End & Feature Development (MVP & Global Map)

-   User Dashboard & Profile with Stellar wallet integration (passkey-based onboarding).
    
-   Global Venue Map with in-person check-ins and point issuance.
    
-   Reward Center for perk redemptions and future $IRL/USDC spend mechanics.
    
-   IRL Four Square Game (online & in-person check-in challenges).
    
-   Leaderboard and achievement tracking.
    
-   Partner Dashboard for venue/creator reward issuance and payout tracking.
    
-   NFT Cultural Identity Module (opt-in) for unique event-based collectibles.
    
-   Basic Analytics Layer to track engagement, retention, and transaction flow.
    

#### Products & Services

IRL will integrate Stellar in three major product layers:

-   Points-to-Token Rewards: Users earn IRL Points via event check-ins and quests. These are redeemable for USDC or $IRL tokens issued on Stellar, enabling fast, low-cost incentives across borders.
    
-   Partner Dashboard & Wallet Tools: Venues and cultural institutions access a dashboard to distribute, track, and fund perks and rewards in Stellar-based assets.
    
-   Global Payment Rails: IRL enables ticket payments, creator payouts, and sponsor funding in Stellar-native assets, enhancing global financial access.
    

Impact: These integrations lower the cost of loyalty rewards, remove geographic limitations, and prove out a real-world consumer use case for onchain value exchange — onboarding thousands of users into the Stellar ecosystem.

Technical Infrastructure

-   Wallet: Stellar-based smart wallet architecture using MeridianPay Base Wallet and passkey authentication.
    
-   Soroban Smart Contracts: Reward logic, onchain games, raffles, and point conversions.
    
-   Low-Cost Transactions: Using Stellar’s fast settlement and built-in DEX for liquidity and swaps.

-   Sustainable Token Economy: By creating a closed-loop system of IRL Points and Stellar assets, we build a viable circular economy around cultural participation",https://www.irl.energy,https://github.com/hurley87/refraction,https://youtu.be/idQWBBxYXkk,Yes,"Go-To-Market Plan
---------------------

IRL’s go-to-market strategy leverages a proven cultural network and an expanding global footprint of events and venues. Our approach is built around real-world adoption and user testing, with Stellar-powered rewards embedded directly into cultural experiences.

-   Beta Launch in Key Cities: We will activate campaigns in New York, Toronto, Amsterdam, Berlin, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Mexico City and beyond through events, venue partners, and local creators. Attendees earn IRL Points and redeem Stellar-based rewards on-site.
    
-   Partner Onboarding: Cultural institutions, clubs, and festivals will be onboarded via direct relationships built by the Refraction network. Each partner gains access to the IRL dashboard to issue perks and manage campaigns.
    
-   Creator and Artist Incentives: Artists and performers earn token-based perks for participation and promotion, creating incentive loops for adoption. Early collaborators receive exclusive perks and NFT drops tied to IRL experiences.
    
-   Event Activations + Stellar Payments: Payment rails for artist payouts and venue redemptions will be introduced via Stellar USDC in live settings. IRL will document and promote case studies on how culture and crypto interact in practice.
    
-   IRL.energy Growth Engine: Our website and dApp (irl.energy) will promote quests, track check-ins, and highlight partners using Stellar. We will build integrations with wallets and ecosystem partners to surface IRL across cultural media.
    

All IRL activations during the build period in development are funded through our ongoing Refraction and IRL activation partnerships - no funding from the grant will be used for these purposes. 

Please note that all Footage and documentation in video are from Refraction and IRL events globally, and will continue with testing and ongoing GTM activations as per the above within the Refraction and IRL partner ecosystem, including events with the Stellar team.

After the successful build program we will then apply for the Growth program, which we are confident can scale IRL into the millions with regard to users and wallets. 

Please see activations and work to date:

https://www.refractionfestival.com/","IRL / Refraction has one of the highest traction ratings of any web3 / web2 org and upon completion have already been asked to start providing rails toward Stellar activations globally.  IRL will have potential to be the onchain culture product of the entire stellar ecosystem, both in Web3 and more importantly web2 growth, vis a vis Stellar’s aims.

Kasi Money,SCF #38,Fiat→USDC→MoneyGram cash-out in Africa,Kasi Money,Applications,,Information Collection,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$150000.00,$50000.00,0.0,9/17/2025,Build,Migrant workers send fiat from bank account and family gets cash cheaper + faster via USDC on Stellar.No crypto complexity,"Kasi Money is a digital banking platform built for gig workers, freelancers, and the two out of three South African workers who earn irregular income. We are the official banking partner for Bolt, South Africa’s largest ride-hailing platform, and already serve over 50 000 customers. Our users receive a fully featured bank account and debit card to receive income, spend, and save. We also offer short term lending and automatic investing into a money market fund, giving customers both liquidity and yield.

  
Over 40% of our customer base are migrant workers from other African countries. For this group, the most requested feature is an affordable, fast way to send money home. Currently, they must withdraw funds from their Kasi Money account, visit a separate remittance provider, and pay 5 to 10 percent in fees, with some providers taking up to two days for settlement.

This project will add instant, low-cost remittances directly from the bank account they already receive their income in.  
  
Customers will send fiat (ZAR) from their account, which is converted to USDC using a licensed South African crypto exchange. The USDC is then sent over Stellar and delivered via MoneyGram’s payout network for instant cash out in the recipient’s local currency. By integrating on-ramp, blockchain settlement, and off-ramp in one seamless flow, we eliminate multiple intermediaries, reduce costs to a fraction of current rates, and settle in minutes without exposing users to crypto complexity.  

How the new service will work:

1.  Customer selects “Global Pay” from their Kasi Money account.
    
1.  Enters recipient details and payout country.
    
1.  ZAR is converted to USDC via a licensed South African exchange.
    
1.  USDC is transferred over Stellar to a Crossmint wallet linked to the sender.
    
1.  Recipient details together with USDC are transferred to MoneyGram dedicated wallet
    
1.  MoneyGram’s Stellar-based payout network instantly makes cash available in the recipient’s local currency.
    
1.  Recipient receives an SMS with pickup instructions for their nearest MoneyGram location.  
    

In the initial phase, our Stellar integration will leverage native protocol features including:

-   Payments for fast and low-cost USDC transfers
    
-   Trustlines to manage asset custody within Crossmint wallets
    
-   Multisig and pre-authorized transactions to maintain compliance and control over wallet movements
    
-   Memo fields to embed KYC-linked transaction references  
    

These capabilities allow us to execute the full flow from ZAR → USDC → local-currency cash-out instantly, while meeting compliance requirements.  

Looking ahead (not in this project scope), we will integrate Soroban smart contracts to:

-   Implement programmable escrow logic for staged payouts or regulatory holds
    
-   Enable dynamic liquidity routing to optimize FX rates and provider selection by corridor
    

This phased approach delivers immediate value to our customers and partners using Stellar’s proven core protocol, while building toward a programmable, scalable remittance infrastructure that can expand across Africa.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQDMIRbyA0B7hf1_MGZvQ-iZ9Mi7Hqz26vI2O58kb10/edit?usp=sharing,"Success Metrics

1.  Official Stellar Partnership: as the exclusive provider of official Stellar merchandise, our platform will immediately benefit from Stellar’s global visibility, credibility, and established audience. At in-person events, we will fully integrate into Stellar’s existing merch operations, replacing the current fragmented process with a unified, blockchain-enabled system.
    
1.  Online Store Launch: the Shopify-based global store will serve as the official online destination for Stellar-branded products. The platform’s “Official Merch Provider” positioning ensures instant trust and adoption.
    
1.  Exclusive Collaborations & Limited Drops: we will work with renowned artists and designers to create unique, collectible pieces. These will generate hype, attract new audiences beyond the core Stellar community, and drive recurring engagement.
    
1.  Ecosystem Integration: we will partner with Stellar-funded projects to design, produce, and distribute their own merch lines. This creates a powerful B2B growth loop, as each project brings its own audience to the platform while benefiting from our infrastructure.
    
1.  Community Engagement: through the DAO layer, social media activations, and co-creation contests, the community will actively participate in shaping future drops and collaborations, fostering loyalty and repeat interactions.
    

In terms of monetisation, we will discuss with SDF and the community. We could take a commission on (re)sales and for specific actions being performed on the platform. Another option would be to enlist this project as a Public Good project.","While the platform is in its pre-launch phase, there is significant validation from within the Stellar ecosystem:  

-   We have been in discussion with SDF and they would support our initiative. SDF already has a supply chain setup and we would build a platform on top of it. In the end, SDF will be one project on the platform (keeping a central position of course.)
    
-   Event Demand: hundreds of merch items are distributed at every Stellar-hosted event, with attendees consistently expressing strong interest in accessing products outside of these occasions.
    
-   Ecosystem Demand: each SCF round funds a dozen of projects, many of which seek to launch branded merch but lack the resources or expertise. Our platform directly addresses this gap.
    
-   Community Feedback: informal discussions with Stellar community members and project founders reveal strong enthusiasm for a unified, NFT-enabled merch platform.
    
-   Market Gap: there is currently no centralized, scalable, or blockchain-integrated merch solution within the Stellar ecosystem, making the transition to our platform a natural next step for the community and the SDF.","1.  Shopify based store;

Create Stellar Wallets with KMS: Businesses can CREATE Stellar wallets directly in Arrel. Private keys are secured via our internal KMS, ensuring full control stays with the client. [Already deployed on mainnet after SCF#37 (Check Notion workspace - link )].
    
1.  Unified Asset & Updated Wallet Aggregation Dashboard: Businesses can connect both newly created and existing Stellar wallets, and track balances, tokenized assets, and transactions from a unified dashboard. Fully coded → To be deployed under SCF38.
    
1.  Payment Links: Merchants, PSPs, NGOs, or fintechs can create one-time or recurring payment links to receive Stellar assets like USDC or XLM. Links can be embedded in websites or apps, or shared as standalone URLs
    
1.  Compliance Monitoring (KYT)= Each transaction is KYT-eligible. Through our Chainalysis integration, users can automatically generate compliance reports. Examples available in our shared Notion workspace ( link )
    
1.  Custody Options and User Controls: Businesses can choose between using self-managed wallets or integrating a custodian via API with our partner Fireblocks. In both cases, they can enforce rules such as transaction approval workflows, limits, and time-based controls.
    

What this unlocks for our clients:

→ Create a Stellar treasury wallet instantly

→ Accept stablecoin payments or donations in USDC, EURC, while staying compliant.

→ Enforce compliance (KYT) at transaction level

→ Rebalance funds automatically in Arrel, or auto-transfer funds to 15+ CEXs

→ Slash off-ramping costs from 1–5% to a flat amount in local currency (e.g. 1 EUR per SEPA withdrawal for any amount, no extra integrations or KYC from service providers)

→ Keep treasury in stablecoins, BENJI, or FX-hedged assets

→ Automate asset swaps, rebalancing, or tactical trading — no devs required

Ecosystem Impact:

→ Brings real-world businesses, payment providers, NGOs, and fintechs into Stellar

→ Increases on-chain stablecoin flows and anchored fiat volume",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nso4pxYsiwoJdukUkukfqClqEdIXQaGjwxpgb1yQZ8/,"→ All core features implemented as described in the Products & Services section

→ Successful tests on mainnet, KYT reports, off-ramp and integrations.

Adoption:

→ ≥50 active businesses wallets (self-custody or Fireblocks-linked) by mid 2026

→ ≥ $20m of payments processed by mid 2026",https://www.arreltech.com/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SIM4684uAjwq2zBfqegS8XFQlxR9L92i_zlXu16ffKQ/edit?usp=sharing,https://youtu.be/q-IRxBjHn5Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Arrel operates out of Mauritius and South Africa, our home base and core market, with hundreds of billions of dollars in annual payment and remittance flows across neighboring countries.

This region anchors our outbound sales and business development efforts, targeting four key segments: merchants, NGOs, payment providers, and fintech platforms.

To capture this market and expand beyond it, we have defined three additional focused go-to-market streams.

Stellar Ecosystem

-   Our first users for the payment flow will naturally come from within the Stellar community →
    
-   Maintain a strong presence in Discord, SCF calls, and ecosystem events
    
-   Run live product demos during major moments like Meridian to showcase real-time payment-to-fiat flows
    
-   Approach ecosystem players with revenue-share offers → they integrate Arrel, we split fees on processed volume
    
-   Position Arrel as the go-to payment and compliance layer for any Stellar-native wallet, NGO, or fintech looking to go live instantly
    

Events & Side-Events (Web2 + Web3) for PSPs, Remittance Providers & financial institutions.

-   Actively participate in top fintech events across EMEA → sponsor, exhibit, or send BD reps to engage directly with decision-makers
    
-   Focus on high-impact events like Money20/20 (EU + US), Seamless Middle East, Africa Fintech Summit, and Abu Dhabi Finance Week
    
-   In parallel, maintain strong presence across Web3 circuits → sponsor side-events and deploy BD teams to build channel partnerships
    
-   Prioritize community-driven conferences we already attend annually: Paris Blockchain Week, EthCC, Token2049 (Dubai/Singapore) → leverage these to expand reach and drive qualified leads from crypto-native networks
    

Digital Marketing Channel

-   With product-ready onboarding and a frictionless flow, digital becomes core to our GTM → we shift toward an inbound strategy
    
-   Target online/offline merchants and e-commerce sellers directly where they already live and promote their brands and products
    

By mid 2026, our target is:

-   Land 50 additional web2/web3 businesses via current GTM
    
-   Cumulative $20M monthly processed","Arrel currently operates a B2B2B/2C model, currently serving:

– FIVE (5) hedge funds with asset managers supporting institutional flows and HNWIs

– FIVE (5) payment providers offering compliant crypto payment rails to businesses and individual clients

→ We have TEN paying clients located in South Africa, Mauritius, Hong Kong and Canada

→ We are growing our revenue 10% MoM

→ We process, on average, USD 15 MILLION in monthly volume

All flows are already fully processed in production on other blockchains, not just monitored as in the current Stellar integration. A portion of these can migrate to Stellar once the required features are delivered.

-   While SCF#26 gave our clients the ability to ADD and MONITOR Stellar wallets, it did not yet enable the critical transaction features (wallet creation, KYT integration, payment links, off-ramp execution) required for live flows.
    
-   Based on client demands, we designed SCF#38 submission to remove that bottleneck: once these features are live, a portion of our existing $15M monthly volume can migrate to Stellar immediately (especially USDT to USDC).
    

Pilot Projects

-   Payment provider preparing to migrate USDT on TRON flows to USDC on Stellar; past single transactions reached 2.4M USDT through our infra & KYT engine, representing multi-million monthly volume potential. (check KYT reports here: link ).
    
-   In partnership with VAULT FX and HumanInsights AFRICA, we launched Phase 1 of a BRICS-aligned cross-border crypto settlement system focused on agricultural and healthcare trade across key African corridors. Stellar is the proposed primary chain for treasury and settlement once the necessary infrastructure is in place ( check MOU here: link ).
    

By mid-2026, we commit to achieving:

-   Onboard 50 additional web2/web3 businesses
    
-   Process $20M monthly, including 15-20% running on Stellar as initial phase target.","Estimated Completion: October 15, 2025

By integrating with Stellar, DD will power a trust layer across the ecosystem, allowing developers to query wallet and token safety scores and display warnings or take action before transactions are executed. This infrastructure will make Stellar network safer and more resilient for new users, institutions, and for on-chain finance.

We have a number of services, but here are some of the highlights:

-   Fund Flow analysis: screen wallets, transactions, and protocols for malicious or risky fund flows, helping platforms stay compliant, fight malicious behavior, and keep users safe
    
-   Wallet and Token scoring: DD any address on chain, giving users and builders insights into financial, behavioral, and code-based risks to make better decisions
    
-   Transaction Simulation: industry-best tx simulation to catch issues before they're executed on-chain

-   Reduce scam interactions by helping users avoid risky transactions and assets, measured through partner feedback and DD score-triggered warnings.
    

Impact:  
These milestones will make the Stellar ecosystem safer for users by embedding real-time risk analysis at the point of interaction. By surfacing risk data in products used daily by developers and end-users, we directly expand financial access with confidence, especially for newer participants who might otherwise fall prey to scams.",http://dd.xyz/,https://webacy.readme.io/reference/webacy-api-overview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqleLvcy-d4,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","We will open our free tier of Stellar-specific API access to allow wallets, explorers, and DEXs in the ecosystem to easily integrate DD scores into their products.

Agnostic,SCF #38,Bringing Real-Time Analytics to Stellar,Agnostic,Infrastructure & Services,,Test Transaction,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$121000.00,$40333.33,0.0,9/17/2025,Build,Offers a real-time analytics platform to help Stellar developers access and explore on-chain data easily with SQL-powered tools,"What Agnostic Is

Agnostic is a real-time analytics platform purpose-built for blockchain data. It allows developers, analysts, and enterprises to query, visualize, and share insights on-chain—without building custom data pipelines or managing low-level infrastructure.

Agnostic is now going all-in on Stellar. We are building a dedicated indexing and analytics stack for the Stellar blockchain, providing a unified interface for accessing both core ledger data and emerging smart contract activity via Soroban.

Our mission is to make Stellar data programmable, observable, and shareable, using the full power of ClickHouse, SQL, and AI-assisted interfaces. Agnostic abstracts the raw complexity of blockchain data into intuitive analytics layers—enabling everything from simple balance lookups to cross-asset liquidity analytics or compliance dashboards

The Problem

Stellar is one of the most efficient and mature blockchain infrastructures, particularly suited for payments and stablecoins. However, visibility into Stellar’s on-chain activity remains fragmented and underutilized: - No common query language (Horizon is REST only) - No native SQL or BI integrations - Difficult to track smart contracts (Soroban) - Limited support for reproducible research

For developers and analysts accustomed to tools like Dune or Flipside on EVM, Stellar’s data tooling remains underdeveloped.

The Solution

Agnostic builds a complete data analytics stack for Stellar:

-   ch-stellar: A set of high-performance user-defined functions that enrich ClickHouse with Stellar-specific capabilities.
    
-   Open analytics tables: A set of analytics table in Apache Iceberg format produced by our ClickHouse-based ETL engine (AGT)
    
-   AGX: A data exploration UI leveraging ClickHouse that allows users to explore and query Stellar tables with SQL. AGX also empower users with an AI-powered query generation companion.
    
-   DGN: A collaborative platform for users to share and collaborate on Stellar data
    

Agnostic reduces development time and unlocks visibility for developers, liquidity providers, researchers, and institutions building on Stellar.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJcAY5WPEWMSjeq1jm9rfTRfVzvAZCTY_ogpHhZbaM/edit?tab=t.0,"Metric: Target (6 months)

My approach is to put WebSoroban directly in the hands of developers at the exact moment they feel friction with existing tools.

1. Address the Pain Point Directly

We’re targeting ex-Okashi dev users and active Soroban developers who are stuck dealing with complex CLI/SDK setups. We’ll position WebSoroban as the “open your browser and start building” alternative - removing setup entirely.

2. Meet Developers Where They Build

We plan to launch at Stellar hackathons, DevRel events and within open-source communities. We’ll work with Stellar global ambassador network to host “Code in the Browser” workshops that get developers building in under 15 minutes.

3. Build in Public

We’ll share progress updates, demos and new AI features on X, Discord and GitHub. By letting developers test features early, We’ll create feedback loops that turn early adopters into vocal advocates.

4. Showcase Success Stories

Every project built with WebSoroban will become a proof point. We’ll spotlight developers who go from idea to mainnet deployment in a single weekend, showing exactly how fast and effective the tool is.

5. Drive Network Effects

We’ll grow a library of community-built, Stellar-compliant contract templates, making it easier for the next wave of builders to get started. Every new deployed contract boosts Stellar’s network activity, transaction volume and overall mindshare.

Core Principle: We’re not chasing hype - We’re removing friction. If WebSoroban saves hours for developers, they’ll tell others. As the word spreads, both adoption and the Stellar ecosystem will grow.","-   Early Market Interest: WebSoroban has generated substantial demand ahead of launch, securing a waitlist of 450+ developers. This audience includes both established Stellar builders and cross-chain developers exploring Soroban for the first time.

Minah.io is an investment platform transforming the investment landscape for Real World Assets (RWA) in West Africa, solving the pain point of funding capital in the region thanks to blockchain efficiency.   With this submission, we want to seamleassly integrate DeFi opportunities for the general public (staking, bond's interest reinvestment, etc).","Minah.io – On-Chain Investment Platform for Africa
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Minah.io is launching a fully on-chain investment platform enabling global investors – particularly Afro optimist investors – to support Real-World Asset (RWA) projects in West Africa through secure, transparent, and tokenized investment flows.  
A first investment strategy has already been deployed and is available as a working demo.

The platform leverages the fast, low-cost, and compliance-friendly Stellar blockchain, along with its extensive coverage across Africa, to deliver an end-to-end investment experience.

Key Features to Be Developed or Enhanced
--------------------------------------------

1. Regulated Tokenized Investment Vehicles

We will issue a fully compliant security token representing a €500,000 loan pool, incorporating built-in logic to manage subscriptions, redemptions, and coupon payments.  
This token will be registered and distributed in accordance with applicable French and OHADA financial regulations.

2. Investor Access & Onboarding

Using Stellar-compatible wallets (e.g., Freighter), investors in Europe and North America will be able to connect, complete KYC via Sumsub, and invest directly in vetted projects in Togo and Ghana.

For individuals indirectly impacted by our funding—such as tenants in financed buildings or suppliers in supported agribusinesses—we will onboard them to manage their cash flow on-chain.

This will involve integrating user-friendly wallets like Vibrant or Lobstr, enabling seamless conversion between local fiat currencies and on-chain assets.

For each loan pool, we anticipate a transaction volume approximately three times the invested capital; for example, a €500,000 pool is expected to generate around €1.5M in on-chain transactions.

3. DeFi Integration for Yield Optimization

We plan to integrate staking, automated reinvestment of bond interest, and potential liquidity solutions—allowing users to maximize returns through DeFi-native strategies.

4. On-Chain Monitoring & Transparency

All key events—including loan repayments, collateral updates, and social impact indicators—will be recorded immutably on-chain.  
Investors will have access to a transparent dashboard displaying real-time KPIs and financial flows.

4 bis. On-Chain Local Integration with the Real Economy

For investments tied to OHADA economic participants, key financial transactions will also be executed on-chain.

For example, rent from the primary tenant in the first financed building will be paid directly on-chain, ensuring complete transparency from mobile money to wallet.

This model will onboard new Web3 users and generate recurring transaction volumes, as the entire payment infrastructure (e.g., rent collection systems) will be blockchain-based.

  
5. High-Impact Use of Funds

Funds will be allocated to carefully selected infrastructure, renewable energy, and agricultural value chain projects.

These sectors were chosen for their strong multiplier effect on employment, supply chain resilience, and sustainable development.

We have also identified sustainability KPIs to monitor and ensure long-term impact.",https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fuwfrzuupf16obqiwksbq/Minah-Technical-Architecture.docx?rlkey=ogkzibewxp6vtge6opk6i34xx&st=df9814io&dl=0,"By the End of Q4 2025

The system serves two primary stakeholder classes — Liquidity Providers (LPs) on the supply side and Traders/Borrowers on the demand side via an account-abstraction driven margin infrastructure directly connected to multiple derivatives and lending protocols.

A) Liquidity Providers (Supply Side)

-   Isolated Lending Pools: LPs supply assets (XLM, USDC, EURC) into protocol-isolated pools, eliminating cross-asset contagion and impermanent loss risks typical of AMM LPing.
    
-   Superior Yield Mechanics:
    
    a.  High Utilization Rates from leveraged borrowing demand (up to 10x capital amplification per trader), driving sustained borrow APRs above baseline market rates.
        
    a.  Liquidation Penalty Distribution, where penalties from leveraged position liquidations are shared directly with LPs in addition to interest income.
        
-   Capital Protection: Borrower funds remain in Vanna’s smart accounts, which operate under predefined protocol rules that control every action. All borrower interactions are processed through the risk engine, ensuring lenders’ capital is protected and lending risk remains fully contained within each isolated pool.
    

B) Traders / Borrowers (Demand Side)

-   Account Abstraction Margin Accounts: Traders open Soroban-native smart accounts capable of managing multi-venue leveraged positions.
    
-   Undercollateralized Borrowing: Deposit initial margin and borrow up to 10x additional capital. Combined margin and debt can be programmatically allocated across supported markets:
    
    -   Leveraged LP Yields: Soroswap & Aquarius AMM LP positions with borrowed capital.
        
    -   Leveraged Spot Trading: Direct execution on Soroswap and Aquarius spot markets.
        
    -   Leveraged Lending Strategies: Yield generation via Blend lending pools.
        
-   Risk Optimization Layer: Professional-grade monitoring and hedging through an integrated dashboard, allowing you to track all active positions with payoff graphs and risk parameters, while enabling delta-neutral, leverage farming, looping leverage, and custom hedging strategies.
    
-   CEX-Grade UX On-Chain: Mimics traditional proprietary trading desks’ leverage workflows, fully ported on-chain through Soroban smart accounts.
    

Protocol Architecture (Soroban)
-----------------------------------

The protocol architecture is built as a multi-layered execution and risk infrastructure with strict modular separation to optimize for security, composability, and protocol-integrated strategy automation.

1. Core Infrastructure Layer

-   Lending Pools Module: Supports XLM, USDC, EURC with isolated reserve logic and utilization-based dynamic interest rate curves.
    
-   Account Manager Module: Central transaction arbiter validating every margin operation, ensuring pre-execution health factor compliance.
    
-   Margin Account Module: Permission-gated, per-user contract instances supporting only protocol-approved leverage functions; enforces margin integrity.
    
-   Risk Engine Module: Real-time solvency computation for both overcollateralized and undercollateralized positions, integrated with liquidation automation triggers.
    
-   Interest Rate Model Module: Dynamic non-linear borrow/lend rate calculations (inspired by Sentiment Protocol), adapting to utilization changes.
    
-   Protocol Registry Module: On-chain mapping of all live controllers, adaptors, and integrated markets for deterministic protocol-level calls.
    

2. Leverage Execution Layer

-   Controllers & Adaptors: Dedicated per-protocol controllers for Soroswap, Blend, Aquarius; abstract venue-specific logic while enforcing risk & leverage constraints.
    
-   Oracle Integration: Primary integration with Stellar Oracle SEP to source standardized, time-weighted price data for supported assets. Includes contingency for custom or third-party oracle providers if SEP coverage, latency, or reliability thresholds are not met, ensuring accurate pricing and robust failover in volatile markets.
    
-   Cross-Protocol Position Management: Enables simultaneous leverage allocation across LP, spot, and lending venues within a single health factor envelope.
    

3. User Interaction & Risk Visualization Layer

-   Lending-Side Interface: Deposit, withdraw, and real-time pool utilization monitoring.
    
-   Margin-Side Interface: Create margin account, deposit collateral, borrow, repay, withdraw and dynamically reallocate leverage.
    
-   Trading-Side Interface: Customised, one-click execution for leveraged LP, leveraged spot, and leveraged lending positions.
    
-   Risk Management Dashboard: Continuous monitoring of live leveraged positions with health factor metrics, payoff curves and strategy simulation tools, all directly integrated with smart account operations
    

Engineering Scope & Execution Requirements

The Soroban deployment of Vanna demands a ground-up engineering approach due to the absence of pre-built EVM-equivalent standards and tooling. The build requires:

-   Custom Lending Pools: Isolated accounting logic with utilization-based dynamic rates for XLM, USDC, EURC.
    
-   Account Abstraction Layer: Soroban-native margin accounts with protocol-enforced leverage permissions.
    
-   Cross-Venue Leverage Modules: Controller and adaptor contracts for Soroswap, Blend, and Aquarius with integrated risk constraints.
    
-   Multi-Source Oracles: Aggregated price feeds with failover handling for on-chain solvency checks.
    
-   GraphQL-Powered Indexing: Off-chain infrastructure to feed real-time position, health factor, and Greeks analytics to the risk dashboard.
    

The execution plan includes full-cycle development — contract authoring, venue integrations, indexer and frontend implementation, stress testing under high-LTV scenarios, and multi-layer economic risk modelling — ensuring that the protocol meets the operational and economic security standards required for production deployment on Stellar.",https://best-glue-0c8.notion.site/Technical-Architecture-249846d6f559806292b8e57691c00920?source=copy_link,"The success of Vanna’s Soroban deployment will be measured through on-chain verifiable metrics directly correlated with protocol functionality, liquidity depth, and trader adoption. Each metric is tied to specific smart contract modules and will be tracked via internal analytics, public Stellar blockchain data, and real-time Dune dashboards.

-   GraphQL-Powered Indexing Infrastructure: Develop the backend data layer to index and process on-chain events from Soroban smart contracts, including lending pool utilization, borrowing positions, liquidation events, PnL changes, and market performance metrics.
    
-   Advanced Risk Dashboard (Testnet): Build a user-facing analytics interface that monitors all leverage positions, visualizes live payoff graphs, and displays margin health indicators, fed by the indexed on-chain data.
    
-   Frontend Development: Full UI for lending, borrowing, margin account creation, and trading across all integrated protocols.","Production-Ready Testnet (Months 4–5) | $50K

Objective: Consolidate multi-protocol execution into a unified trading interface, expand analytics, and complete independent Economic Risk Assessment & Validation ahead of mainnet.

Engineering Scope:

-   Unified Trading UI/UX: Cross-market execution, portfolio view, and leverage routing.
    
-   Cross-Protocol Position Management: Allocate margin across LP, spot, and lending within one health factor envelope.
    
-   Protocol Registry Module Update: Add new market adaptors and trading pairs based on testnet feedback.
    
-   Controllers & Adaptors Enhancements: Optimize execution logic for Soroswap, Aquarius, and Blend; add new strategies where possible.
    
-   Oracle SEP Enhancements: Implement redundancy, latency detection, and failover configuration, or integrate alternative oracle providers if needed.
    
-   Expanded Data Indexing: Add new datasets for trading activity breakdowns, protocol-level PnL aggregation, and liquidation cascade mapping.
    
-   Dune Dashboards (Testnet): Public dashboards for LP/TVL metrics, borrowing volumes, trading activity, liquidations, and risk factor trends.
    
-   Full Economic Risk Assessment & Parameter Tuning (3rd party):
    
    -   Scope: Comprehensive solvency modelling using live testnet telemetry, including extreme market shock simulations.
        
    -   Clarification: This is not a smart contract security audit — it focuses exclusively on solvency, parameter robustness, and market-shock resilience, which audit banks do not cover.
        
    -   Outputs: Public Economic Risk Assessment Report, calibrated final parameter set, and governance recommendations.
        
-   Performance Optimization: Stress testing under simulated high-load multi-market trading scenarios.
    
-   Community Beta Program: Structured user testing with incentives to gather feedback for final mainnet adjustments.","Mainnet Launch (Month 6) | $35K

Objective: Deploy the production-tested protocol on Stellar mainnet with transparency tooling live and risk controls implemented per assessment recommendations.

Engineering Scope:

-   Mainnet Deployment: Lending pools, margin accounts, account manager, risk engine, and partner integrations (Soroswap, Blend, Aquarius).
    
-   Implement Assessment Recommendations: Apply the final parameter set, liquidation penalties, reserve factor, interest rate curve breakpoints, and circuit-breakers.
    
-   Mainnet Dashboards: Publish periodic analytics on LP, borrower, and trader metrics segmented by protocol, market type, and leverage tier; include risk heatmaps and liquidation probability summaries.","Opinder Preet Singh, vatsal salkiya",18bc0b74 (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1758117600000/afkYslqfefiIsLZU3ey87w/FHEFoYBIEKcT5vxQd5yNNW8OcRpZkLl1CesoZmQFjHXP_KoLYqLPLwcMqHHdODyeoNpmh60rrFggKd-kcovbgBxgmgV67AnvdKjc9n_66TUQ3X3BcwjbZ5vfLSEuWK28AQkzgZWvcdAQ0VIcOeeVKA/5KCXyyzQ_8LeJamZBOqqmTGZ-VYmzknbd73kDgUt76w),https://www.linkedin.com/company/vannaprotocol,https://x.com/vannaprotocol,https://discord.gg/2GCy9YaECT,https://docsend.com/view/xsqecezanmdfuhjd
