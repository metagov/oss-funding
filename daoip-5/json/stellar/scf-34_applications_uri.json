            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Project:  \nLogistech is a trusted payment processor for cruises, hotels, hostels, and tour companies. By integrating Stellar blockchain technology, it will provide guests with a fast, secure, and cost-effective way to pay.  \n\nSubmission:  \nLogistech, integrated with the Beans Merchant SDK, allows our Merchants’ Guests to pay transactions with Lumens XLM, USDC and other top cryptocurrencies at very low fees compared to traditional payment processors.  \n\nProducts & Services:  \nLogistech is a fully integrated, modular hospitality platform designed to optimize operations for hostels, cruises, resorts and hotels. Our suite of applications enables businesses to manage guests efficiently, process payments seamlessly, and enhance the overall customer experience.  \n\nOur ecosystem includes:\n\n-   Guest Management App – Streamlines check-ins, guest tracking, and account management.  \n    \n-   Tour Management App – Handles tour bookings, itineraries, and sales .  \n    \n-   Cashless Point of Sales (POS) – Allows guests to make purchases using NFC cards or wearables, eliminating cash handling and improving transaction efficiency.  \n    \n-   Website (Beta) – Offers direct bookings, guest account access, and operational integrations.  \n    \n\n##### How Logistech Works:\n\nGuests use NFC wristbands or cards to make purchases during their stay, which are then settled at check-out via traditional payment methods. While this system is already frictionless, the integration of Stellar through Beans Wallet will further reduce transaction fees and enhance accessibility for international guests.  \n\nBy leveraging Beans Merchant SDK, we aim to:  \n\n1.  Enable QR-based check-outs, allowing guests to settle their bills using Stellar while merchants receive USDC.\n    \n1.  Reduce high transaction fees typically associated with international payments.\n    \n1.  Maintain the familiar guest experience while introducing a lower-cost, crypto-powered alternative.",
            "stellar.successCriteria": "We define our success in terms of delivering seamless Stellar-based payments to the tourism industry by integrating a robust, user-friendly Beans Wallet solution into Logistech’s ecosystem. The features we develop provide real-world usability for tour operators, guests, and hospitality businesses.\n\nOur success is measured by how effectively Beans Wallet is integrated into the daily operations of tourism businesses, ensuring that Stellar-based payments enhance efficiency, reduce friction, and provide a modern, secure payment method for travelers.\n\n1.  Industry-Specific Usability\n    \n    -   Our system must enable tour operators, hotels, and merchants in the tourism industry to accept and process Stellar-based payments effortlessly.\n        \n    -   Beans Wallet must function across various transaction types, including bookings, POS payments, and guest wallet top-ups.\n        \n1.  Reliability & Seamless Transactions\n    \n    -   Payments should be processed in real-time with automatic status updates.\n        \n    -   Webhook integrations must ensure accurate tracking of transactions, refunds, and settlements.\n        \n    -   Offline withdrawal functionality should allow continued operations even in low-connectivity environments.\n        \n1.  Merchant & Guest Experience\n    \n    -   The UI/UX must be intuitive, ensuring a frictionless experience for businesses and travelers using Beans Wallet.\n        \n    -   Automated invoicing, reporting, and payment confirmations should reduce manual workload for merchants.\n        \n1.  Scalability & Integration Readiness\n    \n    -   The solution must be fully integrated into Logistech’s POS and tour management system, making Stellar payments a native part of tourism operations.\n        \n    -   The reporting tools must provide clear financial insights for businesses managing cryptocurrency transactions.\n        \n\nBy successfully implementing these features, Logistech will pioneer Stellar payments in the tourism industry, ensuring a practical and scalable solution for global adoption.",
            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Logistech has firmly established itself as a market leader in Vietnam’s hospitality sector, demonstrating strong product-market fit through widespread adoption:  \n\n-   700k+ guests managed across hostels, hotels, and cruises.  \n    \n-   $30M+ in transactional volume processed through our POS and management systems.  \n    \n-   Seamless NFC-based payments via guest wristbands and wearables.  \n      \n    \n\nCurrently, guests settle their bills at check-out using traditional payment methods, which often come with high transaction fees, particularly for international travelers. Stellar integration via Beans Wallet will provide a low-cost, real-time, and borderless alternative, directly reducing these costs.  \n\nWhy Stellar?\n\n-   Lower Fees – Guests will experience significantly lower transaction costs compared to credit cards and bank transfers.\n    \n-   Frictionless Adoption – Since guests already use RFID wristbands for purchases, they can simply fund their Stellar wallet before check-out with minimal effort.\n    \n-   Enhanced Accessibility – Payments can be made instantly via QR code, with businesses receiving USDC for financial stability.  \n    \n\nThis first-of-its-kind integration will extend crypto-powered check-outs to the hospitality industry, making transactions more affordable, efficient, and accessible for global travelers.",
            "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "Logistech is an established hospitality technology provider that already powers hotels, hostels, and tour operators with operational software and POS systems. Our goal with Beans Wallet integration is to offer Stellar-based payments as a seamless payment alternative, leveraging our existing customer base.\n\nOur approach ensures that businesses already using Logistech's ecosystem can immediately process Stellar transactions without additional onboarding friction.\n\nMerchant & Business Adoption Strategy\n\n1.  Direct Integration for Existing Users\n    \n    -   Logistech POS and tour management systems will automatically include Beans Wallet functionality in a software update, requiring no additional setup from businesses.\n        \n    -   Existing merchants, hotels, and tour operators will be able to start accepting Stellar-based payments with their current booking and sales workflows.\n        \n    -   Our customers will gain access to lower-cost transactions while maintaining familiar payment processes.\n        \n1.  Seamless Payment Experience for Guests\n    \n    -   Guests using Logistech-powered accommodations and tours can pay directly with Beans Wallet, just like any other payment method.\n        \n    -   No changes to guest booking flows—Stellar transactions are embedded into the existing checkout and POS process.\n        \n    -   The guest wallet functionality allows direct top-ups and payments, ensuring full usability across hospitality services.\n        \n1.  Automated Reporting & Transaction Management\n    \n    -   Integrated financial reports will provide businesses with real-time insights into Stellar-based transactions.\n        \n    -   Businesses can filter transactions by payment method, enabling seamless financial tracking.\n        \n    -   Automated invoicing and reconciliation ensure smooth accounting processes for hospitality operators.\n        \n\nIndustry Positioning & Scaling\n\n-   Hospitality-Centric Focus: Unlike generic crypto payment solutions, Logistech's integration is tailor-made for tourism businesses, ensuring industry-specific functionality.\n    \n-   No Additional Hardware or Training Required: Businesses can process Stellar transactions immediately, with no additional onboarding burden.\n    \n-   Scalability Without External Marketing: Adoption is entirely organic within Logistech’s existing user base, meaning expansion happens naturally as new hospitality businesses join the platform.\n    \n\nBy embedding Stellar transactions directly into tourism industry operations, Logistech will ensure practical, scalable adoption of blockchain payments without relying on external marketing efforts.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Product\n\nLoto Punto is a kiosk for payments and payouts. It works as a gateway for 12 thousand financial services in banking, utility bills, cell phone top ups and digital wallets. Our system is integrated with Digital Identity and Open Banking services using AI, automating physical payments with high standards of security and fraud prevention.\n\nHow Loto Punto works with Stellar\n\nLoto Punto kiosks enable easy and affordable self-service transactions in local currency within seconds, providing a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to pay, send and receive money. By integrating Stellar Blockchain with Loto Punto’s micro- service-oriented architecture system, we'll offer a more convenient an inexpensive channel for cross border remittances. This is achieved by converting physical FIAT currency into stable cryptocurrency and vice versa, partnering with relevant Stellar Wallets that provide on-ramp and off-ramp services in each LATAM country. For this matter, we have already an alliance with \"Meru Wallet\", that is integrated with Moneygram.\n\nIn the scope of this current project, we'll leverage our existing capabilities, installed capacity and knowledge of cryptoassets transactions, to On-Ramp fiat to crypto in the Stellar network, enabling fund transfers to Stellar accounts of end users. This new functionality will allow end users (senders) to make cost-effective remittances by converting FIAT currency deposited at Loto Punto kiosks into crypto accounts on the Stellar Network. Recipients can redeem their stablecoin digitally or at chosen Stellar anchor physical locations.\n\nBenefits\n\nLoto Punto offers a streamlined approach to financial services. Our kiosks are installed totally free in various points of sale with loyal customers such as convenient stores, drugstores and gas stations. Unlike traditional payment networks that rely on human agents, Loto Punto operates as an automated version, resulting in 50% lower operating costs. By eliminating the need for human sales agents and fixed space leasing costs,Loto Punto efficiently serves up to 40 locations with just one employee. This not only relieves point-of-sale staff from cash management operations and customer service but also provides a clear cost advantage over competitors that require a human interface for end-user transactions\n\nIn aggregate, by integrating Stellar and its Anchors, Loto Punto will serve as a convenient one-stop shop for unbanked users in LATAM.",
            "stellar.successCriteria": "The successful installation and integration of three Loto Punto kiosks in independent local drugstores will result in key outputs, including seamless functionality of self-service remittance transactions, high customer satisfaction, and increased usage by an aproximate of 2500 venezuelan migrants. These outputs will have significant impacts, such as providing unbanked individuals with easy access to low-cost remittance services, boosting the financial inclusion of Venezuelan migrants and enhancing the overall customer experience in the drugstores. Additionally, the project will demonstrate the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Loto Punto kiosks, potentially driving further adoption and scalability in additional locations.\n\nFor Stellar Corporation, this initiative will showcase the practical application of Stellar Blockchain technology in real-world financial services, increasing brand recognition and fostering trust in its blockchain solutions. The project will also expand Stellar’s user base and transactional volume in LATAM, contributing to the broader adoption of Stellar’s ecosystem.",
            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "In terms of traction, Loto Punto has a achieved a user base, exponential growth and commercial adoption with its current portfolio of financial services. We achieved Product Market Fit with our first kiosk operating. Sales reached an average of COP $20 million per month at 40% exponential growth, acquiring 2,000 paid users by word of mouth and a waitlist of 30 businesses that want Loto Punto. Our validation confirmed that the unbanked in Latin America are willing to pay for convenient access to cash and digital money services.\n\nOn blockchain development, we secured a pilot contract with Bogotá District for a Binance-based remittance pilot (see demo at: https://youtu.be/89WppjlWJi4).  Additionally, we hold long-term contracts with transaction aggregators, partnering with Colombia's top five banks: Banco de Bogotá, Banco Popular, Banco de Occidente, Banco Davivienda, and Banco AV Villas.\n\nLoto Punto's ongoing development of the remittance service on the Stellar network includes key milestones such as:\n\n-   Validation of Stellar accounts via QR code through the Horizon API\n    \n-   Local currency to stablecoin quote conversion in real time\n    \n-   Functionality to send PAYMENTS within Stellar accounts through the Horizon API (testnet)\n    \n-   Document and face recognition with AI, using the camera peripherals of the kiosks.\n    \n\nOur company has been invested and accelerated by Techstars Payments Powered by Stellar and Moneygram. Investing in the top 1% of startups worldwide, Techstars grants unparalleled access to industry experts, mentors, and investors who can open doors to valuable opportunities. This seal of approval and credibility for Loto Punto enables us to attract top talent and partners.\n\nAdditonally, Loto Punto was featured at Shark Tank Investment show (see: https://youtu.be/mDLuFOeAD9o?si=snt-ACYWTXJX440R) and is considered as one of the most promising startups of Colombia (source: https://www.eltiempo.com/tecnosfera/novedades-tecnologia/loto-punto-loro-y-goelegido-emprendimientos-colombianos-de-51-starter-593470).\n\nLoto Punto extensive experience in developing financial technology, proven by significant traction and rapid growth, has demonstrated an exceptional ability to deliver innovative solutions that meet market needs in the public and private sector. Our track record of successful projects and partnerships, showcase our technical prowess and strong foundation. We are in a position to effectively develop and implement advanced technology for the Stellar blockchain, driving further growth of the community.",

            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Our community currency system has proven its impact through a transformative pilot in the Los Pajaritos neighborhood of Seville, running since June 2021. During this pilot, over 4,500 transactions were completed, enabling the purchase of fresh food worth $23,000 USD from local merchants, which directly supported underprivileged families and revitalized the local economy.\n\nIn recognition of this success, Comunitaria has earned prestigious accolades, including the UNICEF “Disruptive Social Impact Projects” Award, Blockchain for Humanity Winner, innovation grants from Blockis.eu, NGI Ledger, and BlockStart, European Climate Action’s “Clean Cities” Recognition, and the Spanish Government’s “Break the Poverty Circle” Award.\n\nBeyond this proof of concept, we have garnered critical endorsements and commitments that underscore our readiness for broader deployment. Endorsement letters from UNICEF and other respected organizations are available for review (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-38ZHD5ZH8d36zYf-G1j2BFFuE7JuoXx/view?usp=sharing), and an endorsement video from our strategic partner, Caritas Internationalis—a global network operating in over 162 countries—further validates our model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vps7D4T9EGLHuxjV2NZLWVsOGNd7Wcdm/view?usp=sharing). Caritas is actively engaging with us to scale the initiative, and we have initiated discussions with additional municipalities and NGOs to launch new pilot programs in San Cristóbal, Madrid, and other underprivileged neighborhoods.\n\nOur previous transaction history is publicly available for review:  \n• Comunitaria Transactions: [https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x01355CDdF44EAf901E6EaeD10b27eB1e862Cb72C  \n•](https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x01355CDdF44EAf901E6EaeD10b27eB1e862Cb72C%EF%BF%BC%E2%80%A2) Previous Transactions (Token Renamed): https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x34E11ABE8347856c0fac7547B38885a4F2BE3A32\n\nWe have discontinued the use of Fuse due to its PoS model favoring larger stakeholders and have fully migrated to Stellar—whose trusted nodes offer a fairer, more robust, and production-ready platform. In addition, we plan to integrate the Stellar Disbursement Platform to facilitate stablecoin transactions, enabling enhanced cross-border disbursements, rapid disaster response, and improved liquidity.\n\nOur work has also attracted widespread media coverage, including features on Spanish National Television (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl4BK01KVAo), the best Spanish \"social impact\" podcast (https://youtu.be/cImSV0UOgdk?si=HD-eF-CCcReUXBIM), and regional television news (news1: https://youtu.be/D_EvXo3MWDQ; news 2: https://youtu.be/_CEN2o12s3k). Furthermore, we have established robust user feedback loops—via regular discovery interviews, beta program sign-ups, and detailed transaction analytics—to continuously refine our solution as we scale.\n\nTogether, these achievements, endorsements, and external commitments provide compelling evidence of our system’s efficacy, technical readiness, and broad appeal, positioning us for rapid and sustainable deployment beyond the successful Los Pajaritos pilot.",

Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar’s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar’s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2. User and Merchant Accounts on Stellar\n\nGreepPay utilizes Stellar’s blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable transactions. Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "With the SCF Build award, we aim to develop a stablecoin-powered Point-of-Sale (POS) system that enables merchants serving African diasporans to on-ramp any African currency as stablecoins and seamlessly off-ramp in their preferred fiat currency (USD, EUR, or TRY). Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar’s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar’s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2. User and Merchant Accounts on Stellar\n\nGreepPay utilizes Stellar’s blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable transactions. Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar’s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar’s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2.

Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1.

Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar’s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar’s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2. User and Merchant Accounts on Stellar\n\nGreepPay utilizes Stellar’s blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable transactions. Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "With the SCF Build award, we aim to develop a stablecoin-powered Point-of-Sale (POS) system that enables merchants serving African diasporans to on-ramp any African currency as stablecoins and seamlessly off-ramp in their preferred fiat currency (USD, EUR, or TRY). Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay’s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar’s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar’s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar’s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2. User and Merchant Accounts on Stellar\n\nGreepPay utilizes Stellar’s blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable transactions. Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar’s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar’s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar’s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",
