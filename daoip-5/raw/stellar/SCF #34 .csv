Logistech is a trusted payment processor for cruises, hotels, hostels, and tour companies. By integrating Stellar blockchain technology, it will provide guests with a fast, secure, and cost-effective way to pay.  

Submission:  
Logistech, integrated with the Beans Merchant SDK, allows our Merchants’ Guests to pay transactions with Lumens XLM, USDC and other top cryptocurrencies at very low fees compared to traditional payment processors.  

Products & Services:  
Logistech is a fully integrated, modular hospitality platform designed to optimize operations for hostels, cruises, resorts and hotels. Our suite of applications enables businesses to manage guests efficiently, process payments seamlessly, and enhance the overall customer experience.  

Our ecosystem includes:

-   Guest Management App – Streamlines check-ins, guest tracking, and account management.  
    
-   Tour Management App – Handles tour bookings, itineraries, and sales .  
    
-   Cashless Point of Sales (POS) – Allows guests to make purchases using NFC cards or wearables, eliminating cash handling and improving transaction efficiency.  
    
-   Website (Beta) – Offers direct bookings, guest account access, and operational integrations.  
    

##### How Logistech Works:

Guests use NFC wristbands or cards to make purchases during their stay, which are then settled at check-out via traditional payment methods. While this system is already frictionless, the integration of Stellar through Beans Wallet will further reduce transaction fees and enhance accessibility for international guests.  

By leveraging Beans Merchant SDK, we aim to:  

1.  Enable QR-based check-outs, allowing guests to settle their bills using Stellar while merchants receive USDC.
    
1.  Reduce high transaction fees typically associated with international payments.
    
1.  Maintain the familiar guest experience while introducing a lower-cost, crypto-powered alternative.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BCoaaKPDfQt14GM_zqeMTNXsuoZwdD36/view?usp=drive_link,"We define our success in terms of delivering seamless Stellar-based payments to the tourism industry by integrating a robust, user-friendly Beans Wallet solution into Logistech’s ecosystem. The features we develop provide real-world usability for tour operators, guests, and hospitality businesses.

    -   The reporting tools must provide clear financial insights for businesses managing cryptocurrency transactions.
        

By successfully implementing these features, Logistech will pioneer Stellar payments in the tourism industry, ensuring a practical and scalable solution for global adoption.",https://logistechglobal.com/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdF8evAuQU,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Logistech is an established hospitality technology provider that already powers hotels, hostels, and tour operators with operational software and POS systems. Our goal with Beans Wallet integration is to offer Stellar-based payments as a seamless payment alternative, leveraging our existing customer base.

Our approach ensures that businesses already using Logistech's ecosystem can immediately process Stellar transactions without additional onboarding friction.

Merchant & Business Adoption Strategy

1.  Direct Integration for Existing Users
    
    -   Logistech POS and tour management systems will automatically include Beans Wallet functionality in a software update, requiring no additional setup from businesses.
        
    -   Existing merchants, hotels, and tour operators will be able to start accepting Stellar-based payments with their current booking and sales workflows.
        
    -   Our customers will gain access to lower-cost transactions while maintaining familiar payment processes.
        
1.  Seamless Payment Experience for Guests
    
    -   Guests using Logistech-powered accommodations and tours can pay directly with Beans Wallet, just like any other payment method.
        
    -   No changes to guest booking flows—Stellar transactions are embedded into the existing checkout and POS process.
        
    -   The guest wallet functionality allows direct top-ups and payments, ensuring full usability across hospitality services.
        
1.  Automated Reporting & Transaction Management
    
    -   Integrated financial reports will provide businesses with real-time insights into Stellar-based transactions.
        
    -   Businesses can filter transactions by payment method, enabling seamless financial tracking.
        
    -   Automated invoicing and reconciliation ensure smooth accounting processes for hospitality operators.
        

Industry Positioning & Scaling

-   Hospitality-Centric Focus: Unlike generic crypto payment solutions, Logistech's integration is tailor-made for tourism businesses, ensuring industry-specific functionality.
    
-   No Additional Hardware or Training Required: Businesses can process Stellar transactions immediately, with no additional onboarding burden.
    
-   Scalability Without External Marketing: Adoption is entirely organic within Logistech’s existing user base, meaning expansion happens naturally as new hospitality businesses join the platform.
    

By embedding Stellar transactions directly into tourism industry operations, Logistech will ensure practical, scalable adoption of blockchain payments without relying on external marketing efforts.","Logistech has firmly established itself as a market leader in Vietnam’s hospitality sector, demonstrating strong product-market fit through widespread adoption:  

-   700k+ guests managed across hostels, hotels, and cruises.  
    
-   $30M+ in transactional volume processed through our POS and management systems.  
    
-   Seamless NFC-based payments via guest wristbands and wearables.  
      
    

Currently, guests settle their bills at check-out using traditional payment methods, which often come with high transaction fees, particularly for international travelers. Stellar integration via Beans Wallet will provide a low-cost, real-time, and borderless alternative, directly reducing these costs.  

Why Stellar?

-   Lower Fees – Guests will experience significantly lower transaction costs compared to credit cards and bank transfers.
    
-   Frictionless Adoption – Since guests already use RFID wristbands for purchases, they can simply fund their Stellar wallet before check-out with minimal effort.
    
-   Enhanced Accessibility – Payments can be made instantly via QR code, with businesses receiving USDC for financial stability.  
    

This first-of-its-kind integration will extend crypto-powered check-outs to the hospitality industry, making transactions more affordable, efficient, and accessible for global travelers.","Tranche 1 - MVP: Core Beans Wallet Integration & POS Payment Flow

Loto Punto is a kiosk for payments and payouts. It works as a gateway for 12 thousand financial services in banking, utility bills, cell phone top ups and digital wallets. Our system is integrated with Digital Identity and Open Banking services using AI, automating physical payments with high standards of security and fraud prevention.

How Loto Punto works with Stellar

Loto Punto kiosks enable easy and affordable self-service transactions in local currency within seconds, providing a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to pay, send and receive money. By integrating Stellar Blockchain with Loto Punto’s micro- service-oriented architecture system, we'll offer a more convenient an inexpensive channel for cross border remittances. This is achieved by converting physical FIAT currency into stable cryptocurrency and vice versa, partnering with relevant Stellar Wallets that provide on-ramp and off-ramp services in each LATAM country. For this matter, we have already an alliance with ""Meru Wallet"", that is integrated with Moneygram.

In the scope of this current project, we'll leverage our existing capabilities, installed capacity and knowledge of cryptoassets transactions, to On-Ramp fiat to crypto in the Stellar network, enabling fund transfers to Stellar accounts of end users. This new functionality will allow end users (senders) to make cost-effective remittances by converting FIAT currency deposited at Loto Punto kiosks into crypto accounts on the Stellar Network. Recipients can redeem their stablecoin digitally or at chosen Stellar anchor physical locations.

Benefits

Loto Punto offers a streamlined approach to financial services. Our kiosks are installed totally free in various points of sale with loyal customers such as convenient stores, drugstores and gas stations. Unlike traditional payment networks that rely on human agents, Loto Punto operates as an automated version, resulting in 50% lower operating costs. By eliminating the need for human sales agents and fixed space leasing costs,Loto Punto efficiently serves up to 40 locations with just one employee. This not only relieves point-of-sale staff from cash management operations and customer service but also provides a clear cost advantage over competitors that require a human interface for end-user transactions

In aggregate, by integrating Stellar and its Anchors, Loto Punto will serve as a convenient one-stop shop for unbanked users in LATAM.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCRirz5y-8kHuuz6pSeTezdWgHEC-_0N/view?usp=sharing,"The successful installation and integration of three Loto Punto kiosks in independent local drugstores will result in key outputs, including seamless functionality of self-service remittance transactions, high customer satisfaction, and increased usage by an aproximate of 2500 venezuelan migrants. These outputs will have significant impacts, such as providing unbanked individuals with easy access to low-cost remittance services, boosting the financial inclusion of Venezuelan migrants and enhancing the overall customer experience in the drugstores. Additionally, the project will demonstrate the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Loto Punto kiosks, potentially driving further adoption and scalability in additional locations.

For Stellar Corporation, this initiative will showcase the practical application of Stellar Blockchain technology in real-world financial services, increasing brand recognition and fostering trust in its blockchain solutions. The project will also expand Stellar’s user base and transactional volume in LATAM, contributing to the broader adoption of Stellar’s ecosystem.",https://www.lotopunto.co/servicios/giros-internacionales,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1iq6N7k-FwGWK-RxhYVRBQed41810hTrBGoF8OZoSU/edit?usp=sharing,https://youtu.be/Z2M5QiIJE78,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","Go-To-Market Plan for the Remittance Service in Loto Punto Kiosks

During this pilot, over 4,500 transactions were completed, enabling the purchase of fresh food worth $23,000 USD from local merchants, which directly supported underprivileged families and revitalized the local economy.

In recognition of this success, Comunitaria has earned prestigious accolades, including the UNICEF “Disruptive Social Impact Projects” Award, Blockchain for Humanity Winner, innovation grants from Blockis.eu, NGI Ledger, and BlockStart, European Climate Action’s “Clean Cities” Recognition, and the Spanish Government’s “Break the Poverty Circle” Award.

Beyond this proof of concept, we have garnered critical endorsements and commitments that underscore our readiness for broader deployment. Endorsement letters from UNICEF and other respected organizations are available for review (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-38ZHD5ZH8d36zYf-G1j2BFFuE7JuoXx/view?usp=sharing), and an endorsement video from our strategic partner, Caritas Internationalis—a global network operating in over 162 countries—further validates our model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vps7D4T9EGLHuxjV2NZLWVsOGNd7Wcdm/view?usp=sharing). Caritas is actively engaging with us to scale the initiative, and we have initiated discussions with additional municipalities and NGOs to launch new pilot programs in San Cristóbal, Madrid, and other underprivileged neighborhoods.

Our previous transaction history is publicly available for review:  
• Comunitaria Transactions: [https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x01355CDdF44EAf901E6EaeD10b27eB1e862Cb72C

We have discontinued the use of Fuse due to its PoS model favoring larger stakeholders and have fully migrated to Stellar—whose trusted nodes offer a fairer, more robust, and production-ready platform. In addition, we plan to integrate the Stellar Disbursement Platform to facilitate stablecoin transactions, enabling enhanced cross-border disbursements, rapid disaster response, and improved liquidity.

Our work has also attracted widespread media coverage, including features on Spanish National Television (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl4BK01KVAo), the best Spanish ""social impact"" podcast (https://youtu.be/cImSV0UOgdk?si=HD-eF-CCcReUXBIM), and regional television news (news1: https://youtu.be/D_EvXo3MWDQ; news 2: https://youtu.be/_CEN2o12s3k). Furthermore, we have established robust user feedback loops—via regular discovery interviews, beta program sign-ups, and detailed transaction analytics—to continuously refine our solution as we scale.

Together, these achievements, endorsements, and external commitments provide compelling evidence of our system’s efficacy, technical readiness, and broad appeal, positioning us for rapid and sustainable deployment beyond the successful Los Pajaritos pilot.","Tranche 1 – MVP Development and Pilot Deployment

Flashback,SCF #34 ,Decentralized Multi-Cloud Storage,Flashback,Infrastructure & Services,,Awarded,0.0,Pre-Launch #0 - Awarded,$120000.00,$42350.00,179832.24,4/11/2025,Build,"The first multi-cloud platform, enabling Web3 and AI companies to manage and diversify their data storage across both centralized and decentralized cloud providers. We make it cheaper, simpler, and more flexible to store data.","Web3 and AI demand for storage is rising, yet centralized cloud storage solutions dominate the market, driving up costs in a fragmented market. DePIN solutions like Filecoin and Arweave fall short, serving primarily archival needs with slow performance and limited incentives for storage providers. This forces businesses to rely on centralized providers due to the lack of seamless integration for decentralized storage.

Flashback is the first agentic AI cloud diversification platform, enabling companies to diversify data across both centralized and decentralized cloud storage providers. It offers services such as credential account management, API orchestration, multi-cloud accessibility (AWS, GCP, Filecoin, StorJ), migration and interoperability, and AI-driven cost optimization and resource allocation.

One key layer of the platform is Flashback's own storage infrastructure network (DePIN), designed for Web3 businesses needing enhanced privacy, governance, and fast data retrieval. Built jointly with the Stellar Development Foundation, we have built a prototype leveraging Soroban smart contracts for service-level agreements (SLAs) and quality-of-service (QoS) evaluation. This prototype has shown reliable performances and has been approved by the SDF.

With support from the Stellar Community Fund, we aim to advance R&D on Stellar to develop a decentralized multi-cloud platform that integrates Flashback's DePIN and additional storage providers by developing the following features:

Feature 1: Storage Provision Management

Flashback connects storage infrastructure providers with equipment or cloud storage capacities with the platform's consumers (users and services).  
In this first feature, storage infrastructure providers can register and manage storage capacities across geographical regions, design SLAs, and monetize their infrastructure designed by the function of the smart contract and the platform. Providers from multiple cloud providers (centralized and decentralized) can register, add storage units with specific capacity, and manage their status (e.g. Available, Maintenance, Decommissioning). Stellar's built-in account and transaction systems ensure secure provider registration and operation tracking.

Feature 2: User Allocation

Users who are developers of services using the platform can allocate and manage their storage usage in their reservation space. The platform will gather information from the smart contracts, such as costs and Quality of Services of the storage infrastructure providers, the tracking of their reservation consumption, and the history. In the long term, the consumers will incentivize the storage infrastructure providers for high performance and be able to migrate easily the data and its processes across the different cloud protocols.

Feature 3: Unit Storage States

The provision from the storage infrastructure providers is segmented into unit storage. Unit storage can be reserved by one or multiple consumers. This feature of the smart contract abstracted by the platform allows storage to be tracked as unit states, including different states such as available, reserved, in-use, maintenance, and decommissioning to guarantee the storage infrastructure provider controls its operation and quality-of-services.

Feature 4: Metric System

The metric system is crucial for monitoring the performances of consumers and storage infrastructure providers. Flashback must ensure the drawbacks of existing DePin technologies, which are too slow, can be solved with the network of storage infrastructure providers in Flashback. The metric system encoded in the smart contract and abstracted by the Flashback platform will collect real-time tracking of capacity, usage, and performance metrics of the storage infrastructure providers, but also consumers to drive fast data retrieval for instance.

Feature 5: Security and Ownership Module

Flashback is a platform that must fit with the compliance rules in different countries. We implement strict validation, caller authentication, and owner-specific operations. We leverage Stellar’s robust authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and enforce contract rules to strengthen security and trust in decentralized storage management.

Feature 6: Frontend Libraries/APIs

A good service application can not exist without a good user interface. Flashback offers modular tools to interface with popular Stellar wallets and the Soroban smart contract, enabling developers to integrate Stellar blockchain interactions seamlessly into their applications. Simply, this feature enables the development for third-party applications, expands Stellar’s ecosystem reach, and enhances accessibility for developers building on the platform.

Feature 7: Engine Room Dashboard

Consumers and storage infrastructure providers can track their performance with a dashboard for statistics visualization and interaction emulation for providers and consumers on the testnet. We integrate with Stellar’s testnet to simulate blockchain interactions and provide real-time metrics for data and transaction visualization. We enable operational insights and testing capabilities for developers and stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions and a smoother transition to mainnet deployment.

By developing these features, we want to guarantee the Flashback’s DePIN service will empower businesses to have a comfortable and user-friendly granularity of decentralized storage. Leveraging Stellar’s robust smart contracts and authentication mechanisms, this service guarantees secure, compliant, and scalable operations for the modern Web3 ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to unlock unprecedented control and flexibility for developers, enabling them to drive innovation and achieve a competitive edge in a fragmented cloud market.

While the Cross-Chain Explorer integration above will display Stellar-related transactions in our full explorer for every ecosystem, allowing for cross-ecosystem awareness, this bridge explorer will be specific to Stellar only. It will include relevant cross-chain analytics such as inflows and outflows, key addresses, and volume metrics. See https://ibc.range.org/ibc/flows for reference.

The Stellar Bridge Explorer (to be hosted at stellar.range.org) will be similar to usdc.range.org, which tracks USDC transfers across Circle’s CCTP, relied on by the team at dYdX, Circle and others for their day-to-day operations.

#3: Advanced Trail Intelligence for Stellar

We will integrate Stellar into Range’s Trail platform - our leading cross-chain risk, intelligence, and investigation tool. Our platform was instrumental in multiple hack investigations this past year, supporting companies such as Circle, Solana Foundation, and Neutron.

Range Trail will track Stellar wallets’ transaction flows across chains and ecosystems. It will enable transaction flow analysis, user profiling, and cross-chain activity tracking. Teams can visualize asset movements through interactive graphs and address cluster views, making it easier to analyze user behavior, detect suspicious activity, and identify high-risk counterparties This integration streamlines risk management and compliance processes, empowering teams to monitor assets and transactions across ecosystems.

In the event of a security incident, Range Trail will enable detailed forensic investigations, tracking stolen or compromised assets in real-time across multiple ecosystems. This capability will help teams pinpoint where funds have been moved and how they are being distributed and provide critical intelligence for recovery efforts.

Integrating Stellar into Range Trail empowers ecosystem teams, security researchers, and compliance officers with a powerful toolset for risk management, asset monitoring, and real-time blockchain forensics.

It eliminates reliance on centralized randomness sources, ensuring tamper-proof and trustless randomness.

Ensuring pure randomness is critical in decentralized systems because predictable randomness leads to manipulation and exploits. A well-known issue is the last-mover attack (vector bias), where the final participant in a randomness-based event—such as a lottery or validator selection—can delay or withhold their commitment until they see a favorable outcome. This exploit allows malicious actors to influence supposedly fair processes by selectively participating only when the randomness favors them. Without a cryptographic guarantee, many existing blockchain randomness implementations remain vulnerable to such attacks, making them unsuitable for high-stakes applications like DeFi, governance, gaming, and secure voting.

Our current (tentative) approach being the VRF is, the VRF function generates randomness by taking a seed (optional, BytesN) for user-provided entropy, block metadata (BytesN) including block hash and timestamp for unpredictability, and a public identifier (String) like a user address or contract call ID to differentiate requests. The function outputs a 32-byte cryptographically generated random value along with a 64-byte verifiable proof, ensuring the randomness is tamper-proof and can be validated later.

Developers can integrate NebulaVRF in three ways:

1.  On-Chain Soroban Contract – For fully trustless and verifiable randomness, ideal for DeFi, DAO governance, and NFT trait assignment.
    
1.  Fast API Endpoint – For low-latency randomness, useful in gaming, real-time lotteries, and airdrops, with optional on-chain proof verification.
    
1.  Rust-Based SDK (Cargo Package) – For backend applications needing secure randomness without blockchain overhead, such as AI models, or Web3 marketplaces.
    

Use Cases

-   Gaming & Lotteries – Fair dice rolls, loot box rewards, randomized game mechanics.
    
-   NFTs & Metaverse – Randomized trait distribution, rarity assignment.
    
-   DeFi & Airdrops – Random token distributions, fair reward allocation.
    
-   DAO Governance – Unbiased committee selection, randomized voting mechanics.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8eMVrUC_9CpP5jtUzXRlccSgLNRw__s/view?usp=sharing,"Success for NebulaVRF is defined by its adoption within the Stellar ecosystem as a reliable, on-chain randomness provider. A successful outcome includes at least 10+ projects integrating NebulaVRF for use cases in DeFi, gaming, DAOs, and NFTs. The VRF contract will be live on Stellar Mainnet, providing trustless randomness while maintaining high uptime and low-cost execution. The API should process 1,000+ monthly requests, and the Rust SDK should be actively used in backend applications. Developer engagement will be measured through GitHub activity, contributions, and discord discussions. Long-term success includes establishing NebulaVRF as the go-to randomness solution for anyone building in Soroban or Stellar.",https://nebulavrf.vercel.app/,https://github.com/NebulaVRF,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8EPL0YPzII,Yes,"#### 1. Target Audience

-   Primary Users: Soroban dApp developers (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, gaming).
    
-   Secondary Users: Backend developers needing verifiable randomness (via API/SDK).
    

#### 2. Launch Strategy

Phase 1: Developer Beta (Testnet) – Month 1-2

-   Deploy Soroban Testnet Contract & launch NebulaVRF API.
    
-   Release Rust SDK (Cargo) for backend integration.
    
-   Conduct developer outreach via Stellar forums, twitter & Discord.  
    

Phase 2: Mainnet Release – Month 3-4

-   Deploy VRF contract on Soroban Mainnet.
    
-   Provide developer documentation + GitHub repo.
    
-   Offer bounties for early adopters.  
    

Phase 3: Adoption & Growth – Month 5+

-   Host hackathons & developer tutorials on youtube.
    
-   Secure integrations with major Soroban projects.
    
-   Promote through twitter, discord & ecosystem channels.","NebulaVRF is in the idea and technical design phase, aiming to build a native on-chain randomness beacon for Soroban. While not yet launched, most major blockchains have built-in VRF, which Stellar currently lacks. Ethereum uses Chainlink VRF, Polkadot has BABE-based randomness, and Solana integrates an oracle-assisted VRF. Without a trustless randomness source, Soroban developers must rely on off-chain randomness, centralized oracles, or block metadata, all of which introduce security risks and manipulation vectors.

Current Alternatives & Their Limitations

1.  Off-Chain Randomness – Manipulatable and unverifiable.
    
1.  External Oracles – Requires trust in third-party providers (e.g., Chainlink, not available on Soroban).
    
1.  Manual Entropy (Block Hashes, Timestamps) – Predictable and vulnerable to manipulation.
    

Why NebulaVRF is Better

1.  Fully On-Chain & Trustless – Eliminates reliance on oracles.
    
1.  Low-Cost & Efficient – No extra transaction fees like Chainlink VRF.
    
1.  Flexible Integration – Supports on-chain contract calls, API access, and an SDK for backend randomness.
    
1.  Secure & Manipulation-Resistant – Uses commit-reveal and threshold cryptography to prevent last-mover bias.
    

Our initial outreach to Stellar developers confirms demand for a VRF solution, enabling secure, verifiable randomness for DeFi, gaming, and governance applications. NebulaVRF fills this gap, unlocking new possibilities for trustless applications on Soroban.","Deliverable 1: Cryptographic Randomness Logic in Rust

Brief Description:  
The goal is to implement mathematically sound randomness that avoids predictable patterns like last-mover bias (vector bias)—a flaw where the final participant can influence randomness outcomes.

We will build a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) using threshold cryptography (BLS/Schnorr) and a commit-reveal scheme to prevent tampering. This will form the core randomness module for all NebulaVRF components

How to Measure Completion:

-   Rust-based VRF implementation with randomness proof generation.
    
-   Passes randomness tests (NIST or Chi-Square etc.).
    
-   Mathematical approach documented for transparency.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 1-2

Budget: $8000

Deliverable 2: NebulaVRF API for Fast Randomness

Brief Description:  
Some use cases, like real-time web3 gaming and loot boxes, need fast randomness over trustless & costly randomness. The API will allow dApps to fetch high-speed, cryptographically strong randomness, while providing an optional proof submission to Soroban for on-chain verification if required.

How to Measure Completion:

-   API live with /get-random endpoint.
    
-   Developers can fetch randomness & optionally verify it on-chain.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 2

Budget: $6000","Deliverable 3: Deploy Soroban VRF Contract on Testnet

Brief Description:  
For DeFi, NFTs, and DAO governance, fully on-chain randomness is required to ensure trustlessness. We will create a VRF contract where the logic will be an abstraction of NebulaVRF’s core randomness module. We’ll then deploy it on Soroban Testnet, allowing developers to invoke it for verifiable randomness. Users would have to pay gas to invoke the smart contract.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Soroban contract live on Testnet.
    
-   Developers can request randomness via on-chain invoking (via Stellar JS SDK or RPC Calls)
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 3

Budget: $6000

Deliverable 4: NebulaVRF SDK (Cargo Package)

Brief Description:  
Some applications, like backend logic in Web3 marketplaces or AI models, don’t need an on-chain dependency but still require strong randomness. We will release a Rust Cargo package that Soroban developers can integrate for local randomness generation, with again an optional proof submission feature for verification on-chain.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Cargo package published & documented.
    
-   Developers can generate randomness locally & verify it on-chain if needed.
    

Estimated Date of Completion: Month 4

Budget: $7000","Deliverable 5: Deploy Soroban VRF Contract on Mainnet + Maintainence

Brief Description:

Once tested, the VRF contract will go live on Stellar Mainnet, enabling trustless, fully decentralized randomness for all dApps. This phase also includes ongoing maintenance, ensuring high availability, security updates, and optimizations to keep the contract efficient and cost-effective for developers.

How to Measure Completion:

-   Mainnet contract deployment successful.
    
-   Developers actively using the contract in production.
    
-   Performance monitoring and bug fixes implemented as needed.
    
-   Optimizations for gas efficiency and security patches applied.

We are not targeting crypto newcomers at launch.

To reach our audience, we will leverage X Spaces, influencer collaborations, targeted threads, and active engagement on Telegram and Discord. We are already in discussions with two potential large liquidity providers. Customers will access the platform directly through Laina. Our marketing strategy focuses on attracting liquidity and engaging crypto enthusiasts to balance borrowing demand.

The platform differentiates itself through its ease of use, competitive rates, and unique features on the Stellar network, such as collateral swapping and potential passkey bridging (needs clarification). Compared to competitors like Blend on Stellar and AAVE outside of Stellar, our platform aims to offer a superior user experience.

Our launch strategy follows a ""bigbang"" mainnet release with staged testnet launches beforehand. We will track Total Value Locked (TVL), the number of loans, and revenue to assess platform traction. Post-launch, monitoring the number of unique addresses in loan pools and the lending-to-borrowing ratio will help guide optimization efforts.

Post-launch, we will focus on engaging early adopters and expanding our user base. The first 30 days will prioritize attracting initial users with special rewards, followed by efforts to bring capital from outside the blockchain at 60 days. By 90 days, the focus will shift to increasing user adoption and liquidity.

Key assumptions include the availability of free liquidity within the Stellar ecosystem and interest from Stellar enthusiasts. Risks involve potential low liquidity and regulatory changes. Technical considerations include non-upgradeable decentralized contracts.

1.  Stellar LaunchKit for Audit
    
    -   We will succesfully pass safety audits with the support of Stellar LaunchKit, giving us the possibility to move forward and launch in mainnet. The budget provided is not used for auditing services, but it’s rather reserved for the work needed to pass the audits (e.g. fixes to code and possible changes to contract logic).
        
    -   Completion will be measured by conducting pre-audit security reviews and internal testing before submitting the smart contracts for a professional third-party audit. Any issues identified during the audit will be addressed, tested, and validated to ensure they have been resolved. A final audit report will confirm that critical and high-risk vulnerabilities have been mitigated. A post-audit implementation plan will be followed to integrate necessary changes before launching on mainnet.
        
    -   Highly dependent on the swiftness of the auditing party. Goal is to be audited during the 4th month after receiving the funding.

    -   We will integrate a bridging service to Laina. Possible service would be allbridge as their API would be possible to fluently integrate to Laina, giving the user the feel of built-in bridging.
        
    -   Completion will be confirmed through successful test transactions on a testnet, verification of cross-chain asset transfers, and thorough security testing to prevent vulnerabilities in the bridging process.
        
    -   5 months after receiving the funds.
        
    -   $14,300
        
1.  Passkeys / Laina smart wallet (secp256r1)
    
    -   We develop built-in smart wallet to Laina that will allow passkeys signing inside the app. Using secp256r1 it gives the possibility in future to integrate e.g. Solana wallet behind the same passkey. However, this deliverable does not include work related to other chains.
        
    -   Completion will be assessed based on successful implementation of passkey-based signing, integration with Laina’s authentication flow, and security testing to confirm the integrity and usability of the wallet feature.

Key customer segments:  
  
1. Crypto whales on Stellar: Communications targeted at crypto whales holding XML and tokenized RWA.  
2. Crypto whales on Solana: Bridging of JSOL (LST of JPool, a liquid staking platform on Solana) and targeted communications.  
3. Asset managers and market makers on Stellar: Targeted communications.  
4. Retail customers on Stellar: Targeted communications, including via fiat.  
5. MoneyGram: Communication with the team to find out if they are interested in depositing liquidity for a short term.  
  
Potential marketing channels/tools to be considered:  
  
* Liquidity incentives: Offer short-term rewards for bootstrapping liquidity.  
* Community engagement: Host AMAs, webinars, and educational content about DeFi on Stellar, leveraging existing communities on platforms like Discord, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter).  
* Strategic partnerships: Collaborate with prominent DeFi aggregators, analytics platforms, and yield-farming communities to list and showcase the protocol, ensuring broader visibility.  
* Cross-promotion: Tap into our existing user base from other projects—such as those on Solana—and provide bridging incentives for users who bring their liquidity from other chains to Stellar.","As discussed with the Stellar team, the network has identified a strong need for a lending protocol with a looping feature to diversify and expand its DeFi ecosystem. JLending will add value for Stellar by introducing additional utilization for XLM tokens and creating new yield opportunities for liquidity providers, including the holders of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). Given that leveraged yield strategies currently secure substantial TVL on other blockchains—nearly $28B on Ethereum and about $2.5B on Solana (according to defillama.com)—it’s evident that an efficient, low-cost lending protocol could significantly benefit Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem.  
  
Our team’s extensive experience in decentralized finance makes us well-positioned to build JLending. Our most prominent projects on Solana include:  
* JPool: a liquid staking platform offering flexible staking options and a suite of powerful tools, with a TVL of ~1M SOL and a community of 30K+ users. Link: https://jpool.one/  
* Smart Validator Toolkit (SVT): an all-in-one validator cockpit that automates the processes of bootstrapping and maintaining Solana nodes. SVT is designed for users—both crypto newbies and pros—who wish to be relieved of tedious bootstrapping and maintenance when running a node on the Solana network. Link: https://svt.one/  
* Albus Protocol: a highly adaptable infrastructure for monetizable decentralized identities (DID), providing privacy and compliance tools for secure identity verification. Link: https://albus.finance/  
  
Notes:  
* In the social media fields, we have provided links to different social media accounts related to our team and products so you can have a better understanding of who we are and what we do.  
* In the Other Chains field, we have indicated ""Solana"": we can use existing bridges to bring JSOL, JPool's LST, to Stellar.","# Tranche 1 -- MVP
