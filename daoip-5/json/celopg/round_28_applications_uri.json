Scientific publishing houses and science journals have outrageously high publication fees. These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. \nPaying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: \n\u2022\tAct as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing;\n\u2022\tuse high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, \n\u2022\ttake a long time from submission to publishing;\n\u2022\tundermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society;\n\u2022\tauthors (scientists, professionals and, scholars), reviewers and most editors (also scientists) do not get paid for working in the peer-reviewing process of papers for science journals. \n\u2022\tAuthors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) have their copyright expropriated. \n\u2022\tUniversities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.\n\n\nSolution. A journal-as-a-service publications platform for collaborative creation of technical and scientific publications, leveraging web3 principles and technologies: 100% copyright to authors, different percentages of authorship (as built-in feature) and scientific assets construction (through blockchain registration). \n\n\nRoadmap and Timeline. Our plans for Version 4 focus on building a window showcase for registered projects and ideas, laying the foundation for a decentralized marketplace where researchers and startups can monetize scientific knowledge. This version will introduce a new revenue stream, with the platform earning a small fee on each register transaction while fostering transparent and open exchange (6 months). \nTo achieve these goals, the grant will be used to redesign and integrate the registration platform into the publishing platform, ensuring seamless UI and functionality (2 to 3 months). Additionally for version 4, we will scale up marketing efforts, organizing targeted events, workshops, and community activations to raise awareness and onboard new users (3 to 12 months). Through strategic collaborations, we aim to drive adoption and establish our platform as a leading force in decentralized science innovation, ultimately paving the way for a fully operational scientific marketplace in Version 5.",

By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that research findings, peer reviews, and metadata remain openly accessible and verifiable, fostering trust and reproducibility. Our platform incentivizes knowledge creators, inventors, scientists and researchers through reputation systems and NFT-minted papers. We integrate with open-source repositories like GitHub and decentralized storage solutions, allowing researchers to directly link and publish code alongside their studies for proper citation. This enables permissionless collaboration, allowing global contributors to expand, fork, and improve open-source projects without institutional gatekeeping. Additionally, we embed open-source licenses and ensure long-term data preservation through decentralized storage, protecting contributions from being lost or paywalled. By facilitating transparent and immutable publishing, we help researchers showcase and validate their work more effectively. Our approach not only supports DeSci development but also strengthens the integrity of scientific research through open peer review. Through marketing efforts and community engagement, we promote the adoption of open science principles and decentralized publishing, making scientific knowledge more accessible, verifiable, and community-driven.",

Traditional scientific platforms and networks often operate in siloed, centralized environments, limiting the potential for cross-disciplinary and international collaboration. Researchers, innovators, and educators struggle to connect, share resources, and collaborate efficiently. This lack of a unified platform for decentralized science makes it difficult to fully realize the benefits of the DeSci movement, which aims to democratize knowledge and encourage open, global scientific engagement.\n\nThe Maxi DeSci Metaverse provides a solution by offering a virtual, decentralized platform where stakeholders in the DeSci community\u2014researchers, creators, educators, and entrepreneurs\u2014can come together in an immersive, interactive environment. Powered by blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and 3D design, the platform enables secure collaboration, learning, and content sharing. This metaverse creates an interconnected ecosystem for DeSci initiatives, with portals that link various global movements, making it easy for users to collaborate, attend events, and access educational resources.

Talented young scientists often leave their home countries in search of better opportunities, leading to a loss of valuable expertise that could have been harnessed for local development. Additionally, the rise of the attention economy has made it difficult for young people to engage deeply with scientific research, as they are constantly exposed to fast-paced, surface-level content that does not encourage critical thinking or long-term academic involvement. Without a clear pathway for engagement, young researchers miss out on opportunities to contribute meaningfully to scientific progress, both locally and globally.\n\nSolution\nDeSci Youths - Dewellpunk Chapter is a platform designed to nurture and empower the next generation of citizen scientists by connecting them with Decentralized Science (DeSci) initiatives. Our approach is threefold:\n\nShowcasing DeSci Projects: We will curate and highlight various DeSci initiatives to educate students on how web3 technologies can revolutionize scientific collaboration and funding.\n\nOnboarding Space: Through interactive workshops, online resources, and mentorship programs, we will provide students with a structured way to explore and participate in DeSci.\n\nCampus Tours in African Universities: By visiting campuses and hosting talks, hackathons, and networking events, we will introduce students to DeSci and create pathways for them to engage with decentralized scientific research and funding models.\n\nOur roadmap and timeline is categorized by 4 phases and we are still on our first 2 phases namely, \nPhase 1: Research & Community Building (Months 1-9)\nPhase 2: Content Development & Awareness Campaign (Months 7-12)\nOur last phases breakout will precede later on namely,\n Phase 3: Campus Tours & Onboarding \nPhase 4: Scaling & Sustained Engagement",

Amid this governance failure, new models like Network States and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have emerged as experimental alternatives, yet their legitimacy, functionality, and scalability remain under-explored, especially in connection to scientific governance and knowledge production.\nSolution\n My project is a transdisciplinary, doctoral-level research initiative that seeks to explore and clarify whether blockchain-enabled Network States can serve as viable models of decentralized global governance. Grounded in global studies and using a decolonial lens, this project investigates how these structures\u2014enabled by smart contracts, decentralized finance, and DAO-based coordination\u2014can reshape how we govern science, identity, territory, and collective action beyond the state.\nThe research contributes to the DeSci movement by producing:\nConceptual clarity on decentralized governance models for science.\nCase study analyses of emergent Network States (e.g., GitcoinDAO, Nation3, Pangea, Praxis, Etc).\nOpen-access publication of research tiers via decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave).\nInterviews with DAO and Network State builders to identify real-world barriers and strategies.\n\n\nRoadmap & Timeline\nPhase 1: Conceptual Framework and Chapter Completion (March\u2013May 2025)\nFinalization of theoretical chapters: Polycrisis, Blockchain Governance, Network States.\nIntegration of key literature (Castells, Srinivasan, Bauwens, Biermann, De Filippi, Ostrom).\n\n\n Phase 2: Fieldwork and Data Collection (April\u2013May 2025)\nSemi-structured interviews with key figures from Draper Nation, Satoshi Island, Praxis, and Prospera.\nParticipant observation during DAO governance events (e.g., Ipe City DAO Brazil).\n\n\n Phase 3: Data Analysis and Empirical Interpretation (June\u2013August 2025)\nThematic coding of interviews.\nComparative analysis of governance mechanisms, legitimacy, scalability, and community engagement.\n\n\n Phase 4: Synthesis and Dissemination (Sept 2025\u2013March 2026)\nDrafting and peer review of final chapters.\nOpen-source publication of dissertation and research papers on-chain.\nPublic workshops or DAO-hosted governance roundtables to discuss findings.\n\n\n April 2026: Final Submission and Public Release\nSubmission of dissertation to Humboldt University and USAL.\nOn-chain documentation of final insights, milestones, and contributions.\n",

While many DeSci initiatives focus on specific infrastructure (e.g., funding, publishing, or peer review), this research investigates the governance layer that enables sustainable, legitimate, and scalable coordination across DeSci ecosystems.\nSpecifically, it contributes to DeSci\u2019s goals in the following ways:\n 1. Governance as Public Infrastructure\n By analyzing Network States and DAOs as governance primitives for science, my project helps clarify how decentralized systems can coordinate research funding, knowledge validation, and data stewardship\u2014core challenges in DeSci. This aligns with DeSci\u2019s mission to create bottom-up, community-governed models that go beyond the limitations of academia, venture science, or centralized platforms.\n2. Scientific Legitimacy in Web3 Contexts\n Drawing from the fields of global governance, political economy, and decentralized systems, the project evaluates how DAOs can produce legitimate, inclusive, and trustable mechanisms for conducting and funding science. This helps address a key concern in DeSci: how to build and scale scientific communities without centralized gatekeeping.\n3. Bridging Theory and Practice\n The research is not just theoretical\u2014it engages directly with real-world DeSci actors such as GitcoinDAO, Praxis, and Nation3, offering grounded analysis of their governance strategies. Insights are shared back with the community through open-access publications, conference presentations, and on-chain documentation, thus enriching the DeSci knowledge commons.\n 4. Education and Conceptual Innovation\n As a bi-national doctoral project rooted in Global Studies, the work introduces DeSci to broader academic and policy audiences. It brings DeSci into dialogue with global governance theory, platform cooperativism, and digital sovereignty debates\u2014supporting the educational mission of the movement to redefine science as a planetary public good.\n",

This partnership is key in ensuring that Register Maxi remains at the forefront of the DeSci movement, facilitating collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the decentralization of scientific work.\n\nOther Project Affiliations\nWe have been involved in several other initiatives that align with DeSci principles, including the development of decentralized platforms for research data sharing and decentralized education portals for upskilling scientists in emerging technologies. Our involvement in these projects further strengthens our understanding of the needs and challenges within the decentralized science ecosystem.\n\nOur work with other DeSci projects is complementary, as we are committed to helping grow the decentralized science ecosystem, providing valuable tools for researchers, and creating an environment where intellectual property is protected and accessible to all. Register Maxi\u2019s capabilities seamlessly integrate with other decentralized platforms, making it a valuable asset for broader DeSci initiatives.\n\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nWe are committed to ensuring that Register Maxi is developed with integrity, transparency, and full alignment with the principles of DeSci. At this time, there are no potential conflicts of interest that would hinder the development or operation of the project. Our sole focus is to create a platform that serves the needs of the DeSci community and fosters a decentralized and equitable future for scientific research and intellectual property management.\n\nRelevance to the DeSci Movement\nAs we look ahead, we believe that Register Maxi can play a pivotal role in supporting DeSci's mission by providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly platform for researchers and innovators worldwide. By helping users register and protect their intellectual property in a decentralized and transparent manner, we are furthering the principles of open access, collaboration, and democratization of science that are foundational to the DeSci ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, Register Maxi is not just a platform for intellectual property registration; it is a comprehensive solution that enables the growth, protection, and fair monetization of decentralized scientific work. With the support of the DeSci community and the DeSci grant program, we are confident that we can take the project to new heights and contribute meaningfully to the global movement of decentralized science.",

This crisis is multifaceted,\nrooted in a lack of crypto literacy, pervasive poverty, environmental degradation, and food\ninsecurity. It is within this context that our project seeks to intervene, aiming to weave a\ntapestry of knowledge and empowerment for rural women groups who stand at the\nintersection of these challenges.\nThe importance of addressing this issue cannot be overstated. Recent data indicates that over\n70% of rural women in developing countries are engaged in agricultural work yet remain\ndisproportionately affected by poverty. This economic vulnerability is exacerbated by a lack of\naccess to digital savings tools and financial literacy, particularly in the realm of emerging\ntechnologies such as cryptocurrency. The gap in crypto literacy not only sidelines these women\nfrom participating in modern financial ecosystems but also hinders their ability to secure their\neconomic future and contribute to the resilience of their communities.\nEnvironmental degradation further compounds these challenges. Unsustainable farming\npractices have led to soil depletion, water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity\u2014critical issues that\nthreaten food security for these communities. With agriculture being both a victim and a\ncontributor to environmental degradation, there is an urgent need for sustainable solutions\nthat can break this cycle.\nOur project targets rural women groups who are often the backbone of agricultural\nproductivity yet face systemic barriers that limit their potential. By focusing on this\npopulation, we aim to address the root causes of food insecurity and environmental\ndegradation through education on sustainable agriculturetechniques and digital financial\nliteracy. The ripple effects of empowering these women with knowledge and tools extend far\nbeyond individual gains; they have the potential to transform entire communities.\nThe stakes are high, and the need is urgent. As we stand at the crossroads of technological\nadvancement and environmental sustainability, our project offers a beacon of hope for rural\nwomen caught in the throes of poverty and food insecurity. Through our intervention, we aim\nto not only alleviate immediate hardships but also lay the groundwork for a future where\nthese women are active participants in shaping a more resilient and equitable world.\nIn conclusion, our project is not just an initiative; it's a lifeline for those who have been left\nbehind in the digital age and bear the brunt of environmental degradation. By addressing\ncrypto literacy, poverty, environmental degradation, and food insecurity in tandem, we can\nunlock a new horizon of possibilities for rural women groups, fostering an environment where\nsustainable agriculture thrives alongside economic empowerment. This is more than an\ninvestment in individuals; it's an investment in the very fabric of rural communities that form\nthe backbone of our agricultural systems\n\nOur primary goal is to empower over 5000 farmers, including the establishment of 100 women\nsaving groups, within a 24-month period. This will be achieved through comprehensive\ntraining programs focused on sustainable agriculture practices and financial literacy,\nspecifically in the realm of digital savings tools and cryptocurrency. By equipping these\nfarmers and women groups with the necessary skills and knowledge, we aim to enhance food\nsecurity, promote environmental sustainability, and foster economic empowerment within\nrural communities.\nObjectives:\nTrain at least 5000 farmers in sustainable agriculture techniques such as crop rotation,\norganic farming, and water-efficient irrigation methods to improve soil health and\nincrease crop resilience.\nEstablish 100 women saving groups that are educated in financial literacy with a focus on\ndigital savings tools and cryptocurrency, enabling them to secure their economic future.\nDevelop and distribute educational materials tailored to the local context that emphasize\nthe importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management practices.\nCreate model farms that showcase sustainable agricultural practices in action, serving as\nlearning sites for other farmers in the community.\nConduct pre-and post-season planning workshops for farmers to enhance their\nagricultural practices, increase crop yields, and improve overall farm sustainabilityConduct comprehensive survey to assess needs of\nfarmers and women saving groups Completion of survey report 1 month\nOrganize community events for knowledge\nsharing on sustainable agriculture and financial\nliteracy\nSuccessful event execution 2 months\nLaunch media campaign to raise awareness\nabout sustainable farming practices and women\nsaving groups\nMedia coverage and increased\ncommunity engagement 3 months\nReach out to rural farmers through agricultural\nextension officers for on-the-ground support\nEngagement with farmers for\nguidance on sustainable\npractices\n4 months\nEstablish partnerships with local women's groups\nfor the formation of saving groups\nFormation of at least 50 women\nsaving groups 5 months\nDevelop and distribute educational materials\ntailored to the local context\nDistribution of materials to\ntarget audience 6 months\nCreate model farms showcasing sustainable\nagricultural practices in action\nEstablishment of model farms\ndemonstrating best practices 7 months\nConduct pre-and post-season planning\nworkshops for farmers\nCompletion of workshops\nenhancing agricultural\nproductivity\n8 months\nThe timeline above outlines key activities, corresponding milestones, and their estimated\ntimelines for the project implementation. These activities are crucial in achieving our\nobjectives of empowering rural farmers and women saving groups with knowledge and tools\nfor sustainable agriculture practices, financial literacy, and environmental conservation\nefforts. By adhering tothe outlined timeline and milestones, we aim to make significant\nprogress within the first 8 months of the project. From conducting surveys to establishing\nmodel farms and conducting workshops, each activity plays a vital role in advancing our\nmission of fostering resilience and empowerment within rural communities. The timeline\nprovides a structured approach to ensure timely completion of key tasks and milestones,\nultimately leading to the successful implementation of our project goals.",

This issue\u00a0 stems from the false belief that women are just small men (aka. Bikini Medicine) and was deepened in the 1970s when women of reproductive age were systematically excluded from clinical trials.This resulted in men being used as the baseline for health research and treatments for the majority of Western Medicine.\u00a0 Such exclusion created an ongoing deficit in female-specific health data, especially outside reproductive health, where\u00a0 80% of MedTech funding is concentrated. This underfunding and lack of targeted research have left many aspects of women\u2019s health underserved. \n\nOur aim is to provide researchers with the first female-specific data pools for female-biased disorders while providing women the ability to vote on their healthcare for the first time in history through tokenizing the data. We will do this by building the first female-only data union (aka. data lake or data pool) which collects, aggregates, and monetizes anonymized women\u2019s health data while ensuring privacy through zero-knowledge compute methods.

Accessing and understanding the deep, nuanced concepts requires more than just text processing; it demands familiarity with specific experimental contexts, biological pathways, and the latest validated findings, which generic models typically lack.\n\nThe core limitation arises because standard AI is not designed to effectively interact with or interpret the wealth of structured information stored in specialized biological databases crucial to longevity research (such as GenAge, DrugAge, or genomic repositories). These databases contain vital data on genes, compounds, lifespans, and clinical trials. Without the ability to intelligently query, integrate, and reason over this structured data alongside unstructured text from research papers, AI fails to provide the comprehensive, accurate, and context-aware insights needed by researchers, citizen scientists, and enthusiasts in the field.\n\nSolution\n\nLongevity Genie directly tackles these challenges by developing advanced, open-source AI tools using techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and specialized semantic search optimized for scientific content. Our approach prioritizes connecting AI directly to reliable primary sources \u2013 both research literature and curated biological databases \u2013 ensuring the information is accurate, current, and scientifically grounded.\n\nWe are actively implementing a modular, multi-agent architecture, recognizing its significant advantages. By creating multiple specialized agents \u2013 each an expert on a specific database (like GenAge) or analytical task (like gene set analysis) \u2013 we achieve greater accuracy and efficiency for targeted inquiries. Furthermore, this modularity allows higher-level orchestrator agents to integrate findings from various specialized agents, enabling complex analyses and comprehensive summaries across diverse data sources. This structure, supported by frameworks like just-agents, offers immense flexibility for building custom workflows and integrating tools easily.\n\nAs a key part of our planned development and future strategy, we are designing and releasing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These specialized servers will act as standardized, efficient interfaces to supply structured, up-to-date context directly from various longevity databases. The importance of MCP lies in its framework-agnostic design, allowing any compatible AI agent framework (not just our own) to readily access this crucial biological data. Implementing MCP will significantly boost the analytical power and domain awareness of interconnected agents as our ecosystem evolves.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nPhase 1, Q2 2025 - Q3 2025: \nRefine prompts and refactor the code to support newly added models to achieve the level of output quality on par with proprietary models \nAdd Longevity MCP servers and promote their usage by agent systems\nRefresh scientific papers datasets, and index scientific papers with novel advanced embeddings (Jina v3)\nPhase 2 (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026) \nRefine RAG search by using several agents and reranker model working together\nCreate serializable multimodal agents to enhance RAG results with textual transcription of scientific papers figures.\nBring up the telegram bot as an alternative interface.",
                            "how_does_your_project_support_the_mission_or_goals_of_desci": "Longevity Genie aligns strongly with several core principles and goals of the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement:\nOpenness and Accessibility: At its heart, Longevity Genie is committed to being open-source. Our core frameworks (just-agents, just-semantic-search), specialized agents, and associated datasets are publicly available (e.g., via GitHub and Hugging Face). This directly supports the DeSci goal of removing barriers and paywalls, making advanced scientific tools and data freely accessible to anyone, anywhere.\n\n\nDemocratization of Science: A primary objective is to make complex scientific fields like aging biology understandable and usable for a broader audience, including citizen scientists, tech enthusiasts, and amateur researchers. By providing tools that simplify access to and interpretation of sophisticated research and databases, we empower individuals outside traditional academic institutions to participate in learning, exploration, and potentially even discovery, aligning perfectly with DeSci's aim to widen participation.\n\n\nTransparency and Verifiability: Our emphasis on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and directly querying high-quality research papers and biological databases enhances transparency. Instead of opaque outputs, our tools aim to provide insights grounded in specific, identifiable sources. This focus on source data aligns with the DeSci principle of making scientific claims more verifiable and processes more transparent.\n\n\nInteroperability and Collaboration: The development of a modular, multi-agent architecture and especially the framework-agnostic Model Context Protocol (MCP) promotes interoperability. By creating reusable components and standardized ways for AI agents to access specialized scientific context, we facilitate collaboration. Other researchers or DeSci projects can potentially integrate our tools or adopt MCP, fostering a more interconnected and collaborative scientific ecosystem, rather than building isolated silos.",

The absence of transparent and reliable incentives for sharing notes results in gridlocked collaboration and unnecessary duplication. On the other hand, the absence of high-quality, ethically sourced, human-annotated datasets impedes the development of reliable, domain-specific language models for the legal field. Current AI models often rely on unethically sourced data (or noisy and synthetic data parsed from documents), leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations, making them unsuitable for legal applications. There is an urgent need for a system that recognizes and rewards the semantic labor of legal researchers while providing high-quality datasets for AI training, evaluation and benchmarking. \n\n*Solution*: Hyvmind offers an elegant solution to this problem by creating a reward channel which turns siloed legal annotations into community-owned vector databases.  \n\n*Roadmap*: Presently, the project is in the community development phase. The immediate goal is to solidify institutional partnerships (with civil society organisations, law colleges, other legal-tech projects) by positioning Hyvmind as a tamper-proof and community-owned semantic data layer for legal research.   \n\nThe concrete goals over the next year are as follows: \n- July 2025: launch a 'digital internship pilot' with partner organisations \n- Aug 2025: build an initial cohort of law students (20-50) around a particular working group (say 'Indian banking law) through blockchain-based rewards (e.g. Push Points) and/or poaps\n- Oct 2025: conduct at least 3 workshops and seminars to onboard fresh cohorts and deepen institutional partnerships\n- Nov 2025: make datasets available through public repos for wider consultation and use; another round of internships and onboarding \n- Dec 2025: launch beta version with a minimal frontend and user profiles (with rewards, reputation points and annotation marketplace)\n- Feb 2026:  feedback, review, finalisation of tokenomics\n - May 2026: launch of v1 app for broader public use",

[see the use of 'inter annotator agreements' in the whitepaper for details]\n- *Progressive Decentralisation through subDAOs*: each location will begin with small working groups which will be progressively decentralised through subDAOs.

First, we showcased a figure on a poster at ARDD (Aging Research and Drug Development), a major aging conference in Copenhagen ([agingpharma.org](https://agingpharma.org/)). Next, we gave a talk at Zelar City in Berlin ([zelar.city](https://www.zelar.city/)), pitching GlucoseDAO and the perks of glucose tracking. Both events doubled as networking hubs to snag supporters.  \nAt Zelar, we also started a trial with 7 non-diabetic volunteers who funded their own CGM sensors to monitor blood sugar swings. We\u2019re still crunching the data, alongside smartwatch metrics they shared. It\u2019s a small batch, but it\u2019s live testing in action.\n\n**Proof of Work:**  \nCheck the talk: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=uerUE6OOgPI)\n\n---\n\n## Creating the Open-Source Dataset and Codebase\n\nWe promised open-source data, so we started with my personal CGM dataset, cleaned it up, and shipped it. Here\u2019s what\u2019s live:  \n- **Demo App**: Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces at [GlucoseDAO Demo App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GlucoseDao/glucosedao) \u2014 first peek at the GlucoseDAO app.\n- **Dataset**: Processed and open at [Glucose Processed Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Livia-Zaharia/glucose_processed) \u2014 powers the model and the ARDD 2024 figure.\n- **Model**: Gluformer model at [Gluformer Model](https://huggingface.co/Livia-Zaharia/gluformer_models) \u2014 drives the app\u2019s first version and the ARDD figure.\n- **Code**: All repositories are at the [Github organization](https://github.com/GlucoseDAO) for anyone who wants to dig in.\n\n**Proof of Work:**  \nAll hosted here: [Hugging Face - GlucoseDAO](https://huggingface.co/GlucoseDao)\n\n---\n\n## Scientific Advisory Board and Collaborations\n\nWe\u2019ve secured a robust scientific advisory board and established key collaborations to advance this project.\n\n### Scientific Advisory Board:\n- **Irina Gaynanova** (University of Michigan, Biostatistics)\n- **Prof. Georg Fullen** (Rostock University)\n- **Renat Sergazinov** (GlucoBench author)\n- **Virgil Ilian** (AI advisor)\n\nThe first two have authored widely recognized resources, including:\n- [Awesome-CGM](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM): A comprehensive repository of all publicly available continuous glucose monitoring datasets.\n- [GlucoBench](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench): A leading benchmarking framework for glucose prediction models, published as a peer-reviewed paper and available as open-source code.\n- [Gluformer](https://github.com/mrsergazinov/gluformer): A state-of-the-art transformer model for glucose forecasting, also published in a peer-reviewed paper and implemented in our work.\n\n### Collaborations:\nWe\u2019re working with the open-source ecosystem at [Longevity Genie](https://longevity-genie.info/), integrating their libraries to streamline development.\n\n---\n\n## Chatbot Development\n\nWe\u2019re developing a chatbot to enhance user access to glucose-related information and promote GlucoseDAO\u2019s mission. Key features include:\n- **Project Inquiries**: Users can ask about GlucoseDAO directly, eliminating the need to scout websites.\n- **Semantic Search**: Extracts insights from indexed scientific papers on glucose management, addressing common user questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest research?\u201d or \u201cHow does Gluformer model work?\u201d\n- **General Q&A**: Answers questions on diabetes, glucose management, and its impacts.\n\n### What Sets It Apart:\nUnlike standard LLMs with generic responses, this chatbot taps into niche, unindexed, or highly specific data, simplifying access to cutting-edge information. For users, it streamlines research; for our team, it aligns with our open-source ethos, spreading knowledge while advancing our cause.\n\n### Development Details:\n- Fully open-sourced at [GitHub - Just-Chat](https://github.com/GlucoseDAO/just-chat), built using the Just-Chat library.\n- We\u2019re currently in the critical testing phase, refining functionality, adding additional papers, tuning prompts, and ensuring stability to prevent crashes.\n\n**Proof of work:**  \n[GlucoseDAO Website](https://glucosedao.org/)\n\n---\n\n# MILESTONES\n\n### Sugar-sugar Prediction Game  \n**Apr 4, 2025 - Jun 30, 2025**  \nDevelopment of a glucose prediction game. Why? Because, at least for the moment, no one knows what is the gold standard in glucose prediction. We know how accurate a model is statistically, however, there is no reference for actual use. How good is a prediction model in comparison to a human, asked to estimate how glucose will go in the next hour? Because that is what we have been doing as diabetics for all our lives. And because we have to set a standard.  \nHow would we know we are doing something that actually helps them? What exactly is it though?  \nIt will be a simple online game \u2014 users are given the graph of 8 hours before and asked to predict what will happen next by drawing the curve for 1 hour. Obviously, the graph they receive will be an extract from a continuous series from my data. We think it will be easy to play and will engage the users, also giving us information and spreading the news about the study. The timeline is longer because it is only a very rough sketch as can be seen on the provided visuals.\n\n---\n\n### Gathering a Community  \n**Mar 24, 2025 - Sep 1, 2025**  \nWe started with this idea, and this is a persistent concept. We hope that more people, especially those who need glucose prediction, will hear about us and spread the word, helping those in need. Of course, we also aim to inform people who aren\u2019t directly involved (like the non-diabetic community) about the importance of tracking their glucose.  \nHowever, this is only milestone 3 because, to reach out, we need things that people will engage with, such as the chatbot and the game. It would be nice to claim everything will be just solved, but we have to take it step by step. Therefore, I will leave the end date as far away since community formation is an ongoing process.\n\n---\n\n### Glucose Prediction - First Version  \n**Apr 2, 2025 - Dec 4, 2025**  \nFor those wondering why this is the least priority: it is because we need to solve all the preceding tasks before we can continue. We want to develop a glucose prediction app for 1 hour into the future. It will allow users to upload CSV files from their CGM and gather a rough sketch of what could happen in the future. However, for that, we need to:\n- Find out the types of data from commercially available Continuous Glucose Monitors.\n- Gather data to train and test models (we still have few participants).\n- For prediction to be accurate to a person, we need to determine the best way to train that model and the minimum amount of data needed.\n- Study how heart rate, sleep, activities, and other factors influence it.\n- Actually implement the software.\n- Spread the word about it.\n- And many other obstacles we still don\u2019t know.\n\nAs such, we plan to have the first sample for the general public by December. The timing is due to the amount of work needed, but also to the back processes involved, such as promoting, networking, and all the previous milestones, which are currently handled by the same team of people.\n",

That\u2019s because popular services like 23andMe and MyHeritage look at only about 0.03% of your DNA. While they do highlight interesting genetic markers, it\u2019s just a tiny slice of the picture. With sequencing costs dropping fast, we saw WGS and WES as a way better option for anyone who wants real insight from their DNA, definitely worth the price difference.\nAt the time, we offered some basic support for 23andMe files through OakVar, but it wasn\u2019t maintained\u2014mainly because many of the markers used in our longevity reports weren\u2019t even included in 23andMe data. We didn\u2019t ignore these on purpose; it just didn\u2019t seem worth focusing on such a limited format.\nBut then, something changed.\n23andMe filed for bankruptcy. Millions of people who had paid to explore their DNA were left without support, feeling abandoned and unsure what to do with their data. Many reached out to platforms like ours, hoping to salvage some value from the files they still had.\nThat moment made us rethink things.\nYes, full genome sequencing is still the better option. But now, helping people make use of their old 23andMe files is not just a feature\u2014it\u2019s a mission. We want to rebuild trust in personal genomics. We want to show people that their data isn\u2019t useless. And maybe, if we can give them something meaningful now, they\u2019ll be open to proper sequencing in the future.\nSo in this round, we\u2019re putting real effort into improving how we support 23andMe users: better annotations, smoother uploads, and more actionable insights\u2014even with limited data.\nThis is not about cutting-edge tools at this point - this is about making personal genomics accessible, transparent, and future-ready, because everyone deserves to learn something real about their genes.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddec Our Solution\nWe are upgrading Just-DNA-Seq to fully support and re-annotate 23andMe files, giving them new life.\nWhile we\u2019ve always focused on full genome data for deeper insights, we\u2019re now building a dedicated 23andMe track in our platform. This includes:\n\u2705 Improved SNP Coverage: We\u2019re curating a list of longevity-related genetic variants that match the most common versions of 23andMe arrays.\n\u2705 Rescue Mode for old Tools: We\u2019re bringing back and upgrading our OakVar-based 23andMe parser, making it easier to upload and analyze old files.\n\u2705 Longevity-Focused Reports: Even with limited data, users will get simplified, actionable reports about aging-related risks, protective variants, and potential longevity drugs.\n\u2705 \"Genetics Genie\" Chat Assistant: Our AI-powered assistant will answer questions about users' results in plain language\u2014no genetics degree required.\n\u2705 Bridge to Full Sequencing: For those who want more, our reports will highlight what's missing and offer guidance for upgrading to full genome analysis in the future.\nIn short, we\u2019re giving millions of \u201cstranded\u201d genetic data files a second chance\u2014while keeping our focus on science, transparency, and personal health empowerment. What isn\u2019t changing is that all analysis happens transparently and locally\u2014no hidden algorithms, no data selling. Just science you can understand and control.\nRoadmap\nMonth 1\nRebuild basic support for 23andMe data files\nRehaul our report layout to account for 23andMe data properly: no more empty sections.\nStart community outreach to better understand user needs\nMonth 2\u20133\nUpdate the variant annotations for 23andMe data using the latest scientific papers\nHighlight key SNPs related to longevity and health risks\nMake reports clearer and more accessible for interpretation by non-experts\nPropose actionables, where applicable\nImplement the features users requested.\n\n\nMonth 4\u20136\nTest with real user data and gather feedback\nPolish the interface and reporting format\nShare open-source updates and basic educational materials\n\n\nIf funding allows, we\u2019ll go further\u2014we\u2019re considering adding imputation that wasn\u2019t necessary for WGS data to hint people with what variants they might as well have, based on correlations, to encourage them to validate those by considering full genome sequencing.\n",
