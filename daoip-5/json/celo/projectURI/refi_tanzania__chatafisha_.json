These NFTs will serve as tangible assets containing relevant metadata, capturing the essence of eco-conscious contributions and enabling individuals and organizations to not only offset their carbon footprint effectively but also transparently participate in sustainability.\n\nDoc for deploying on Celo: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcQAkiAyajQbjpIndRYYcyV5Ax0mTKYnFQRdpvR2wdE/edit\n\nIRL events sponsored by Celo, going over ReFi, Celo & EBF Framework: https://x.com/ReFiTanzania/status/1731617463542915283\n\nCelo Safe: celo:0xD6801262C2e51629D14E94c7C58eCB97f5512aea",
