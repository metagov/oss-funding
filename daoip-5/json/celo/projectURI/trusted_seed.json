    "description": "Trusted Seed plans to enhance the Celo ecosystem by onboarding more regenerative actors through our mentorship-driven quests. Our roadmap for integrating with Celo is strategically focused on exploring and fostering climate solutions that can be aligned with Celo's blockchain capabilities through collaborative efforts:\n\n**Mentorship-Driven Quests for Ecosystem Integration:** Our initiative aims to bring token engineers and climate activists together to explore potential climate solutions that could be integrated into the Celo blockchain. This collaboration will help us understand how Celo\u2019s features can be utilized to enhance our regenerative practices and support broader environmental goals.\n\n**Exploration of Celo's Tools and dApps:** In alignment with Celo's initiatives to drive meaningful impact on climate goals, we plan to investigate how our token engineering x climate solutions quests can incorporate Celo's tools and dApps. This exploration will include identifying projects and mechanisms within the Celo ecosystem that support sustainable development and regenerative practices.\n\n**Engagement and Support within the Celo Community:** We will actively engage with the Celo community to gain insights and foster partnerships. Our involvement will include participating in Celo-focused environmental initiatives, workshops, and discussions that align with our mission to promote sustainability through blockchain technology.\n\nPlease visit our website to learn more about our quests program: https://trustedseed.org/participate/trusted-seed-quests",
