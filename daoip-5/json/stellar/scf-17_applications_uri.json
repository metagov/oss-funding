            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Why build a real-world asset tokenization platform and an associated lending protocol\n\nDAO treasuries, crypto funds, crypto native startups, and Crypto OTC desks sit on large amounts of stablecoins and other crypto assets. The DeFi TVL crashed after Q2 2022, so most crypto native assets are not participating in the DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, real-world assets such as Treasury bills and Agency-backed MBS in the US have become productive due to the rising inflation and central banks who have responded by raising rates. This has increased the rate of high-quality fixed-income assets such as US treasuries and RMBS securities. The prominence of real-world fixed-income assets is here to stay as the era of quantitative easing and free money is ending. This means that the DeFi native assets would remain uncompetitive with the real-world assets unless the inflation rates in the real economy go down significantly, which is an unlikely scenario based on historical patterns.\n\nWhat are the products\n\nExcellar will create two products on Sorobon, Excellar Mint, which will be used for asset tokenization, and Excellar Repo (xRepo protocol), which will be a repo-like lending protocol. Excellar Mint will tokenize public and private funds holding real-world assets. Note that the tokenization platform will be hosted at http://excellar.finance. Excellar Repo will allow token holders to borrow stables against those tokens unlocking liquidity for the short term if needed. Note that the lenders of stables on the Excellar repo lending protocol would differ from the borrowers due to their different liquidity, duration, and risk tolerance profile. Note that the tokenization platform will be hosted at http://xrepo.finance. Further, crypto holders can borrow stables against their crypto from DeFi protocols such as AAVE and then use those stables to mint the tokens and earn higher net rates on their crypto as the rates on real-world assets will be higher than those in DeFi. This will also push up DeFi rates.\n\nExcellar Short-Term US Government Treasury Fund (XUSG)\n\nFund Holdings: Our first tokenized fund (XUSG) would be a Short-term US Government Treasury Fund holding iShares Short-Term Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: SHV) and cash. The ETF documentation is available here https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239466/ishares-short-treasury-bond-etf. Transparency: The fund administrator is an independent service provider who does an independent valuation of the fund and publishes a Net Asset Value (NAV) at a frequency specified in the fund prospectus. The administrator also publishes reports of the asset holdings of the fund. This fund is a typical Regulation D private fund offering in TradFi, where investors receive a prospectus, limited partnership agreement, and a subscription document. Together these documents detail the operations of the fund, the assets holdings, and details of the service providers, such as the fund attorney, administrator, and auditor. Please note that we will tokenize more funds in the future, each with a clear specification of the fund asset holdings in its prospectus. Full documentation on the tokenized fund and the repo-lending protocol is available here.\n\nDocuments for Excellar Finance Tokenization Platform: https://scife-stella-protocol.vercel.app/docs\n\nDocuments for xRepo Lending Protocol: https://scife-xrepo.vercel.app/docs",

And LATAM, a region with so many financial barriers, can benefit greatly from it. But these tools are still only used by a small segment of our population. We want to bring the benefits of Stellar Network to the average person, especially to the 150M+ young adults in LATAM who already are users of mobile banking solutions. There's a lot of momentum in Latam (specially Brazil) for truly building user focused financial solutions, due to Open Banking. Now, the user owns his data and can share it in order to pursue better options for himself, not only on what his own bank/broker can offer. We already operate in Brazil, serving 9000+ active users. Oinc is similar to the US-based service called Acorns. Especially built for Brazilians our system automates the process of saving and investing. We want to create our new infrastructure using Stellar, to be able to expand it to more countries across LATAM. Our first priority is to launch a digital wallet to support Stellar assets such as USDC and digital BRL. Wallets will represent the individual accounts and support cash-in/cash-out, pay and exchange money. Second, we need to enable the users to invest/exchange asset-backed tokens and stablecoins of stronger currencies. Third, we need to connect the Open Banking infrastructure with the new solution. And after having a broader understanding of what can be best for the user, enjoy possibilities to use Stellar infra on lending, international wire, and more. In that way, using crypto/blockchain potential to provide a simple and efficient financial solution for young adults, while also making it easier for them to hold assets in a stronger currency and move money. Thus, providing financial freedom and wealth growth.

The resulting payment toolkit can be used by developers within the Stellar ecosystem. In a future proposal, these payment channels can be extended to State Channels or other functionalities such as cross-chain swaps (see Outlook).\n\nPerun Channel technology enables fast and cheap transactions on and across blockchains. The technology is based on peer-reviewed research that has been published at top conferences and is being implemented in the form of the open-source library go-perun written in Go. One of its main features is its blockchain-agnostic design, which means that most parts of the library do not depend on a concrete blockchain implementation, but are rather implemented against abstract blockchain backend components. Currently, we have backends for Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano and Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nWe propose to adapt the go-perun framework so that two-party single-asset payment channels between users on Stellar can be created, processed, closed and disputed. We propose to release this work open-source under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nWe currently focus on two-party single-asset payment channels between users on the same Stellar chain. For the future, we consider adding state channel functionality, multi-asset support, multi-party support, and cross-chain functionality for establishing channels between Stellar and all other chains supported by Perun.",

Available within Basement’s free tier, for a testnet and its mainnet once ready. Indexing can be an expensive and time-consuming task. We assume crypto startups spend on average at least one FTE in engineering costs for their data pipelines. This data is essential to build business logic and interfaces for protocols. Basement reduces this to as little as a few lines of code, saving engineering teams tons of time. This time can now be dedicated to work on product features instead.\n\nAn indexer extracts and transforms historical and real-time data from a blockchain and converts that to a format or a set of APIs more suitable for developing applications. Indexers are crucial because execution layer nodes are optimized for write performance, resulting in slow response times when reading large sets of data. Basement connects this data to warehouses such as Postgres and Parquet, which are more suited for reading data on a large scale.\n\nThere are three different indexers we're building here:\n- Tip of the chain: To keep data real-time, we'll leverage the getLedgerEntries and getEvents RPC methods to extract new data and store that in our data warehouses used by the SQL/GraphQL API.\n- Archival: To verify state and backfill historical data, we'll build a service that parses history_archive files from Tier 1 validators. This data will then be transformed to our custom schemas and loaded into our data warehouses. Developers can then query these through SQL and GraphQL APIs in a performant way, without having to sift through these files themselves.\n- Custom primitives: Some events, such as TokenTransfers, are stored in a different table, with indices on common fields. Because these events are commonly queried, we want to make sure developers can query them without having to parse these themselves.\n\nWith SQL, developers can query transactions, events, and decoded data. With the click of a button, these queries can be turned into production-grade RESTful endpoints. SQL is well-suited for advanced analytics of on-chain interactions. Our customers on other chains use this to measure usage of their protocol, build graphs, and classify potential users based on activity. The entities that will be available through SQL are Transactions, Events, TokenTransfers, and TokenContracts. These entities can be queried through a PostgreSQL-flavored query language, using our SQL IDE available on basement.dev.\n\nAll entities in SQL will be available in GraphQL as well. GraphQL is better suited for quick data access directly in a builder's app or interface and is easy to use through our JavaScript SDK. GraphQL also offers other quality-of-life improvements, such as batch querying contract state such as Balances and Name Services, automatically decoding XDRs when available, and paginated data for easy integration into any interface.",

We will leverage this to integrate with other on/off ramps (anchors) such as AIRTM, Kado finance, possibly VISA, Circle and other anchors in the future. SEP 7 - we will help develop Stellar Pay with Jee and the SDF team. We are the main Point of Sales used within the Solana Pay ecosystem and have a wealth of insights around payments UX and want to build this for MoneyGram to utilize at their retail stores. We also want to use QR code payments to help users top up balances with the Decaf Pay product for easier sending of money. SEP 10/24 - we have previously built this functionality which will allow us to integrate into savings/yield functionality like Ultra Stellar, or Franklin Templeton yield/investment products. We are still researching and looking for the appropriate, safe, yield/investment options.",

I have to get payments working and get a client base on the core product, before working on more sophisticated features. The first product is a smart-phone based cross-border payments app for retail tourism-related payments, whereas the tourist and vendor will both need the app at this time, but with the goal of moving towards app to account payments. A tourist will pre-load their (recoverable) self-custody Emigro wallet through an anchor in their home country, via the Emigro interface. They're then able to travel to other countries and make cash-less and card-less retail payments where Emigro is accepted for their trip expenses via QR codes containing the vendor info plus the payment details for them to scan. With path payments the currency exchange, at the best rate, and payment is completed at the point-of-sale, therefore a traveler doesn't need to exchange and hold currencies other than their own. But, the ability to exchange and hold other currencies does exist if the traveler/vendor wants to hedge against fluctuating exchange rates. The payment will settle instantly with the vendor in the currency that they chose and can be instantly off-ramped to their bank account by their home country anchor via the Emigro interface. Although fiat-backed stablecoins are used, (with XLM as an intermediary), the traveler/vendor doesn't need any knowledge of crypto, and all of the confusing web3 UX is stripped away. The traveler/vendor doesn't have to deal with gas or wallet address strings, their wallet key is their email address or another code they choose, mimicking how Pix operates in Brazil and that others will follow. This is a safe way for people to get started with and use digital currency, and can be a gateway for future products. There are problems solved for both the travelers and the vendors; Travelers - no need to exchange and carry cash for regular tourism payments, saving money and also being less susceptible to losing money via theft - no need to carry credit cards for regular tourism payments as they're not universally accepted, the vendor may add a fee to accept the card, and international cards are not available to all (plus their high fees) - transparency regarding the fees involved in making payments, with the small on/off ramp fees, but free transfers (payments) and no markup on the exchange rate Vendors - no need to hold large amounts cash from tourism clients, with more safety and no in-person bank deposits required - no need to have a point-of-sale credit card machine if you are a very small vendor, or you can save money by accepting fewer credit cards as a larger vendor. there is also more access to consumers as only smart phones are required for the payments - instant settlement with no charge-backs, and the ability to immediately send the money to a bank account or another user (free)",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "Slender is a Soroban implementation of a P2P pooled lending protocol. Slender is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetual) or undercollateralized (single block liquidity) fashion. The interest rate in Slender is dynamically determined by the market supply and demand mechanics. Therefore, the borrow and supply interests could vary in different blocks. The main factor which the interest rate relies on is utilization which represents the relative amount of borrows to the total cash in the given market. Classical protocols such as Aave and Compound utilize step-wise functions to control interests when utilization is high. We propose to use a hyperbolic function for the same purposes, as it's smooth, doesn’t have any inflection points, and behaves similarly in nature. Slender codebase will serve as an important resource for the growth Stellar DeFi ecosystem. Providing a secure Soroban proof-of-concept implementation of the codebase will make it easier for new teams to enter the ecosystem and begin building. We will release the simple UI for the interaction with the protocol. This protocol will serve as a proof of concept and will be released as open-source software. There will be no DAO or utility token, just an open-source protocol that any Soroban project can use as a building block. We further plan to make a follow-up application that will extensively experiment with the no-liquidation approach in relation to collateralized position management within the protocol. The idea is akin to delta-hedging. The collateral portfolio will be periodically traded in and out of stablecoins depending on its performance, imitating the behavior of the protective put option and eliminating the need for position liquidation. However, we must admit that this setup is only possible with 3rd party AMM liquidity and oracles/backend to control periodic portfolio rebalancing.",

We will launch a simple demo AMM interface to showcase the new capabilities. We will experiment with various AMM design ideas and do the initial research needed to build a more complex AMM that will power Aquarius when Soroban goes live. Add Rewards for Liquidity Providers on Soroban: We plan to use Soroban to build the distribution engine for AQUA liquidity rewards. AQUA rewards will incentivize users to provide liquidity to the Soroban AMM. The distribution engine will run as a set of Soroban smart contracts (on futurenet) and will calculate and distribute liquidity rewards to LPs accordingly. This goes in line with our goals to further decentralization of Aquarius. Introduce Aquarius Users to Stellar Smart Contracts: Our goal is to familiarize the existing user base, ecosystem projects, and 122,000 AQUA token holders (165K trustline holders) with upcoming smart contracts on Stellar, and encourage them to experiment with Soroban futurenet and learn more about Soroban-powered solutions. In summary, with SCF's support, we will move towards expanding and improving Aquarius' ecosystem, leveraging Soroban's smart contract capabilities to develop innovative DeFi products.",

Once the user activates the plugin from the ChatGPT store, he can request and receive text-based, real-time information from the Stellar Blockchain and Soroban by prompting ChatGPT. The main advantage of the plugin is the improvement of usability, which will allow users and developers to use natural language to obtain data from the Stellar Blockchain and Soroban. It will also allow users to easily create transactions and send them to the Network by prompting the AI Model using natural language. In this first step, I want to implement the core functionality, so that the Arcturus Stellar ChatGPT Plugin can request and interpret data from Stellar Horizon and Soroban RPC. To do so, the Arcturus API needs to be implemented and the specifications and examples for the AI Model need to be prepared and extensively tested. Furthermore, the Arcturus Plugin will be capable of composing transactions and after external signing, able to send them to Stellar Horizon and Soroban RPC via the Arcturus API. External signing will be implemented via WalletConnect. Over time, the system will evolve by implementing different SEPs and using additional services like for example Stellar Expert and Soroban Assistant AI. Another benefit is that Arcturus can increase the visibility and popularity of Stellar and Soroban, as ChatGPT is becoming more and more popular.",

We are enabling the traditional financial system to reach a hugely in-need underserved population through a unique and proprietary driving credit score that replaces outdated inefficient risk assessment mechanisms. We are the company behind the tech: we have a mobile app with a fiat wallet, a 100% automatic back-office platform and a behavioral scoring engine that can effectively capture the risk of the customer segment we are trying to serve.\n\nIn emerging markets, inflation forces users to find alternative ways of storing value. Argentina is one of the Latin American countries hit hardest by ever-increasing inflation. With an average annual inflation rate of 24% over the past 20 years in Argentina, the depreciation of the peso ranks as the most relevant issue for Argentines. To protect themselves from devaluation, people typically preserve their wealth by exchanging the Argentine peso for the US dollar. This process usually involves opening foreign bank accounts and holding onto the physical bills at home. This leaves them with no safe way to store or use their money.\n\nWe want to enhance our value proposal, adding a USDC alternative account to our existing fiat wallet. After the implementation of the blockchain-based wallet, the user will be able to receive a Stellar address automatically, right after his KYC has been accepted. If they want to buy (or sell) USDC, they will get the transaction quote automatically in real time. We will collect the corresponding amount from the user’s national currency virtual account and will send the corresponding USDC balance to their Stellar address in a few seconds. This new feature will provide our users a new saving strategy in countries where unstable economies push them to escape from their own currency because of its constant devaluation. This happens in Argentina, where we are already operating, and other Latin American countries.\n\nWe have participated in the Stellar Community Bootcamp where we had the chance to design, prototype and validate our ideas with real users. During the interviews, 8 real users of our wallet were invited to complete 2 different processes. First, the purchase of USDC using available funds in their fiat wallet. Second, to perform a cashout of USDC to a different account. Our users are not familiar with crypto so we did some research on that as well. From all the users interviewed, only 2 mentioned that they are able to save, but 7 said they would do it through our wallet… one of them wanted to do it NOW! A few learnings in the process: wording is important… withdraw and transfer may not be understood the same way; security during cashout… some users mentioned they wanted to schedule an “automatic” purchase once they collected their wages in the wallet; and some minor details but really useful to learn! \n\nBootcamp workspace - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C6S5GRQg7Hv76Bi3An5WSomV5fln9i6v",
