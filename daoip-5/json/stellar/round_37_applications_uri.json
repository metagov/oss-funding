                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Problem  \nSending money across borders in Sub-Saharan Africa costs an average of 7.9%, compared to the global average of 6.4%, making it the most expensive remittance corridor in the world. To avoid high fees, millions are turning to stablecoins like USDC. However, converting these digital assets into local currencies remains costly, opaque, and largely informal, creating risks and inefficiencies. In many African countries, including Ethiopia, there is no formal way to off-ramp stablecoins into bank accounts and mobile money networks. Users must rely on black-market channels that are expensive, slow, and prone to fraud - further discouraging adoption and trust.  \n\nSolution  \nSmilepay is an app and API that enables users to send (off-ramp) stablecoins (USDC, EURC, PYUSD) from the U.S. and Europe directly into bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa. We integrate with regulated local banks and mobile money networks in Africa - and soon in Latin America and Asia, to provide seamless, low-cost, and fully compliant stablecoin off-ramps, making cross-border payments as easy and affordable as sending a WhatsApp message.  \n\nProduct 1 (App):  \nExample, a user can send $100 worth of PYUSD (PayPal‚Äôs stablecoin) from Venmo to the Smilepay app. From there, the user has two options: they can either instantly transfer that PYUSD peer-to-peer to another Smilepay user in Ethiopia who will receive the stablecoin directly in their wallet or they can send it to any of the 29 banks we‚Äôve integrated in Ethiopia. In the latter case, the recipient will receive the equivalent amount in Ethiopian birr (ETB), directly deposited into their bank account.  \n\nOur partner bank receives the PYUSD and can convert it into fiat currency at their discretion. This flow is straightforward to implement, as our partner banks are motivated to earn foreign exchange. Integrating PYUSD is seamless due to its upcoming support on the Stellar network (check link below üëáüèª), which Smilepay is also built on. This model is simple and straightforward to expand and will soon be extended to other African and Asian countries.  \n\nhttps://stellar.org/press/paypal-pyusd  \n\nProduct 2 (API):  \nOur API allows any regulated financial app, whether fintech, mobile banking, or crypto wallet - to offer cross border payments to Africa, Asia, and Latin America using stablecoins.  \n\nOur API customers fall into two categories:\n\na. Web3 native platforms (e.g., Venmo, Cash App, crypto wallets): If a Web3-native platform like Venmo integrates our API, users won‚Äôt need to download the Smilepay app. They can directly send PYUSD to any of the 29 integrated banks in Ethiopia and eventually to banks across all supported countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. And with just one integration with Venmo, we can serve more than +90 million people.  \n\nb. Web2 fiat based platforms (e.g., Bank of America, Zelle, ING): Our API isn‚Äôt limited to crypto-native apps. Traditional fiat-based banking apps can also integrate Smilepay API to offer international transfers through stablecoins without needing to become Web3-native themselves or disrupting the user experience. There are two key flows:  \n\n‚Ä¢ Fiat-to-fiat: A user sends local fiat (e.g., USD or EUR) from their bank app to a recipient in Africa or Asia. Behind the scenes, Smilepay API converts it into stablecoins (e.g., USDC or PYUSD), routes it efficiently through blockchain rails, and then off-ramps it into fiat in the recipient‚Äôs country, dramatically lowering costs and settlement times.  \n\n‚Ä¢ Fiat-to-stablecoin: Alternatively, the sender can choose to have the recipient receive the funds directly in stablecoins like USDC, EURC, or PYUSD, giving them access to dollarized savings and on-chain financial tools.",

Leverage Stellar Ambassadors in Ethiopia for User Acquisition  \nWe plan to collaborate closely with Stellar‚Äôs existing ambassador network in Ethiopia. These ambassadors are already engaged in blockchain education and advocacy, and can play a key role in driving adoption of our stablecoin off-ramp solution. By onboarding them as local champions of Smilepay, we‚Äôll tap into their trust networks to accelerate user sign-ups and provide direct product onboarding support, especially for freelancers, crypto users, and tech-savvy youth in Addis Ababa and other major cities.  \n\n2. Community Engagement Through Local Blockchain Events  \nWe‚Äôll organize and co-sponsor meetups, workshops, and panel discussions with Ethiopia‚Äôs growing blockchain community. These events will demonstrate how Smilepay bridges global stablecoins and local fiat, giving attendees hands-on experience with the app. We‚Äôll also host hackathons to invite developers to build with Smilepay and Stellar, deepening local ecosystem engagement and attracting integration partners.  \n\n3. Strategic Social Media Marketing & Influencer Outreach  \nOur campaign will focus on visibility through respected tech personalities in Ethiopia and the diaspora. We‚Äôll engage Ethiopian tech influencers, fintech founders, and African crypto thought leaders to post about Smilepay‚Äîhighlighting our real-time bank transfers and stablecoin use cases. This will give Smilepay credibility and boost user interest organically.  \n\n4. Cross-Marketing With Partner Bank  \nWe‚Äôll run joint campaigns with our partner bank, including shared social media announcements, radio ads, and educational posts about how Smilepay helps attract forex through stablecoins. Since the bank benefits directly from these flows, they are incentivized to promote us across their channels, branches, and user base. This partnership gives Smilepay immediate institutional legitimacy and reach within Ethiopia‚Äôs regulated financial system.",

We launched five weeks ago and are currently live on both Android and iOS in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, UAE, and Ethiopia. Users in these countries with a USD debit or credit card can send money directly to any of the 29 Ethiopian banks we‚Äôve integrated. So far, we‚Äôve processed over $9,600 in transaction volume while focusing on fixing bugs, improving the user experience, and optimizing onboarding. This initial traction has been achieved with zero paid marketing‚Äîdriven purely by word of mouth and a few organic social media posts.\n    \n1.  Every new user is automatically issued a Stellar blockchain wallet on the backend‚Äîlaying the foundation for our upcoming stablecoin off-ramping feature. Soon, users in the U.S. and Ethiopia will be able to off-ramp stablecoins like USDC and PYUSD directly into local bank accounts. Currently, as you can see on the explorer link below, the accounts created on-chain are issued our own branded stablecoin, but we are transitioning to USDC to ensure broader compatibility, trust, and liquidity.  \n    https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/STUSD-GBGOD4GCZ4DZY5UQD26LU2OGANHPTYTVO4XSEAP5ITNI6FUMSAG3QTB7-2\n    \n1.  We‚Äôve already completed a successful 2-month stablecoin off-ramp pilot with one of our Ethiopian partner banks, which demonstrated strong institutional demand. Banks are excited to participate because stablecoin and remittance flows often bypass their systems. Smilepay gives them a direct channel to capture these foreign exchange inflows‚Äîcritical in high-forex-demand markets.\n    \n1.

Creators love to finally be able to receive and withdraw their funds in Dollars anytime, from anywhere‚Äîespecially those who do not have a U.S. dollar bank account, and even those who do not even have a bank account.\n\nTipper enables content creators to receive small payments from their fans around the world and converts those payments into Digital Dollars (USDC on Stellar); this feature enables content creators to unleash revenue streams, creates new product opportunities, and allows them to be more independent and free.\n\n**After completing and being awarded a validation prize during the kickstarter program, we're have been adding those insights and suggestions into our roadmap: we are ready to hit mainnet fast, and focus on growth and scale.\n\nTipper is composed of three different modules; we'll build the first two for our initial launch\n\n-   Content creator‚Äôs hub: This is where creators can share their personal story, their passion and links to their social media and best work. This hub will allow creators to channel their following to read and learn from them,¬† and share love from their fans, as well as it being the epicenter for them to sell their artwork or subscriptions.\n    \n-   Monetizing network: Once the fan agrees to support their favorite creator‚Äôs , they are then moved to the monetizing hub, where fans select in which way they want to pay for the support they are giving. Initially card payments , as well as USDC on Stellar are enabled. In the future this will also have other less common payment methods, as well as other crypto.\n    \n-   Tipper APP: IN A FUTURE SUBMISSION we will build a non-custodial app that receives funds and withdraws to one whitelisted address to begin with, and will improve the app for our future versions, in order to improve the tipper experience. WE‚Äôll do this as a result of our interviews and first interactions with content creators, after delivering our proof-of-concept MVP in order to validate our initial kickstart findings.\n    \n\nThrough seamless integration of all its components, Tipper offers a platform that empowers content creators to monetize their passion and audience in an easy and affordable way, while automatically receiving payments via the Stellar network‚Äîhelping to drive greater adoption of Stellar, increasing demand and awareness for Stellar as the driving force on the space and a real-world tool of crypto adoption.",

There‚Äôs now no way to link that withdrawal with any deposit\n    \n-   The more deposits, the bigger the anonymity set, the more private each user is\n    \n\nHere are some of the key features we're excited to deliver:\n\n-   Privacy-preserving deposits and withdrawals, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs\n    \n-   Intuitive frontend and CLI tools, for a seamless user experience\n    \n-   An innovative compliance layer featuring:\n    \n    -   selective disclosure: users can prove the origin of funds when needed\n        \n    -   admin control on deposits: blacklisting if required\n        \n-   Modular, reusable smart contracts and circuits, enabling future ZK projects on Stellar\n    \n\nWe also take inspiration from Railgun, which has set a high bar for compliant privacy pools with features like ‚Äúprivate proof of innocence‚Äù. LumenShade is built to move Stellar in that same direction.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "ROSEN is building the next-generation social earning app, seamlessly connecting a global community through borderless, inclusive social economies. Our core innovation lies in integrating Stellar-native compliant stablecoins (USDC and eventually PYUSD) to revolutionize how users earn, transfer, and interact globally.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Stellar fits into our key features:\n\n1. 1-Click Stablecoin Onboarding (USDC & PYUSD)\n\n-   What‚Äôs being added? Streamlined Stellar Account Creation via Circle Programmable Wallets and social logins (Google, email) for instant access to Stellar-native stablecoins like USDC (and later PYUSD).\n    \n-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's account model and Circle integration abstract away crypto complexities (keys, wallet setups), lowering the barrier for non-crypto users.\n    \n-   What‚Äôs the impact? Directly solves \"Onboarding Complexity.\" Ensures our 30,000+ users and thousands of new monthly users can effortlessly use Stellar payments, driving mass adoption for global digital economy participation.\n    \n\n2. Gasless Microtransactions\n\n-   What‚Äôs being added? Enabling Stellar-native USDC (and soon PYUSD) deposits/withdrawals with ROSEN covering all network fees (XLM) via Fee Abstraction.\n    \n-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's near-zero fees ($0.00001 XLM) and native fee-sponsoring make absorbing costs viable, ensuring micro-transactions are economically sound and user-friendly.\n    \n-   What‚Äôs the impact? Directly addresses \"Global Payment Friction\" for \"Digital natives in emerging markets.\" Users transact cents without gas worries, fostering a highly active and liquid digital labor market.\n    \n\n3. Cross-Border Social Economy (In-Chat Stablecoin Payments)\n\n-   What‚Äôs being added? Integration of in-chat stablecoin payments (USDC/PYUSD on Stellar) with AI translation for features like Instant Tipping and Micro-Task Rewards.\n    \n-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's sub-5-second settlements and design for high-frequency, low-value payments enable truly instant, affordable, borderless value transfer within social interactions. Compliant stablecoins ensure trust.\n    \n-   What‚Äôs the impact? Directly tackles \"Limited Economic Opportunities\" and \"Global Payment Friction.\" Creates a liquid digital labor market, strengthens communities, and provides instant, global monetization for skills.\n    \n\n4. Global Decentralized Recruitment (Talent Matching & Community Incentives)\n\n-   What‚Äôs being added? Businesses can post jobs and pay incentives/salaries in USDC (and later PYUSD) on Stellar. We also use Stellar-native stablecoins for in-community voting and contribution rewards.\n    \n-   How does Stellar help? Stellar's speed, low cost, and transparency are ideal for P2P and community payments. Compliant stablecoins provide a reliable medium of exchange, aligning with our decentralized vision.\n    \n-   What‚Äôs the impact? Expands economic opportunities via transparent, efficient global talent matching, free from traditional banking hurdles. Strengthens decentralized social networks through instant participation incentives and rewards.\n    \n\n5. Non-Custodial Withdrawals\n\n-   What‚Äôs being added? Integration of Stellar SEP-0007 (Deep Links) for Wallet Connect, allowing users to easily withdraw their Stellar assets to preferred non-custodial wallets (e.g., Lobstr, Albedo).\n    \n-   How does Stellar help? SEP-0007 provides a seamless, secure standard for app-to-external wallet interaction, giving users self-custody over their assets without forcing a specific solution.\n    \n-   What‚Äôs the impact? Offers crucial user optionality and builds trust. Empowers users with self-custody for Stellar-native stablecoins, demonstrating commitment to user sovereignty while maintaining ease of use.",

Below, we break down the key deliverables and how each adds value to the ecosystem:\n\n1. Non-custodial USDC Wallet with Stellar SDKs\n\n-   What we're building: A mobile and web wallet that automatically creates and activates a non-custodial Stellar address (including XLM funding and USDC trustline setup).\n    \n-   Value: Enables users without crypto experience to hold digital dollars securely without relying on intermediaries. Promotes financial autonomy in inflationary economies. We will activate 14,000 wallets for our existing users, driving immediate adoption and strengthening the Stellar ecosystem.\n    \n\n2. Direct On/Off-Ramp API Integrations (LatAm & U.S.)\n\n-   What we're building: Integrations with local banks, fintechs, and payment processors via API in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, Panama, and the U.S.\n    \n-   Value: Allows users to receive USDC from abroad and convert to local fiat in minutes. Reduces reliance on slow or expensive legacy rails, and enables last-mile cash-out in underbanked areas.\n    \n\n3. USDC Remittance Transfer Layer\n\n-   What we're building: A cross-border remittance engine that enables USDC transfers across users and wallets on Stellar, using memos and unique transaction references for KYC tagging and tracking.\n    \n-   Value: Creates a transparent, auditable, and compliant remittance rail at near-zero cost, helping meet SDG 10.C by reducing fees to under 3%.\n    \n\n4. User Interface with Stablecoin Education & Local Language Support\n\n-   What we're building: A mobile/web UX optimized for first-time users of crypto wallets, with native language support and educational content around USDC, Stellar, and security.\n    \n-   Value: Increases adoption by making the wallet usable for low-tech users, including migrants and remittance recipients unfamiliar with blockchain.\n    \n\n5. SDG-Linked Social Impact Reporting Framework\n\n-   What we're building: A data layer that tracks fee reduction, access improvements, and financial outcomes per transaction to measure impact against UN SDGs (especially 10.C).\n    \n-   Value: Empowers to track measurable impact while scaling low-cost digital financial access in emerging markets.",

Every pallet scan fires a smartphone-triggered smart contract that stamps GPS and device metadata onto Stellar, giving the shipper an immutable chain-of-custody without any new hardware or connectivity burdens. This corridor is our first real-world stress-test of the logistics module and sets the groundwork for an Afghan lane now being scoped.\n\nUsing the exact same code-base, we spun up a remote-vetting application for at-risk Afghans pursuing Special Immigrant Visas.

Infrastructure investments often rely on subjective claims, limiting trust and adoption. Dobvalidator solves this by bringing auditable, revenue-based data onchain. This transparent scoring system replaces subjective trust with objective, data-driven assessments.\n\nSecond, on the operator side, infrastructure teams face limited access to decentralized funding. Even strong projects struggle with the complexity of tokenization and the absence of a reliable process. Dob Token Studio addresses this by transforming validated future cash flows into programmable tokens with automated onchain payouts. This makes infrastructure assets ready for integration into DeFi from the beginning.\n\nDobprotocol is building foundational financial infrastructure for real-world yield: secure, composable, and integration ready.\n\n  \n\nOur system consists of two core components:\n\nDobvalidator\n\nDobvalidator brings real world infrastructure data onchain through a transparent and accountable scoring process. Assessments are based on verifiable criteria, such as revenue, uptime, location, and technical specs, and are recorded onchain for public inspection. Projects are evaluated against a consistent set of risk and revenue factors. Our aim is to make this process fully transparent and auditable onchain. This approach replaces blind trust with transparent, methodical validation, ensuring only infrastructure with verifiable cash flows and operational quality can issue tokens and enter DeFi.\n\nDob Token Studio\n\nDob Token Studio is a token creation suite that issues programmable tokens backed by validated infrastructure revenue. These tokens represent future revenue streams and include built-in logic for automated, decentralized revenue sharing. Investors receive payouts directly, with no intermediaries. Tokens are composable and ready to plug into lending markets, AMMs, and dApps.\n\nBy combining Dobvalidator and Dob Token Studio, Dobprotocol transforms real-world infrastructure into yield-bearing digital assets that can be integrated across the decentralized economy.",

This consists of a 1‚Äì2 hour pre-validation session where our team meets directly with infrastructure operators to assess their project‚Äôs financial, technical, and operational readiness for tokenization.\n\nDuring this session, we provide strategic guidance, review available data, and help determine whether the project is ready to move forward with onchain validation and token issuance. If not, we prepare a readiness report outlining the gaps and next steps to qualify for tokenization in the future.\n\nThis program is Dobprotocol‚Äôs way of lowering the barrier to entry and ensuring that only serious, well-prepared infrastructure projects advance into our validation pipeline.\n\n#### Validation tiers and pricing model\n\nPost-sprint, operators move into one of three paid validation tiers based on project scale:\n\nTier: Small\n\nFee (USD): $4,500\n\nExpected Infrastructure Type: Pilots, installations under $250K\n\nTier: Medium\n\nFee (USD): $9,000\n\nExpected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure between $250K‚Äì$1M\n\nTier: High\n\nFee (USD): $18,000+\n\nExpected Infrastructure Type: Infrastructure over $1M or high complexity\n\nThese tiers allow us to serve a broad spectrum of projects, from early-stage EV networks to large-scale mining or solar deployments.\n\nOperator traction and early deployments\n\nWe‚Äôre actively validating and preparing real infrastructure projects for onchain tokenization:\n\n-   eHive (EV chargers): First validator integration completed and ready for tokenization in the Build phase. This marks our first full deployment across the validation and token issuance stack.\n    \n-   Bas3 (data centers): Validation logic is underway. We‚Äôre collaborating closely to complete the data ingestion and scoring process before designing the tokenization structure.\n    \n-   Solar and mining pipeline: We‚Äôve initiated conversations with key stakeholders in Chile‚Äôs energy and mining sectors, including outreach through the Universidad de Chile Mining Engineering alumni network. These sectors attract significant investment at the corporate level, but mid-sized operators and high-potential projects often struggle to access efficient or transparent funding.\n    \n\nTo extend our reach, we‚Äôve launched a strategic referral program targeting advisors, brokers, and consultants who are already connected to infrastructure operators, especially in mining and renewable energy. These experts often have first hand access to capital hungry projects and can help identify operators that would benefit from tokenizing their future revenue. By offering aligned incentives and a clear onboarding path, we turn industry knowledge into a scalable source of qualified leads and long term ecosystem partners.\n\n#### Revenue model\n\nOur business model is aligned with long-term platform growth and real asset performance. We monetize through:\n\n-   Investment fee: 1.5%, applied when investor funds are transferred and locked into the infrastructure-backed token issuance.\n    \n-   Management fees: 0.5%, charged on revenue streams distributed through our smart contracts.\n    \n\nThis dual-fee structure allows us to support infrastructure operators while creating a sustainable model for protocol operations and development.",

We deliver the complete protocol implementation, from smart contracts to SDKs and service frameworks, so ecosystem participants can build, operate, and integrate privacy-enabled services with reduced complexity. Our offering includes:\n\n-   Privacy Channels: On-chain Soroban solutions that maintain private UTXO ledgers, support multi-party bundled transfers, and enforce channel-specific asset and provider policies.\n    \n-   Trusted Privacy Provider (TPP) Framework: A modular off-chain relayer service that handles authenticated bundle submission. Moonlight provides a compliant-ready base implementation that can be customized and extended to meet specific regulatory needs, such as KYC or sanctions screening.\n    \n-   Moonlight SDK: A TypeScript library that abstracts UTXO key derivation, balance fragmentation, provider integration, and transaction lifecycle management, simplifying development.\n    \n-   Reference Wallet: A minimal, open-source client that connects to privacy channels via selected TPPs, enabling users to send private, self-custodied transactions with a unified UX.\n    \n-   Protocol Governance Layer: Smart contract layer for channel configuration, provider quorum management, and compliance policy enforcement at the protocol level.\n    \n\nThese components are delivered as open-source tools to reduce the entry curve for wallets, institutions, and service providers. Moonlight makes it easier to integrate privacy on Stellar while maintaining custody, composability, and regulatory flexibility.",

We track four signals: provider count, daily transactions, private TVL, and supported assets.\n\nBy Month 3 after launch, the system should look alive, not lab-grade: at least 3 production Trusted Privacy Providers, 1 live wallet integration, 25‚Äì50 private transfers per day, and roughly $100 000 locked in a single XLM privacy channel.\n\nBy Month 6 after launch, we need clear traction: 6 active TPPs, 2 additional wallets or fintech partners, 150‚Äì200 daily transfers, over $250 000 held privately, and three assets (likely XLM, USDC, EURCV) flowing through multiple channels. These numbers show that users and liquidity stick around once the novelty wears off.\n\nBy Month 12 after launch, network effects should be visible: 10 or more TPPs including at least one regulated institution, 500-plus daily transfers, $1 million in private balances, and 5 assets serviced. Hitting these marks proves Moonlight can scale privacy without draining liquidity from Stellar‚Äôs public pools and sets the stage for private Soroban-based DeFi.",
                        "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "Moonlight‚Äôs launch strategy is built around one guiding principle: make privacy on Stellar feel like an overnight upgrade, not a multi-month integration project.\n\n1- Positioning & Core Promise\n\nMoonlight turns any wallet, exchange, or fintech running on Stellar into a privacy-enabled service‚Äîwithout forcing them to cede custody or rewrite their compliance stack. Everything is open source on day one, so the community can inspect, fork, and improve the code as it grows.\n\n2- Early-Mover Focus\n\nWe will start with three launch partners already in our pipeline: xBull Wallet (retail users), Palta Labs (infrastructure), and one EU-based institution partner from Aha Labs (e.g. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, etc). Their combined user base gives us immediate real-world volume and a feedback loop to harden the product before broad release.\n\n3- Three Phases, Twelve Months\n\n-   Developer Preview (Month 1-3) ‚Äì We maintain one testnet privacy channel (XLM) and publish a TypeScript SDK, reference wallet, and tutorial quests on Stellar Quest.\n    \n-   Mainnet Pilot (Month 3-4) ‚Äì After the SDF audit, we deploy audited contracts, activate the first mainnet channel, and register a quorum of three Trusted Privacy Providers (TPPs). Aha Labs also runs its own TPP for redundancy during the launch phase.\n    \n-   Ecosystem Expansion (Month 4-12) ‚Äì We add USDC, EURCV, and two regulated assets, invite additional TPPs, and launch a permissionless-provider beta.\n    \n\n4- Adoption Channels\n\nWe rely on three low-cost levers: (a) co-marketing with partners through blog posts, X Spaces, and Stellar Meridian workshops; (b) hackathon sponsorships (e.g. Dora hackathon style) that award bounties for the best Moonlight integrations; and (c) in-wallet prompts that encourage users to upgrade to private transfers in a single click.\n\nWith a tight, phased rollout and concrete early adopters, Moonlight positions itself to become Stellar‚Äôs default privacy layer.",
                        "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Moonlight is already live on the Stellar testnet with a working proof of concept, including deployed Soroban contracts for UTXO-based transaction abstraction and off-chain components that support SEP-10-based authentication and bundle submission. This testnet implementation validates the core architecture and demonstrates the feasibility of compliant, private payments on Stellar. You can watch this demo video for more information.\n\nMoonlight is developed by Aha Labs, a leading Stellar integration partner with a proven delivery record. The team helped Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale-FORGE launch the EURCV stablecoin on Stellar, designed key portions of the Soroban/Stellar CLI, and maintains Loam, a Soroban developer toolchain with over 40K downloads across its CLI and SDK (according to Crates.io). Loam is in production or active pilots at firms like EquitX, Ziriz, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and others.\n\nMoonlight has strong early interest from the ecosystem. xBull Wallet‚Äôs maintainer plans to integrate Moonlight privacy channels in its next release. Key SDF collaborators, including Tyler van der Hoeven and Tomer Weller, have reviewed and endorsed the architecture. Palta Labs has committed to integrating Moonlight once mainnet support is live.\n\nAs part of Station F since September 2024, Aha Labs has expanded its European institutional outreach and is already working with multiple financial institutions on tokenization and payments. Moonlight serves as a natural privacy and compliance extension to these ongoing engagements.\n\nMoonlight is also part of the 2025 cohort of the DraperU X Stellar residency program.",

Using Stellar SDK and the Soroban client, the platform offers interactive visualizations, smart contract call analysis, testnet simulations, and error diagnostics. By clearly displaying the flow and structure of transactions, the tool supports both new and advanced developers building on Stellar. Future plans include providing a lightweight SDK for seamless integration into existing wallets and explorers, increasing its accessibility and ecosystem impact. This directly supports Stellar‚Äôs goal of growing a strong, tool-rich smart contract development environment.\n\nOur tool is not intended to compete with full-featured explorers like Stellar Expert, but rather to complement them by focusing specifically on transaction visualization, debugging, and Soroban smart contract introspection‚Äîfeatures not currently offered in traditional explorers.\n\nWhile Stellar Expert excels at displaying transaction data and account history, it does not provide a flow-based view or interactive debugging for Soroban contracts. Our tool bridges that gap by offering a developer-friendly visual layer that shows the sequence and relationships between operations, contract calls, and errors.\n\nTo avoid duplicating existing explorers, we plan to release an SDK that enables platforms like Stellar Expert, Freighter, or custom dApps to embed our visual flow component or debugging features within their own UI. This modular approach reduces friction and increases adoption, allowing users to access deeper transaction insights without leaving their preferred explorer.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to integrate rather than compete, making our tool a back-end service and front-end component that can serve the broader Stellar ecosystem and enhance the debugging experience across tools.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Executive Summary:  \nAs AI agents become more prevalent in fintech and automation, developers need secure ways to let those agents interact with blockchain contracts. The Stellar AI Agent Kit offers the first complete toolchain for safely connecting AI agents to Soroban contracts using MCP servers and delegated signer infrastructure.\n\nThe Stellar AI Agent Kit is a secure developer toolkit designed to make Soroban contracts safely accessible to AI agents. It enables developers to expose contracts via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, while also providing signer infrastructure and testing tools to ensure predictable, permissioned execution.\n\nImportant note: This toolkit does not use LLMs to write or generate contracts. Developers still write their own contracts. The tools in this kit help generate supporting infrastructure‚Äîsimilar to how TypeScript bindings are generated from existing specs‚Äînot the core logic.\n\n1. MCP Server Generator (CLI Plugin)\n\nParses Soroban contract interfaces to generate MCP-compliant server bindings in both TypeScript and Python, following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard.\n\nImpact: This is not an AI tool writing contracts. It‚Äôs a developer utility‚Äîlike TypeScript binding generators‚Äîthat translates a contract‚Äôs existing spec into a format that AI agents can safely understand and call. With Python support, this makes Stellar contracts accessible from AI development platforms like LangChain, OpenAI, and Claude, without any backend boilerplate.\n\n2. Policy Signer Generator (Interactive CLI)\n\nA structured, interactive CLI that generates scoped signer rules from contract interfaces, allowing developers to define secure, rule-based policies for delegated execution.\n\nImpact: This tool does not use AI or natural language processing. It‚Äôs a straightforward developer utility‚Äîlike a configuration assistant‚Äîthat helps builders define signer logic using structured inputs. By leveraging the Soroban contract spec, it guides developers through permission setup (e.g. function-level access, destination restrictions, quotas) and outputs deployable signer configurations. This eliminates the need to write custom signer logic in Rust, while giving developers full control over what agents are authorized to do. It's an essential bridge to adopt Stellar‚Äôs powerful Policy Signers without deep protocol expertise.\n\n3. Policy Sandbox Web App\n\nA visual, browser-based simulator for testing how Policy Signers behave during various contract calls and transactions.\n\nImpact: Before connecting agents to real wallets, developers need to validate their signer logic. The Sandbox allows them to create test wallets, assign policies, simulate contract calls, and observe whether the signer allows or rejects the request‚Äîmaking it easier to debug and onboard safely.\n\n4. MCP Client SDK (npm)\n\nAn SDK to simulate transactions, manage delegated signing, and submit them to Stellar, fully integrated with MCP server outputs and smart wallet models.\n\nImpact: This SDK enables real applications‚Äîbots, voice agents, UIs‚Äîto safely interact with Soroban contracts through previously defined signer rules. With no need for full private key access, apps can execute contract logic within secure, delegated boundaries, guided by the developer‚Äôs own permissions setup.\n\n-  \n\nTogether, these tools form secure infrastructure‚Äînot speculative AI automation. They support developers by reducing boilerplate, enabling safe agent interactions, and enforcing strict contract-level controls across the entire lifecycle.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Indentura lets borrowers pledge high-quality offchain collateral and draw on stablecoin credit lines from a global onchain liquidity pool. Our offchain infrastructure gives lenders enforceable legal claims and real-time visibility into collateral while preserving borrower privacy.\n\nOur first product enables speciality lenders to access revolving credit lines to manage cash flow more effectively and also offer similar revolving products to SMEs.\n\nTo do so, we‚Äôre developing three key pieces of infrastructure:\n\n1.  Soroban Credit Vaults: Vaults that support ERC-4626 behavior on deposit and ERC-7540 on withdrawal, adapted to Soroban‚Äôs native architecture. At a high level, a lender deposits Stellar USDC into a vault, and receives in return a yield-bearing receipt/share token representing its position. The vault allocates all deposited capital into whitelisted protocols to generate yield. When a borrow wants to draw down a credit line, a designated MPC wallet calls a function to unwind yield positions and release stablecoins or offramped USD to the borrower. Interest is accrued and tracked on a block-by-block basis. This represents a new asset primitive for the Stellar ecosystem and an adaptable vault standard that leverages best practices from EVM protocols to interface between onchain and offchain capital flows, driving real-world utility to Soroban.\n    \n1.  Custody and Compliance: Vault depositors require a legal security interest over the collateral backing their credit exposure. Borrowers, in turn, require institutional-grade interfaces, including bank accounts for fund disbursement and MPC wallets to manage on-chain obligations. This demands a legal and operational layer built around bankruptcy-remote SPVs that support custody, loan servicing, and payment flow management on behalf of vault participants. We‚Äôre building the robust, institutional-grade bridge required for assets to flow safely between traditional legal structures and the Stellar network.\n    \n1.  Reporting and Automation: Moving funds from a Stellar USDC vault deposit to a borrower‚Äôs bank account involves treasury operations across various systems, including yield management, compliance checks, and disbursements. On repayment, syncing borrower data back to on-chain vault interfaces requires connecting private data warehouses with privacy-preserving pipelines. This infrastructure ensures capital flows and reporting are seamless, secure, and trustworthy for all participants.\n    \n\nThis grant will allow us to develop and launch these infrastructure components on Soroban, beginning with a live credit facility for a U.S.-based specialty lender. It‚Äôs the first step toward building stablecoin-native credit rails that are programmable, transparent, and globally accessible.",

                        "stellar.successCriteria": "We‚Äôll consider this build successful if we meet the following criteria:\n\n-   One real-world borrower is live on mainnet, accessing a stablecoin-denominated credit line via Soroban vault infrastructure.\n    \n-   One lender vault is deployed and capitalized, with $500k of Stellar USDC earning yield via a mix of DeFi strategies and borrower repayment.\n    \n-   At least one half of a repayment cycle is completed, demonstrating stablecoin flow from vault to borrower and back through fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure.\n    \n-   All supporting infrastructure is live: custody (MPC), legal structure (SPV), and lender-facing reporting.\n    \n-   End-to-end flows are auditable via on-chain data and off-chain reporting, ensuring transparency for vault participants and protocol stakeholders.\n    \n\nImpact:\n\nThis launch will demonstrate that stablecoins can serve as more than just payment rails. They can function as the foundation for programmable, enforceable credit infrastructure. That opens the door to:\n\n-   Improved capital access for businesses excluded from traditional credit.\n    \n-   New sources of yield for lenders seeking real-world exposure beyond volatile DeFi tokens.\n    \n-   A new class of financial products on Stellar that serve real economic activity.\n    \n\nThis deployment will serve as a reference implementation for future vaults and borrowers, laying the foundation for permissionless credit infrastructure across the Stellar ecosystem.",
                        "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "We‚Äôre sequencing our go-to-market by pairing crypto-native capital with real-world borrowers, starting with a market wedge where stablecoin mechanics unlock new products that banks and credit funds can‚Äôt offer.\n\nOur distribution strategy scales both capital and credit demand, with each phase unlocking new types of depositors and borrowers. A more detailed view into our 4-phase expansion plan can be found in the Indentura Thesis Document here: https://www.notion.so/indentura/Indentura-Thesis-Document-225c4663170780adb8e5de0045ac1224.\n\nInitial Borrower Strategy\n\nOur first borrower will be a U.S.-based specialty finance company that originates term loans or revenue based financing to small businesses and has expressed explicit demand for a revolving credit structure. We are collaborating directly with this partner to structure the initial facility, validate the legal + off-chain infrastructure, and confirm repayment data flows.\n\nThis initial borrower relationship gives us:\n\n-   A controlled underwriting + servicing relationship.\n    \n-   Clear operational requirements for drawdowns and repayments.\n    \n-   A proving ground for cross-chain and off-chain capital orchestration.\n    \n\nInitial Lender Strategy\n\nOur first vault will be capitalized through closely held sources: the team, advisors, and aligned partners with experience in DeFi and credit underwriting. These stakeholders understand the risk profile and serve as both early liquidity providers and feedback channels.\n\nWe especially want to focus on lenders who already have positions in DeFi protocols, as Indentura provides an additional way to stack yield on top of their existing positions.\n\nThis demonstrates:\n\n-   Programmatic yield movement between DeFi and borrower capital.\n    \n-   Stablecoin liquidity that can be committed, drawn down, and repaid.\n    \n-   Transparent, auditable performance and credit behavior.\n    \n\nFuture Growth\n\nOnce the first facility is live and stable, we will expand across both borrower and lender channels:\n\n-   Borrower side: additional specialty finance firms, fintechs offering embedded credit products, and eventually businesses operating entirely on stablecoins.\n    \n-   Lender side: crypto-native family offices, DAO treasuries, and eventually fintechs or neobanks embedding Indentura-powered yield products.\n    \n\nOver time, we aim to support the creation of permissionless credit vaults, enabling anyone to launch programmable credit pools backed by real-world collateral, with Stellar serving as the primary infrastructure layer for compliance, liquidity, and settlement.",
                        "stellar.tractionEvidence": "Our approach to validation is grounded in our team‚Äôs experience in the credit industry. Our founder, Tom Meister, has structured debt transactions at both funds and fintechs, led legal and operations at unicorn fintech companies, and advised and backed leading DeFi lending protocols. His background gives us confidence that this pain point, the absence of flexible, programmable credit infrastructure, is both acute and systemically underserved.\n\nThat perspective led us to validate the problem directly with our target users: nonbank specialty lenders. We‚Äôve already received clear confirmation through direct conversations and formal letters of support, one of which is enclosed below.\n\nThe lender, a U.S.-based specialty finance firm originating term loans to SMBs, provided a signed letter describing the structural challenge: they cannot access or offer revolving credit due to limitations in how their capital sources operate, and the inefficiencies of traditional financial rails.\n\nIn the letter, their CEO writes:\n\n‚ÄúIf lenders like [us] could draw on a revolving credit facility in stablecoins, we would incur significantly lower interest costs and could pass the savings along to our borrowers... We would be interested in piloting a borrower-facing revolving credit facility backed by stablecoins.‚Äù\n\nHe also confirms this is an industry-wide issue:\n\n‚ÄúVirtually none of ‚Ä¶ businesses [like ours] are able to access revolving bank lines of credit, and so we are forced to obtain term loan credit facilities that present the financial drawbacks I have described above. This puts businesses like [ours], and the small and medium sized businesses we serve, in a much worse position than we would be in if revolving credit were available.‚Äù\n\nThe full letter is enclosed and signed. We‚Äôre currently in active discussions with other specialty lenders facing the same problem and can secure additional letters over the coming weeks, if needed. We have also received interest from a venture philanthropy looking to deploy this type of solution within their market. A copy of their signed letter of support is also attached.\n\nThis validation affirms strong borrower demand and growing pull from institutional participants who, while traditionally unfamiliar with crypto, are eager to adopt Stellar-based solutions that solve real-world capital inefficiencies.\n\nSupport letters are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LGQLNPqNh380raMT_UG2hRzAagavhi8i?usp=sharing.",
