driven sustainability, and obtained ANBI status as a Public Benefit Organization. \n- Adapted our legal framework to steward-ownership. \n- Setbacks with pilot projects due to licensing issues.\nMarch 2024 \n- Established ReFi The Hague as a local node during the ReFi DAO incubator program.\nAugust 2024\n- Apply for GG21 Genesis and Real World Builders rounds.\n- Continue developing on the Celo platform, hiring experts from the ReFi network, and cross-pollinating with other nodes and Web3 projects globally and locally.\nSeptember 2024\n- Map out The Hague’s Web3 space and connect.\n- Finalize the legal setup for steward-ownership and DAO integration.\n- Host our first educational event \n- Publish our whitepaper and explanatory videos.\nOctober 2024\n- Deploy Volunteer Interface 1.0 \n- Launch the community marketplace.\n- Mint equity tokens to support local sustainable projects.\nNovember 2024\n- Launch the DAO \n- Commence our AgriVoltaic pilot project.\n\n\n## Focus Areas\n### Community Building\n- **Engage** The Hague’s residents by offering opportunities to contribute time, skills, and resources toward sustainability.\n- **Grow** the ReFi The Hague community from 4 to 20 members, and attract 100+ volunteers through local events and the Volunteer The Hague platform.  \n\n### Web3 Integration\n- Receive **expert input in our Whitepaper** from Web3 experts within the ReFi and Celo community.\n- Finalize and launch test **equity token** and a **community Marketplace**.\n- Develop a **DAO** and additional (soulbound) tokens to facilitate transparent decision-making and empower community ownership.\n\n### Web3 Awareness\n- **Educate** 100+ local volunteers on Web3 through monthly training sessions and informative content on our YouTube channel.\n\n### Collaborative Projects\n- Launch our collaborative **AgriVoltaics pilot project**, allowing community members to co-own and benefit from sustainable food and energy production.\n\n## Programs\n### Volunteer Program\n- Host volunteer coffee **meetups** to engage with new and existing volunteers from The Hague.\n- Launch the **Volunteer Portal 1.0**, providing access to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, ClickUp, Figma, Canva, tutorials, and relevant documentation.\n- Hold a **strategic/governance meeting** to establish OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and timeline.\n\n### Educational Program\n- Host our first **open educational event**.\n- Launch a YouTube channel to **explain Web3 concepts** and their relevance to our community.\n\n### Sustainable Investment Program\n- Mint and **deploy the first 1,000 equity tokens on the Celo network**, backed by €1,000 in the holding’s bank account.\n- **Deploy the marketplace**, allocating €500 to stock it with sustainable items and services, and another €500 to the liquidity pool for token sales.\n- **Test the marketplace** by distributing 500 tokens to volunteers as a reward for their contributions.\n\n## Challenges & Opportunities\nOur main challenge lies in setting up Web3 tools, integrating them with real-life projects, and engaging local supporters in decision-making. However, The Hague's international, forward-thinking population and our established volunteer base position us for success.\n\n## Support Us\nTo complete this stage of our Web3 development, we are seeking between €2,500 and €50,000 to cover expenses for expert advice, reviews, development tools, and deployment. These funds will flow back into the ReFi and Celo ecosystems, helping us finalize our infrastructure and operations with valuable input from within these networks.\n\n## Key Milestones\n- **Finalized legal framework** for steward-ownership, tokenization, and decision-making via DAO, connecting the NGO, Holding, and SPV.\n- Completed Development of **Web3 tools** (Tokens and DAO)\n- Live local

collaboration between ReFi Phangan and GreenPill Phangan represents a powerful synergy aimed at driving environmental and community-focused initiatives on Koh Phangan. Through coordinated efforts, both on the ground and online, we are building a regenerative infrastructure that not only addresses immediate environmental challenges but also fosters long-term sustainability and community empowerment.\n\n**GreenPill Phangan: Pioneering Regeneration Infrastructure**\n\nGreenPill Phangan is dedicated to developing local regeneration infrastructure to enhance public good funding on Koh Phangan. One of our flagship initiatives is the establishment of the [Phangan QF (Quadratic Funding) round](https://x.com/PhanganQF/status/1768143086486741492), envisioned as a biannual event to support projects that deliver tangible impact for the island. With the support of ReFi Phangan in community and NGO onboarding, we successfully gathered $10,000 for our first round, planned for Q4 2024.\n\n**Joint Initiatives with ReFi Phangan**\n\n##Decentralized Cleanup Network Partnership:## ReFi Phangan and GreenPill Phangan have teamed up to conduct joint cleanup initiatives, working alongside the Decentralized Cleanup Network. These cleanups are a testament to our shared commitment to environmental stewardship and community engagement, removing significant amounts of waste from the island’s natural environments.\n\n##Onboarding Events and Workshops:## Together, we organize in-person onboarding events and workshops aimed at introducing the local community, NGOs, and individuals to web3 technologies and regenerative finance principles. These events are crucial in building a foundation of knowledge and engagement, fostering a community that is actively involved in sustainable practices.\n\nOur collaboration extends to supporting ReFi Phangan's **Re:Plast project**, particularly by integrating it into a broader cryptoeconomics framework and aiding in fundraising efforts. This partnership not only strengthens our initiatives but also ensures that our collective impact is maximized.\n\n**ReFi Phangan: Towards a Sustainable Future through Regenerative Finance**\n\nReFi Phangan's mission aligns seamlessly with GreenPill Phangan's vision, as both organizations are deeply committed to addressing environmental issues on Koh Phangan through innovative approaches. Our focus on community engagement, coupled with the adoption of web3 technologies, allows us to amplify our impact across various initiatives, including waste management and the establishment of a full-circle plastic recycling facility.\n\n##Cleanups and Environmental Initiatives:## ReFi Phangan aims to increase the frequency and scale of cleanup activities on Koh Phangan. This initiative will help reduce plastic pollution and prepare the population to follow important steps in plastic waste management, which are essential for succeeding with the next goal.\n\n##Re:Plast Recycling Facility:## Our epic goal is to benefit the environment of the entire island by organizing and providing the necessary support for the local government or village community to start running a dedicated recycling center for converting plastic waste into sustainable products based on the [Precious Plastic program](https://www.preciousplastic.com). This will build local recycling infrastructure, engage the community in recycling practices, and produce eco-friendly products that will become an additional source of income for the local economy.

By combining ecological restoration with community-driven innovation, we aim to create a sustainable, circular model that benefits both ecosystems and local communities.  \n\n### **Key Projects & Progress**  \n1. **Regen Tourist Hub / Co-Working Spaces**  \n   - **Problem Addressed**: Fragmented knowledge-sharing and lack of physical spaces for collaboration in regenerative agriculture and web3 ecosystems.  \n   - **Solution**: Establishing a hub in Kenya to host workshops, attract global web3 leaders (e.g., Celo, Vitalik Buterin), and foster partnerships.  \n   - **Progress**: Hosted 3 events (150+ attendees), positioning Kenya as a nexus for regenerative and web3 innovation.

**Organic Fertilizer Production**  \n   - **Problem Addressed**: Reliance on synthetic fertilizers and poor soil health in agriculture.  \n   - **Solution**: Scaling compost/biochar production (5+ tonnes made) to replace chemicals, improve soil, and reduce waste.  \n   - **Link to Farming**: Directly supplies your regenerative farming initiatives.

Deforestation and unsustainable farming practices.  \n   - **Solution**: Planting 100+ trees using organic fertilizer, creating a closed-loop system (fertilizer → crops → carbon sequestration).  \n\n [![IMG-20250115-185047.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NG67C4DF/IMG-20250115-185047.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/xqdzcLWV)\n\n---\n\n### **Impact & Synergies**  \n- **Environmental**: Improved soil health, carbon capture via trees, and reduced chemical use.  \n- **Community**: Educated 50+ participants on web3/regeneration, fostering Kenya’s role as a global hub.  \n- **Economic**: Revenue from the Regen Hub and fertilizer sales aim to sustain operations long-term.  \n\n### **Challenges & Strategic Opportunities**  \n- **Hurdles**: High upfront costs for the hub and scaling fertilizer production.  \n- **Opportunities**:  \n  - Leverage Kenya’s growing web3 reputation to attract funding.  \n  - Strengthen synergies (e.g., hub educates farmers, fertilizer boosts yields, tree planting offsets emissions).  \n\n**Overall Vision**: A self-sustaining ecosystem where regenerative agriculture, web3 innovation, and community education reinforce each other to combat climate change and economic

unique capabilities to foster a global movement. Over the past three years, our strategic alignment with Celo has showcased the blockchain's potential and driven adoption and application across diverse projects and communities. Our work has helped Celo attract more innovative projects and community engagement, driving further growth and establishing a solid foundation for future developments within the blockchain and ReFi sectors. Some highlights include:\n\n- **Impact Tracking and Hypercerts**: We have launched a pilot for impact tracking using hypercerts minted on Celo. We developed a detailed minting guide and supported 15 nodes in creating their first hypercerts, with plans to initiate a retroactive funding round to reward high-impact projects. This initiative highlights how ReFi DAO utilizes Celo’s blockchain capabilities to enhance transparency and accountability in tracking regenerative impacts.\n- **Celo Integration and Operations**: ReFi DAO has integrated Celo into our operations across all nodes, including the creation of over 23 Celo SAFEs for financial management, hypercerts for impact reporting, and Celo NFT collections. We support the development of further tools on Celo, such as working with Karma GAP to deploy their platform on Celo and onboard our community.

Through the vehicle of Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and Web3, our initiative aims to foster a new economy that values human and natural capital, aligns financial gain with planetary health, and supports local communities in their long-term regenerative efforts. \n\nIn 2023, we supported the launch of about a dozen ‘ReFi Local Nodes’ globally with the Alpha Cohort of our ReFi Local Node Incubator, and allocated over $55,000 to their work via Gitcoin rounds. In the first half of 2024, we overhauled the curriculum and ran a Beta Cohort, further growing the network. Now, we have helped raise $110k to launch the Regen Coordi-Nation Program. \n\nLooking ahead, through strategic partnerships and otherwise aligned initiatives, we aim to further expand our work in supporting Local Node Operators in driving local innovation, enhancing community connectivity, and supporting verifiable local regenerative activities using Web3.\n\n# **What are ReFi Local Nodes? 🗺**\n\n“Local Nodes” are, as the name implies, place-based initiatives for learning about, experimenting with, and implementing regenerative financial practices and technologies. They provide a context for local organizers and leaders of all kinds to signal their values-alignment, interest and willingness to take tangible steps towards a more regeneratively oriented future.

This includes:\n\n- **MycoFi for Municipal Resilience**: Led by ReFi DAO Core Steward and “MycoFi” co-creator Scott Morris alongside a dozen social and regenerative finance industry veterans, this initiative seeks to research various mechanisms and strategies for creating resilience and antifragility in place based economies on the municipal and community levels, and contextualize those into a playbook for local policy makers, economic developers, funders, and Local Node organizers. It expects to build out this resource in a way that adds to the Local Node Toolkit and aligned contexts across the web3 for good space.\n- **Bioregional Builders**: Co-led by stakeholders from OpenCivics, Celo, and ReFi DAO, the Bioregional Builders initiative aims to enhance connectivity between builders, developers, and community organizers at the bioregional scale, facilitating collaboration to design infrastructures that support regenerative economies and bioregional governance. Additionally, we plan to actively support this project by mapping ReFi Local Nodes, GreenPill Local Chapters, and other regionally-based ReFi/Web3/Climate projects to identify potential collaborations. We are also exploring opportunities to support the first bioregional Quadratic Funding (QF) round.\n- **Prosperity Passport**: ReFi DAO is leading the product design and partnership development for ‘Prosperity Passport,’ a smart account on Celo that features a dynamic dashboard highlighting an individual’s contributions within the ecosystem. Built on Superchain Accounts by Kolektivo Labs, this new identity application aims to showcase participation, impact, and community representation.

Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO)\n\nFAB DAO, also known as Formosa Art Bank DAO, is a self-governing organization for charity NFTs since 2021. The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public.

The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\n# Background\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations. As one of the pioneers in Public Goods, GreenPill would like to share its experience and develop local chapters for different cities over the world.\n\nWhen two communities connected with each other, the idea of Taiwan Chapter was born.\n\nMission & Vision, Value alignment\n\nGreen Sofa aligns with the mission and vision of GreenPill, which is to build a global network society transcending national and cultural boundaries, while exporting regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.\n\nAs one team under FAB DAO, Green Sofa aims to explore the possiblity of collaboration wtih Greenpill international and FAB DAO. It is a school for FAB DAO learning from GreenPill about Public Goods, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack. It is also a laboratory for FAB DAO to apply the knowledge, kick off hands-on projects in smaller scale, to gain local experiences and feedback to FAB DAO and GreenPill.\n\nCritical success factors\n\nIncrease awareness of the Greenpill and look for collaboration opportunity with FAB DAO\n\nLearn and apply Greenpill related tools and knowledge to support FAB DAO development, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack, Hypercert.\n\nAct as the communication channel between FAB DAO and Greenpill International and other local chapters.\n\n# Hypercert project: Tamagochi at Riverside\n\nProject Website: https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region\n\n[Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n![Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192&w=640&q=75)\n\n# 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling  \nIn rapidly urbanized cities like Taipei, rivers are often overlooked, over-dredged, and stripped of biodiversity. The Huangxi River (Southern Sulfur Creek), once teeming with life, has seen its ecosystem disrupted by aggressive vegetation clearing and human detachment. Shy native species like the White-breasted Waterhen have nearly vanished from view. If we don't act now, we risk losing not only vital habitats but also the community's connection to the very nature flowing beside them.\n\n---\n\n# 📜 Our Solution  \n**Tamagochi at Riverside** brings together environmental education, civic action, and Web3 technology to rewild our imaginations—and our rivers. Partnering with Huangxi Environmental Education Programme (HEEP) and Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO), we designed a playful, powerful campaign where students and citizens alike complete ecological missions, earn interactive NFTs, and re-learn how to live with rivers as neighbors. Through school programs, community workshops, and NFT collectibles, we’re rebuilding bonds between people and place—and helping wildlife thrive again.\n\n---\n\n# 🌱 Our Organisation / Community  \nWe are a collaboration between **HEEP**, a grassroots environmental education initiative, and **FAB DAO**, a Web3 collective focused on public good. Together, we’ve built a vibrant, decentralized community of educators, parents, artists, technologists, and river-lovers. We’ve reached **50,000+ local residents**, **20+ community partners**, and over **3,000 students and parents** from Mingde Elementary School alone.\n\n[GreenSofa_TW](https://hackmd.io/@greensofa/home) |  [FAB FAO](https://fabdao.world/) |  [HEEP](https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region)\n\n---\n\n# 🖼️ See Our Impact  \n- [Tamagochi at Riverside NFT](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14470)  \n- [Heart of the River Corridor POAP](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14471)\n\n---\n\n# 🔗 [View Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n---\n\n# 📝 What This Hypercert Represents  \nBetween **March and December 2023**, we ran school-wide ecological challenges, issued **300+ proof-of-attendance NFTs (POAPs)**, hosted over **10 public events**, and piloted habitat recovery in **2 riverbank zones**. We replaced top-down conservation messaging with community-led learning. Students adopted digital Waterhen “pets,” learned through play, and became stewards of real-world habitats—helping restore native biodiversity and reshape urban watershed governance.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ Proof That It’s Working  \nNative species like the **White-breasted Waterhen** have dewelled to rehabilitated zones. Over **300 NFTs** were minted to mark engagement. Student feedback and observational data confirm increased ecological awareness and behavioral change.  \n\n📂 [See the Proof of Impact](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXgtcFSb46AR2ktN9Dq2R3CYoUXnr_Td?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n# 💡 Join Us in Making a Difference!  \nYour support helps us scale this playful, powerful model to other schools, rivers, and cities. Let’s turn digital tools into real-world transformation—one river, one community, one Waterhen at a time. **Donate, collaborate, and help us build a greener, more connected future today.**\nGreenSofa past achievement\n\nQ1 2025\n\nWe will interview 18 public goods communities and individuals and follow up their achievement since participating our 1st Grant is Great round.\nBound and small grant will be allocated to support their development.\n\nhttps://x.com/GreenSofa_TW/status/1866096968809984155\n\nMint GIVETH NFT to participate in GIVETH coming QF round\nhttps://x.com/GreenSofa_TW/status/1861046543941243254\n\nSelect 3rd steward: Swift Evo\nhttps://x.com/GreenSofa_TW/status/1873892129371808180\n\n2024 Summary:\n\nWeekly Web meeting with FAB DAO Discord - GreenSofa channel\n\nRegular update with GreenPill.network\n\nFollow up “Grant is Great!” QF round on 2023 by survey and 1 on 1 discussion on Q1 2024\n\nThe 2nd grant as retroPGF format to reward Taiwan individual and commmunity for public goods\n\nhttps://reportcards.gitcoin.co/10/0xe9459565709c5e856ffbc3cc8715824945d92de7\n\nAchievement in 2024\n\n2024-07:\n\nInvite OP 中文力量 Marcus (Optimism_cn) update Optimism retroPGF 5, discuss Green Sofa easy retroPGF to GreenSofa.\n\n2024-06:\n\nGreen Sofa first NFT on akaSwap platform on Tezos chain\n\nhttps://www.akaswap.com/akaobj/25336\n\n2024-03: Successfully raised funds on Greenpill x Octant Community Round, and we extend special thanks to the Octant community!

It aims to bring **transparent micro-granting infrastructure** to our community, using ERC-20 compatible tokens like cREAL.\n\nWe’re currently exploring and implementing two Cookie Jars:\n- One for the **GreenPill Brasil Council** (our main governance body).\n- One for the **Guardians** (our distributed community stewards).\n\nThese Jars will serve as onchain grant pools that reward verified regenerative contributions, reinforce autonomy in coordination, and support distributed decision-making.\n\n### Climate Megazord Coordination via Gardens\n\nIn parallel, we are consolidating our [Climate Megazord](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGYTqqLdlA/5iEk5mpI4k1jAkVh2NhxsA/view?utm_content=DAGYTqqLdlA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h6f2da95b9b) as our long-term climate resilience protocol. It follows three pillars:\n- **Prediction** (early signals and local climate data).\n- **Adaptation** (community infrastructure and preparedness).\n- **Response** (coordinated action during disasters).\n\nGovernance and resource allocation for this protocol is coordinated via [Gardens v2](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/137/0x6fac69b92b1943da2a8ff99e3687451f10066018/0x65bf57a410ed5fa69669f307c2da65eae06279f4), using signaling and conviction voting mechanisms.\n\n### Glocalism Collaboration\n\nOur alliances span from local agroecology task forces (e.g. SAF do Futuro, Morro da Redenção) to the global Ethereum Localism movement and ecosystem allies like Celo and Gitcoin. GreenPill Brasil is committed to being a bridge between grassroots regeneration and resilient coordination tech.\n---\n## How the Funds Will Be Used\n\nThis new phase is about **laying the groundwork for long-term regeneration** by creating the digital infrastructure that empowers communities, codifies trust, and fuels decentralized action.\n\nThe requested funds for this cycle will be focused on:\n- **Deploying and operationalizing two Cookie Jars** for internal micro-funding coordination (Council & Guardians).\n- **Coordinating and documenting the Climate Megazord infrastructure**, including governance cycles on Gardens.\n- **Sustaining direct funding for grassroots regen activities** via [Charmverse proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpillbrasil/proposals) under our Regen Incentives campaign.\n- **Scale our onboarding and funding processes** to support more projects and regional nodes.\n- **Refine our decentralized protocols**, integrating tools like [Impact Miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=pt_BR&pli=1), and the evolving [GreenGoods app](https://greengoods.app) (with new in-app plant ID features).\n- **Expand partnerships** with AgroforestDAO, Fabulosa Lab, Celo Public Goods, Celo Europe, and others to co-create more inclusive and impactful regenerative ecosystems.\n---\n## **Join Us in Building a Future**\n\nGreenPill Brasil is not just a project—it’s a movement. Your support will help us build a infrastructure that scales trust, amplifies grassroots agency, and coordinates regenerative action across Brazil and beyond.\n\n[telegram](https://t.me/+6GlufLobfMRiMTIx)\n\n**Let’s regenerate, one step at a time.** \n\n[![Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/90LYfY0C/Gpbr-climate-megazord-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/kRtb18Wp)\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"greenpillbrasil"},"metadataCid":"bafkreidrlvhpvapuueam6tpkzemfxzggfzgwuecsdjls4uxssfs7pg444e","timestamp":"2024-03-20T07:03:12+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x8C180840fcBb90CE8464B4eCd12ab0f840c6647C","createdAtBlock":192256554},{"name":"GreenPill Brasil - GG21","id":"0x7e215e52873adcf476ab86f5f66282a87740c8a90fde4991cbeec376530ef242","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-03T01:36:36+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x53b00300EFF94D750b4893CCA4Ef23Ba9F14eE18","createdAtBlock":26995400}],"projectId":"0x7e215e52873adcf476ab86f5f66282a87740c8a90fde4991cbeec376530ef242","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":3}},"roundId":"14","status":"PENDING","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-03T02:07:41.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"26995773"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T13:46:19.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27038710"},{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T13:54:29.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27038808"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27208335,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-03T02:07:41+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0xBc334b5d3063220a8df58DdFD4240AA4a6a188A5","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":27007872,"createdByAddress":"0xCe849efC35A0a0a046E67c76B477c5432E4BA58b","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"11","metadata":{"signature":"0x810626bcbeb54718f8bcf383fe2f6010fe425eadaecbc3b1a341dbb6ebf760c829f9f2f3335dbdb39d8f765030822a3a2a58afe1f6c693d3ad330f25cb8b31241c","application":{"round":"0x6f8291eafc6b4933896f7d2575bd2fc930dea6a2","answers":[{"type":"email","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0,"encryptedAnswer":{"ciphertext":"BAanN0ljkZ2yC4Paj6WHfwEDm09W44oaulYtyuPSZTMq47UtTCJk4zEiSZRfLgSB","encryptedSymmetricKey":"310255ba5a962f33aa56baf98763dd3b311149056e64ae21dc9143751ddfd2ac6650fdccce821a89f0ef90cfc294291057ab4b68069c78dc1633f430c22258350a7e249156024b36b64fb72eb262403597af00be3bd7cbfb5115dadeba1c089774a54e603775fc766d3bebb6325b9d4806e5efd1a46964f43579277392552648000000000000002053b8a7e2ad1cde2d5d69b26e6c993c5607077b92133d46e3d1dc47ac30a424e9b1ed117d1a4f3cd6e14b7a53585b4b86"}},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Grants","hidden":false,"question":"Funding Sources","questionId":1},{"type":"number","answer":"5","hidden":false,"question":"Team Size","questionId":2},{"type":"paragraph","hidden":false,"question":"Intro and socials of other team members or core contributors associated with the organisation?","questionId":3},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"We have been using the Alfajores Testnet to test our contracts and planning on adding CELO network to our supported Chains.

The scarce treasures of the forests. Let's build a new economy backed by these assets proof of being preserved. \n\n\n**Endangered Tokens** is a ReFi dMRV & NFT community looking to revalue biodiversity and **incentivize regeneration** by tokenizing endangered & monumental trees with **web3 preserve&earn incentives** and digital value added with content, technology and **real world impact**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d48BuYn.png)\n\n\n**TLDR: What's new since the Last round (GG20)?**\n\n-EntSnap, the tree verification dapp, on alpha testing stage. Extended until August 31st. More than 100 trees verified and more than 20 users onboarded.\n-Participation on Ethereum Chile 2024, Regenerative Finance talk given.\n-Participation in 2 more community events onboarding users to our dApp\n-$ROOTS Delayed token launch due to improving tokenomics and best token engineering practices. \n-UX/UI improvement of the Entsnap dApp. Still on development. \n-WebApp backoffice for Entsnap Data validation v1.0\n-Webapp for tree tokenization from Entsnap Data in development\n-We are sorry to have suffered the death of a dear friend of our team members, advisor and supporter, Cristobal Ostornol, who drowned on July 17th snorkeling with us, we couldn't save him. This event was devastating to our team and was a setback to our goals of this round. Our sincere apologies to our supporters and we ask for prayers.\n\n\n\n\n**Roadmap for this round (GG21):**\n- Onboard 100+ users to Entsnap Tree dmrv dapp\n- Decentralized tree tokenization web platform Beta from Entsnap Data\n- Launch Entsnap Open Beta \n- Register 500+ trees with Entsnap\n- Launch Ents Wiki to inform about Endangered Trees to focus on registering\n- Improve AI recognition Models for Entsnap verification system\n- ENTS DAO Governance mechanism design\n- ENTS Foundation LLC incorporated in Arizona\n\n\n# Why support us?\n\n*Problem to Solve*\n\n**Endangered trees** are responsible for maintaining the health of most of the world's **endangered forest ecosystems**, but rarely produce relevant revenue for landowners (without being damaged) and even become **financial liabilities**, thus encouraging their ilegal felling. \n\n\n\n*Endangered Tokens’ Solution*\n\n**Leverage web3**, **dMRV** and **digital art** to incentivize the protection of these **scarce** beings by changing their status from merely the cost of maintaining a tree to a **revenue producing Bio-Asset**. Using NFTs ERC-721 we tokenize trees through imaging and georeferencing becoming pioneers in the tokenization of Natural Real World Assets (NRWA)\n\n\n## Missions\n\n1.-To **foster the protection** of endangered trees by bestowing them with **tangible value** in society.\n\n2.-Form a **decentralized** investment community for biodiversity preservation, giving value and governance to stakeholders through **Crypto Assets**.\n## Vision \n\nAs humans we need to **revalue biodiversity** and living ecosystems through the preservation of Endangered Species, which are **invaluable natural assets** to society.\nWe envision a world where endangered and long lived trees are **not only preserved** but also revered for their **intrinsic value**, fostering a harmonious **coexistence** between **nature and society**.\n \n\n---\n### How will we accomplish this?\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/laF4AmK.png) \n\n\n\n\n**Endangered Tokens** is a **ReFi & DeSci NFT** community looking to revalue biodiversity by **tokenizing georeferenced endangered trees**. We are building a **real life impact** coordination game in which users can receive rewards for verifying georreferenced trees with their phones. Each specimen is characterized and photographed alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you **become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree**!\nWith the funds raised we will help landowners finance the **protection of endangered Forest** with **reforestation**, verification of **carbon credits** from the forests and the creation of quality **digital content & data** to add value to the tokens, content like:\n\n* **Georeferenced images and interactive mapping**, Taken through our Entsnap dApp in a decentralized way and available publicly.\n* **Inmersive UX for ReFi Assets**, to engage with web3 enthusiasts and show the value of each token **as seen in real life**.\n* **3D tourism experience** of the protected forests thus **reducing the footprint** of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to **keep supporting the protection of the forests**. \n* Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for **video games** and/or **augmented reality** experiences\n* **Recording data** from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, **bioacoustics**, video recording of the ecosystems, **climate data**, water flow, among other relevant information.\n\n\nNFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to ***biodiversity assets for the future***. \n\nWe are also developing a new type of Credit Class for Old Grown Trees (OGT credit Class) so any type of big tree can become a way of proving your positive impact in the world and a way of financing its protection, instead of cutting them down for wood.\n\n---\n\n### Which kind of trees are we talking about?\n\nWe are currently working in **Chile** in South america, with the rare species [***Gomortega Keule***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. This magnificent beings are the last one of the *Gomortegacae* Family, dating its evolution to ***Pangea*** times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (*Scarcer than Bitcoin!*)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YsQ5Heb.jpg)\n\n\nWith the help of past Gitcoin Grants we are also making contacts and reviewing possible projects with the Brazilian Tree **\"Pau Brasil\" or [Paubrasilia echinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paubrasilia)** an endangered Species of tree from which the country got it's name! The heavily abused lumbering by portuguese conquerors depleted their population and nowadays is a rare and unique living being. \n\nWe are developing a roadmap of species to keep onboarding, like Alerce, Pitao, Araucaria, Baobab, Sequoia, and others. \n\n---\n\n### How will grant funding has been/will be spent?\n\nAs of the date of this 21th round of Gitcoin Grants (#GG21 #letsgrow) we have raised around 38000 DAI through Gitcoin that we have spent cautiously in development and growth and also have some saved for our roadmap goals. Without Gitcoin this project would not be able to keep moving forward as we have. We thank every supporter and every sponsor of the Climate Rounds and the Climate Coordination Network Collective for its amazing work! \n\nThings we have invested until now and will continue to invest: \n\n**1. Project development** (Priority)\n\nDevelop the products, contracts and DAPPs necessary to ensure mission fulfilment, growth and engagement. See ongoing projects for further detail. \n\n\n\n**2. Vital activities core team funding**\n- [x] General administration\n- [x] Coding and development\n- [x] Marketing and community growth\n- [x] NGO's and landowners coordination\n- [x] Content creation and production\n\n\n**3. Endangered Tokens Conservation program**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvRnym7.png)\n* Tokenization, extensive cadastre & landowner agreements\n* in-situ conservation actions to reduce threats. \n* Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions\n* Sustainable local development & community engagement\n* Research on species and their habitats\n* Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement\n\n**4. Marketing and community building**\n\nWe have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team. Among other things, we have attended several Crypto Conferences creating network and alliances with important crypto and ReFi Actors. \n\n\n**5. Decentralization**\n\nOne of the challenges faced has been to improve decentralization within the projects. Part of the funds will go to improve decentralization each round.\n\n**6. Equipment**\n\nIn order to experiment, record, experience and iterate on our products we have invested in technology like the Plantsplay device, HD Camera, Meta Oculus Quest 2 and looking to purchase a 360° action cam for content creation within the forest. \n\n---\n\n## State of the art & ongoing projects\n\nWe have done so far 3 official expeditions to \"El Hual-Hual\" forest in which we are working on. \n\n\n\n**1st Expedition:** GPS geolocation and audiovisual material for tokenization of 25 Adult Queules. Here a seedling Queule picture from that date\n\n![SeedlingLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkw441zx0.png)\n\n\n\n**2nd Expedition**: Visit the forest with ReFi friend from Koywe\n\n![VisitaHual](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkdS8JMgA.png)\n\n\n **3rd Expedition:** Gather more audiovisual material for detail needs in the 3D modelling of the forest\n \n ![Audiovisual expedition LOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkwa6kzxR.png)\n\n\n**4rd Expedition:** Music of the trees through frequency device\n\n\n![ExpedicionMúsicaLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXB3AMgA.png)\n\n![](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/ee54ec3e61f22bc7787c288ea5109c88/Audiovisual_expedition.PNG)\n\n**5th Expedition:** Big & monumental trees at Lago Caro Patagonia\n\nThrough the swamp towards the big forest!\n![Entxpedition Lago caro 4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1vXQM2lA.jpg)\n\nA wild big Koywe Patagónico appears!\n![Entxpedition Lago caro 2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry3BXz3l0.jpg)\n\n\n### *The Tokents*: Digital assets with ReFi purpose (NOT INTENDED AS ADVERTISING ONLY AS SHOWING AS A MILESTONE)\n\n* #### Elder ENTS NFT: Georreferenced tokenized Specimens of Endangered Trees. \n    * 1st Collection Gomortega Keule - Elder ENT Queule# : **Founders Collection** \n  * Premium Asset of the community\n\n  * Georreferenced tokenized Specimens of real life Critically Endangered Trees.\n\n  * Digital property percentage of the 3D assets built around each tree. \n\n\n\n  * Eligible for airdrops and voting power (TBD)\n\n  * Contract verified on the polygon mainnet \n\n  * 25 Queule trees have been tokenized, only 12 Elder Ents Gomortega Keule have been minted.\n \n   [**Opensea Site**](https://opensea.io/collection/elder-ents-gomortega-keule)\n   \n* ## Production and development of the first WEB3 virtual reality touristic *Endangered Forest* experience.\n\nWe have been developing this project for almost a year, but got delayed in the middle for lack of funds and other inconvenients.

With decentralization, smartphones and a well designed DAPP we can connect incentives with tasks on the field to discover, register, content capture, tokenize and give living proof-of-tree for valuable specimen, keeping token holders updated on their collected ENTS aswell as landwoners incetivized to preserve them.\n(GG19)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y0udaZS.png)\n(First Mock-up)\n\n\n(GG20)\n![ENTS DAPP UX.jpg](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkzvC_ump.jpg)\n(First Figma for the V1.0 app in development)\n\n(GG21)\n![EntsDapp UX](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19IsTiKC.png)\n(Current Entsnap UX Figma in development)\n\n\n\n* ### Entrees NFT: (NOT INTENDED AS ADVERTISING ONLY AS SHOWING AS A MILESTONE)\n(Mock-up Only)\n  * 1st Collection CryptoKeules - Entrees CK# : **Artist Diegong** - TBM 9990+10(1/1)s \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jFtN92C.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/29hudch.jpg)\n\n1st Minting December 2022 \n2nd Mint TBA\nThis Pixel Art token will grant you access (hence it is and Entry) to the Alpha Release of the Ecosystem UX in development. The purpose of this be able to grow the community further than only the available tokenized Endangered trees (That are really scarce to produce many!)\n\n\n\n\n\n* ### Old Grown trees Credit Class Development (OGT Credits)\n\nIn order to fully convert our protected trees to biodiversity Assets we thought a way to represent them as credits. The OGT Credits system allows landowners to register their Old Grown Trees through the ENTS DAPP, a user-friendly application. Once registered, these trees transform into 'credits' based on their age and conservation status. Landowners can then monetize these credits, creating a compelling economic reason to preserve these trees.\n\n[OGT Credit class document draft - Comments accepted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InmHe8GEGo0ZsklMu_GqEmaQutDLny6YXvMnzo0LTX8/edit?usp=sharing)\n* #### Ecosystem UX development\n\nFor two years we have been thinking the best way to make interact the Endangered Tokens User with their Endangered trees Collectibles. We believe the User Experience can make a difference in the value of a token. Combining previous developments we are on the road to creating a unique experience.\n\nAs a player of Ecosystem UX, you can collect and plant rare and georeferenced tokenized trees as NFTs, earn rewards, and interact with other players from around the world. These trees are not just any trees; they are rare and endangered species that need our help to survive. By collecting these trees, players contribute to the conservation of these species, learn about their unique characteristics, and help preserve the biodiversity of our planet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P4OJ0lj.jpg)\n(Mock-up Only)\n\n\n\n\n ### Fungible Tokens TBD\n\n* ### $ENTS DAO Governance Token - Fungible ERC20 to vote in DAO discussions and other ReFi/DeFi applications- TBA\n\n* ### $ROOTS utility Token - Fungible ERC20 to use within dapp functions and utilities. This Token will be the rewards & payment token within the ENTS DAPP.\n\n # Projects in development\n \n## Ecosystem treasures: HD Forest native species content (TBA)\n\n\nOther type of collectible to learn about local ecosystems and can be used to enhance your experience within our upcoming platform. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ☸️🌳🌳🌳The Queule 3D virtual Experience🌳🌳🌳\n\nUsing Unreal Engine 5 we have modeled so far 10 of the 25 tokenized Queules.

The scarce treasures of the forests. Let's build a new economy backed by these assets proof of being preserved. \n\n\n**Endangered Tokens** is a ReFi dMRV & NFT community looking to revalue biodiversity and **incentivize regeneration** by tokenizing endangered & monumental trees with **web3 preserve&earn incentives** and digital value added with content, technology and **real world impact**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d48BuYn.png)\n\n\n### **Location Based Impact:** \nWe are making impact in five specific locations within 2 regions of Chile in a direct way:\n- **El Hual-Hual Forest:** A private conservation area located in the coastal side of Ñuble Region in Chile. We have tokenized 25 Queules and helped the landowner finance its conservation efforts. \n- **Los Maquis regeneration center:**  Its landowner is looking to regenerate land used for industrial wood harvesting and residential plots. We have planted over 10 Queules plus removed foreign species to let the native forest grow. This round we looking to expand this impact.\n- **Alto el Molino private conservation Área:** We are working together with \"Los Peumos SpA. \" to incentivize the protection of a native forest located within a land destined to be plotted for residential use. We looking to protect more than 10000 square meters of land and include Queules and Pitaos as Endangered Species to be positioned within the reserve. \n- **Quebrada Cerrillos:** A private conservation reserve in which we have conversations to start a Endangered Species planting among the different landowners that hold the governance of the reserve. \n- **Escuela Chucao:** A private rural School located in the \"Los Lagos\" Region in southern Chile, in the middle of the habitat of the Alerce tree (fitzroya Cuprezoides). We Will have a Alerce nursery  run by students, and will teach students about the importance of endangered trees to protect endangered habitats. \n\nOther locations to integrate: \nWe are looking to decentralize the process of onboarding locations to our platform so more landowners can benefit from endangered trees as biodiversity assets. Hopefully with this method scale our location impact model towards a decentralized impact model. \n___\n\n**TLDR: What's new since the Last round (RWBGG21)?**\n\n- EntSnap, the tree verification dapp, on Open Beta stage.  \n- WebApp backoffice for Entsnap Data validation v1.0\n- Webapp for tree tokenization from Entsnap Data in development\n- Five location based agreements to register/plant new endangered trees in 2024/2025\n\n\n\n**Roadmap for this round (MA earth GG22):**\n- Entsnap Open Beta ongoing. \n- UX new features proposal for Entsnap\n- 4 Activities with \"Escuela Chucao\" community regarding Alerce tree (Fitzroya Cuprezoides) in Puerto Varas.\n- Planting activity at Centro Los Maquis\n- Queule Nursery support at El Hual-Hual\n\n\n# Why support us?\n\n*Problem to Solve*\n\n**Endangered trees** are responsible for maintaining the health of most of the world's **endangered forest ecosystems**, but rarely produce relevant revenue for landowners (without being damaged) and even become **financial liabilities**, thus encouraging their ilegal felling. \n\n\n\n*Endangered Tokens’ Solution*\n\n**Leverage web3**, **dMRV** to incentivize the protection of these **scarce** beings by changing their status from merely the cost of maintaining a tree to a **revenue producing Bio-Asset**. Using NFTs ERC-721 we tokenize trees through imaging and georeferencing becoming pioneers in the tokenization of Natural Real World Assets (NRWA)\n\n\n## Missions\n\n1.-To **foster the protection** of endangered trees by bestowing them with **tangible value** in society.\n\n2.-Form a **decentralized** investment community for biodiversity preservation, giving value and governance to stakeholders through **Crypto Assets**.\n## Vision \n\nAs humans we need to **revalue biodiversity** and living ecosystems through the preservation of Endangered Species, which are **invaluable natural assets** to society.\nWe envision a world where endangered and long lived trees are **not only preserved** but also revered for their **intrinsic value**, fostering a harmonious **coexistence** between **nature and society**.\n \n\n---\n### How will we accomplish this?\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/laF4AmK.png) \n\n\n\n\n**Endangered Tokens** is a **ReFi & DeSci NFT** community looking to revalue biodiversity by **tokenizing georeferenced endangered trees**. We are building a **real life impact** coordination game in which users can receive rewards for verifying georreferenced trees with their phones. Each specimen is characterized and photographed alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you **become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree**!\nWith the funds raised we will help landowners and communities finance the **protection of endangered Forest** with **reforestation**, verification of **carbon credits** from the forests and the creation of quality **digital content & data** to add value to the tokens, among our activities within a territory we do:\n* **Location based community activities**, engaging local communities to learn about Endangered Species and to register, verify and plant trees in a decentralized way. \n* **Georeferenced images and interactive mapping**, Taken through our Entsnap dApp in a decentralized way and available publicly.\n* **Inmersive UX for ReFi Assets**, to engage with web3 enthusiasts and show the value of each token **as seen in real life**.\n* **3D tourism experience** of the protected forests thus **reducing the footprint** of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to **keep supporting the protection of the forests**. \n* Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for **video games** and/or **augmented reality** experiences\n* **Recording data** from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, **bioacoustics**, video recording of the ecosystems, **climate data**, water flow, among other relevant information.\n\n\n\n\nNFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to ***biodiversity assets for the future***. \n\nWe are also developing a new type of Credit Class for Old Grown Trees (OGT credit Class) so any type of big tree can become a way of proving your positive impact in the world and a way of financing its protection, instead of cutting them down for wood.\n\n---\n\n### Which kind of trees are we talking about?\n\nEndangered and Critically endangered trees, among other classificiations, are the ones that has 10000 specimens alive or less. You can check all endangered species on the [IUCN Redlist ](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)\n\nWe are currently working in **Chile** in South america, with the rare species [***Gomortega Keule***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. This magnificent beings are the last one of the *Gomortegacae* Family, dating its evolution to ***Pangea*** times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (*Scarcer than Bitcoin!*)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YsQ5Heb.jpg)\n\n\nWith the help of past Gitcoin Grants we are also making contacts and reviewing possible projects with the Brazilian Tree **\"Pau Brasil\" or [Paubrasilia echinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paubrasilia)** an endangered Species of tree from which the country got it's name! The heavily abused lumbering by portuguese conquerors depleted their population and nowadays is a rare and unique living being. \n\nYou can check more species we are going to work with here: https://www.endangeredtokens.org/entswiki \n\n---\n\n### How will grant funding has been/will be spent?\n\nAs of the date of this 22th round of Gitcoin Grants (#GG21 #letsgrow) we have raised around 40000 DAI through Gitcoin that we have spent cautiously in development and growth and also have some saved for our roadmap goals. Without Gitcoin this project would not be able to keep moving forward as we have. We thank every supporter and every sponsor of the Climate Rounds, real world builders, Ma Earth and the Climate Coordination Network Collective for its amazing work! \n\nThings we have invested until now and will continue to invest: \n\n**1. Project development** \n\nDevelop the products, contracts and DAPPs necessary to ensure mission fulfilment, growth and engagement. See ongoing projects for further detail. \n\n\n\n**2. Vital activities core team funding**\n- [x] General administration\n- [x] Coding and development\n- [x] Marketing and community growth\n- [x] NGO's and landowners coordination\n- [x] Content creation and production\n\n\n**3. Endangered Tokens Conservation program** for location based activities\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvRnym7.png)\n* Tokenization, extensive cadastre & landowner agreements\n* in-situ conservation actions to reduce threats. \n* Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions\n* Sustainable local development & community engagement\n* Research on species and their habitats\n* Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement\n\n**4. Marketing and community building**\n\nWe have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team. Among other things, we have attended several Crypto Conferences creating network and alliances with important crypto and ReFi Actors. \n\n\n**5. Decentralization**\n\nOne of the challenges faced has been to improve decentralization within the projects. Part of the funds will go to improve decentralization each round.\n\n**6. Equipment**\n\nIn order to experiment, record, experience and iterate on our products we have invested in technology like the Plantsplay device, HD Camera, Meta Oculus Quest 2 and looking to purchase a 360° action cam for content creation within the forest. \n\n---\n\n## State of the art & ongoing projects\n\nWe have done so far 3 official expeditions to \"El Hual-Hual\" forest in which we are working on. \n\n\n\n**1st Expedition:** GPS geolocation and audiovisual material for tokenization of 25 Adult Queules. Here a seedling Queule picture from that date\n\n![SeedlingLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkw441zx0.png)\n\n\n\n**2nd Expedition**: Visit the forest with ReFi friend from Koywe\n\n![VisitaHual](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkdS8JMgA.png)\n\n\n **3rd Expedition:** Gather more audiovisual material for detail needs in the 3D modelling of the forest\n \n ![Audiovisual expedition LOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkwa6kzxR.png)\n\n\n**4rd Expedition:** Music of the trees through frequency device\n\n\n![ExpedicionMúsicaLOW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXB3AMgA.png)\n\n\n\n**5th Expedition:** Big & monumental trees at Lago Caro Patagonia\n\nThrough the swamp towards the big forest!\n![Entxpedition Lago caro 4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1vXQM2lA.jpg)\n\nA wild big Koywe Patagónico appears!\n![Entxpedition Lago caro 2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry3BXz3l0.jpg)\n\n\n### *The Tokents*: Digital assets with ReFi purpose (NOT INTENDED AS ADVERTISING ONLY AS SHOWING AS A MILESTONE)\n\n* #### Elder ENTS NFT: Georreferenced tokenized Specimens of Endangered Trees. \n    * 1st Collection Gomortega Keule - Elder ENT Queule# : **Founders Collection** \n  * Premium Asset of the community\n\n  * Georreferenced tokenized Specimens of real life Critically Endangered Trees.\n\n  * Digital property percentage of the 3D assets built around each tree. \n\n\n\n  * Eligible for airdrops and voting power (TBD)\n\n  * Contract verified on the polygon mainnet \n\n  * 25 Queule trees have been tokenized, only 12 Elder Ents Gomortega Keule have been minted.\n \n   [**Opensea Site**](https://opensea.io/collection/elder-ents-gomortega-keule)\n   \n* ## Production and development of the first WEB3 virtual reality touristic *Endangered Forest* experience.\n\nWe have been developing this project for almost a year, but got delayed in the middle for lack of funds and other inconvenients. We expect to have the first MVP by september available to be experienced in Meta Oculus Quest 2 or similar. \n\n*First mock-up video of one of the 3d model replicas of the tokenized trees.*\n{%youtube A2Je4vC5g50 %}\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X25AXwr.png)\n\n[Youtube video link](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Je4vC5g50)\n\n*Advanced 3D model in Unreal Engine 5 of 10 of the 25 tokenized trees.*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bitYCOj.png)\n\n(Check it [Here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/elder-ent-queule4-replica-0a6e222a40a0413d97bb58aff7ec47cd) as a 3D model)\n(Check [Here](https://sketchfab.com/endangeredtokens/collections/elder-ent-gomortega-keule-replicas-e036fd4082ab412a90251c00c6a513d9) the rest of the models made) \n   \n\n   \n   * ###  ENTS DAPP: Decentralized Proof-of-Tree registering & incentives DAPP & Public Registry Map for Endangered Trees and ecosistemic services\n\nOne of the challenges we've faced on our journey is to keep updated on-chain data to verify an Endangered tree is actually alive. With decentralization, smartphones and a well designed DAPP we can connect incentives with tasks on the field to discover, register, content capture, tokenize and give living proof-of-tree for valuable specimen, keeping token holders updated on their collected ENTS aswell as landwoners incetivized to preserve them.\n(GG19)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y0udaZS.png)\n(First Mock-up)\n\n\n\n![ENTS DAPP UX.jpg](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkzvC_ump.jpg)\n(First Figma for the V1.0 app in development)\n\n(GG22)\n![EntsDapp UX](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19IsTiKC.png)\n\n\nIf you want to access our open beta click here: \n\nAndroid Users: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entsnap.app\n\nIphone Users: https://testflight.apple.com/join/pz1MOEgm\n\n\n ### Fungible Tokens TBD\n\n* #### $ENTS DAO Governance Token - Fungible ERC20 to vote in DAO discussions and other ReFi/DeFi applications- TBA\n\n* #### $ROOTS utility Token - Fungible ERC20 to use within dapp functions and utilities.

Focus Areas\n\n### **4.1. Social & Solidarity Economy (ESS)**\n\nThe Social & Solidarity Economy (ESS) focuses on creating economic systems that prioritize social well-being, holistic sustainability and solidarity over profit maximization. It includes cooperatives, social enterprises, and community-based organizations that operate on principles of mutual aid, democratic decision-making, and social justice. In Barcelona, ESS is vital for fostering a resilient and inclusive local economy that supports sustainable development and social cohesion.\n\n**Specific Goals/Objectives:**\n\n- Constitute ReFi BCN as a workers cooperative, to be fully nested in the economic ecosystems we want to influence.\n- Establish a diverse set of connections with local and bioregional networks, with the aim of becoming a regenerative super node.\n- Act as a bridge between the Social & Solidarity Economy and the ReFi movement.\n\n**Challenges/Barriers:**\n\n- The majority of ESS actors are hostile toward crypto, mostly for good reasons.\n- ESS is made of socio-economic networks with high density of trust, which is why they are so precious and a model to follow, but this also makes them more demanding in term of bridging work.\n- Politically active worlds as ESS involve an extra layer of complexity to be managed, in comparison with less politics-oriented spaces.\n\n**Target Populations/Stakeholders:**\n\n- Local cooperatives and social enterprises, credit unions, cooperatives of cooperatives.\n- Community organizations and local food networks.\n- Residents of Barcelona and the surrounding region.\n\n**Core Partnerships/Potential Collaborations:**\n\n- [Xarxa d'Economia Solidària (XES)](https://xes.cat/): network promoting solidarity economy in Catalonia.\n- [Coòpolis - Ateneu Cooperatiu de Barcelona](https://www.bcn.coop/): Barcelona hub of the (XES), its primary focus is on fostering new cooperatives and creating job opportunities within existing ones.\n- [Resilience.Earth](https://resilience.earth/): non-profit cooperative focused on enhancing community resilience and regenerative design as pivotal instruments for socio-ecological transformation.\n- [Holon](https://holon.cat/): cooperative agency that designs products, services, policies, and futures for ecosocial transitions.\n- [Bloc4](https://bloc4.coop/): cooperative space that houses Coòpolis and its supported early-stage cooperatives, among others.\n\n### **4.2. Regenerative Land Work & Stewardship**\n\nRegenerative land work and stewardship aim to restore and enhance the health of ecosystems through regenerative agricultural practices, community engagement, and ecological design. This focus area is crucial for maintaining biodiversity, improving soil health, and promoting livelihoods in rural areas. We would like to move the discussion around the “sustainability” framework: sustainability is not enough, we need (ecosocial) regeneration!\n\n**Specific Goals/Objectives:**\n\n- Provide material benefits, support, and mentorship to groups involved in regenerative land work.\n- Fundraise and offer Gitcoin support to sustain these initiatives.\n- Prioritizing the building of trust over anything else, especially over revenues generation. The second should never put the first at risk.\n\n**Challenges/Barriers:**\n\n- Limited access to funding and resources for small-scale regenerative projects.\n- Need for knowledge transfer and capacity building.\n- Balancing ecological goals with the generation of meaningful revenues.\n\n**Target Populations/Stakeholders:**\n\n- Regenerative farmers and land stewards, expert communities.\n- Rural communities in Barcelona and surrounding areas.\n- Environmental and agricultural organizations and movements\n\n**Core Partnerships/Potential Collaborations:**\n\n- [Fundació Emprius](https://emprius.cat/): Focuses on communal culture and sustainable rural development.\n- [Mas la Sala](https://www.maslasala.org/): A cooperative promoting ecosystem regeneration and sustainable agriculture.\n- [Mas Les Vinyes](https://www.maslesvinyes.com/): A permaculture farm committed to sustainable food production and water conservation.\n- [Can Masdeu](https://canmasdeu.net/): A community cooperation space rooted in Collserola, with regenerative land work.\n- [Arran de Terra](https://arrandeterra.org/): Promotes just and sustainable food systems through Agroecology and Food Sovereignty, supporting local ecological production and social cohesion.\n\n### **4.3. Local Food Systems**\n\nLocal food systems emphasize local, community-based food production and distribution networks. They aim to provide healthy, fair, and environmentally-friendly food options, while supporting local farmers and reducing the carbon footprint of food consumption.\n\n**Specific Goals/Objectives:**\n\n- Engage with stakeholders to understand and improve local food systems.\n- Promote the relevance of regenerative farmers and land stewards in the local food value chain.\n- Raise awareness about the problems of green capitalism and techno-solutionism in food systems.\n\n**Challenges/Barriers:**\n\n- Navigating the significant complexities of local food networks and market dynamics.\n- Overcoming resistance to non-regenerative approaches from certain stakeholders.\n- Facing the very entrenched and damaging power structures which constitutes the not-regenerative status quo.\n\n**Target Populations/Stakeholders:**\n\n- Local farmers and food producers.\n- Consumers seeking better and fairer food options.\n- Community organizations and food cooperatives.\n\n**Core Partnerships/Potential Collaborations:**\n\n- [Foodcoop BCN](https://foodcoopbcn.cat/): A cooperative supermarket promoting sustainable and fair products.\n- [LaCoordi](https://lacoordi.cat/): Facilitates projects for global justice and sustainable economic models.\n- [Opcions](https://opcions.coop/): Encourages conscious consumption aligned with sustainability and social justice values.\n\n### **4.4. Events & Pluralities of Education**\n\nReFi Barcelona events and polyvocal education initiatives aim to raise awareness, build capacity, and foster a community around regenerative finance and related fields. These activities are crucial for spreading knowledge, encouraging participation, and driving the adoption of regenerative financial practices, with an attention to the social and cultural complexities of the specific context. We aim to disseminate the concept of regenerative finance in more conventional educational and financial settings, such as universities, governmental institutions, and community spaces. \n\n**Specific Goals/Objectives:**\n\n- Connect with cooperative and innovation hubs, as ImpactHub and Bloc44.\n- Organize and participate in events to promote ReFi concepts and practices.\n- Develop a plurality of educational programs (form, content, goal wise) to enhance understanding of ReFi among a variety of stakeholders.\n\n**Challenges/Barriers:**\n\n- Ensuring sufficient attendance and engagement at events, and growing the community with the proper pace - not too fast, not too slow.\n- Balancing “theoretical” and ethical education with “practical” dimensions and present strategies.\n- Achieving a balance between too much and too little socio-cultural variety, as both scenarios bring problems.\n\n**Target Populations/Stakeholders:**\n\n- Entrepreneurs and startups in the fintech and sustainability sectors.\n- Community spaces and networks interested in alternative finance.\n- Educational institutions and non-formal education actors.\n\n**Core Partnerships/Potential Collaborations:**\n\n- Akasha Hub\n- ESADE and ELISAVA Universities\n- Impact Hub\n\n## 5.

These pillars guide our activities and shape our approach to supporting the ecosocial transition.\n\nOur strategic lines are designed as a progression, from building awareness to enabling action:\n\n1. **📚 Knowledge, Research & Education** — *From unawareness to understanding*\n    \n    We develop open knowledge and its repositories, materials, and practical guides that make regenerative concepts accessible to diverse audiences, with special attention to connecting global ReFi innovations with local contexts and needs, and vice versa.\n    \n    - [ReFi BCN Knowledge Base](https://refibcn.cat/Ecosystem+Map/Ecosystem+Map)\n\n2. **👥 Community & Network** — *From understanding to collaboration*\n    \n    We organize events and spaces for connection, dialogue, and mutual learning between local and global actors.\n    \n    - ReFi Unconference Barcelona ‘24\n    - BioFi Barcelona ‘25\n\n3. **♻️ Financial Resources** — *From collaboration to supporting tangible impact*\n    \n    We aim to help local projects access regenerative funding through Web3 platforms and ethical banking in the Social & Solidarity economy, exploring how to create hybrid financial structures to support the much-needed regenerative work on the ground.\n    \n    - Piloting with the ReFi Mediterranean GG23 round\n\n4. **⚖️ Governance & Innovation** — *From consolidation to systemic transformation (future)*\n    \n    On the horizon, we’d like to promote governance approaches that combine cooperative principles with DAOs, exploring different models to fund and develop local communities—such as democratic decision-making, established financial flows, quadratic funding, community currencies, and more. This pillar will activate in a future phase as the network strengthens.\n    \n\n---\n\n# 2.

By organizing tree-planting events and raising climate change awareness, **we aim to restore ecosystems and support biodiversity**.\n\n**Why?** Deforestation in Nigeria, driven by logging and agriculture, has led to the **loss of 96% of its primary forests**. This has exacerbated climate change impacts, including biodiversity loss and severe coastal erosion in coastal communities. Addressing this issue is crucial for environmental sustainability and community well-being and we are passionate about solving this problem \n\n**Where?** Our project focuses on rural and urban communities in Nigeria, particularly coastal areas such as Lagos and the Niger Delta region.

Celo’s mission of financial inclusion and sustainability aligns perfectly with our goals of regenerative entrepreneurship and community empowerment in Los Altos Mirandinos. Here’s how we’ve been utilizing and plan to further align with the Celo ecosystem:\n\nCurrent Utilization of the Celo Ecosystem\nOnboarding and Education through Celo’s Platform:\n\nWe've been using Celo’s blockchain as the foundational layer for our onboarding events and educational initiatives. During events like the “Ruta del Café,” we introduce local farmers and entrepreneurs to Celo's blockchain technology, demonstrating how it can be used for sustainable practices and financial inclusion.\n\nBy leveraging Celo’s user-friendly mobile-first approach, we've made it easier for community members to understand and adopt blockchain technology, which is crucial for areas with limited access to traditional financial services.\n\nDevelopment of Governance Structures with Celo’s Tools:\n\nWe are in the process of creating a governance token using Celo's blockchain to facilitate decentralized decision-making within our community. This token will empower community members, giving them a stake in the project’s future and encouraging active participation in governance.\n\nThis aligns with Celo’s ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), where financial tools are built to be inclusive and accessible to everyone, particularly underserved populations.\n\nCollaboration and Networking:\n\nWe have been utilizing Celo’s network to establish connections with global partners and experts. By aligning with the Regen Coordi-Nation initiative, which is closely connected to the Celo ecosystem, we are able to tap into a broader community of like-minded projects, enhancing our impact and reach.\n\nRoadmap for Future Alignment with Celo\nIntegrating DeFi Solutions:\n\nWe plan to explore and integrate Celo’s DeFi solutions to provide microloans and financial services to local farmers and entrepreneurs. \n\nThese microloans, facilitated by Celo’s stablecoins (cUSD and cEUR), will provide much-needed financial liquidity to support regenerative practices and sustainable business models.\n\nBy utilizing Celo’s stablecoins, we ensure that these financial services are accessible, stable, and reliable, even in an environment like Venezuela, which is often plagued by hyperinflation and economic instability.\n\nScaling Educational Programs with Celo’s Ecosystem:\n\nWe aim to scale our educational programs by developing a series of workshops and online courses on regenerative finance (ReFi) and blockchain technology, powered by Celo. These programs will be made accessible not only to local communities but also to a broader audience in Latin America.\n\nOur goal is to create a replicable model that can be adopted by other communities interested in leveraging Celo’s ecosystem for sustainable development.\n\nExpansion of Governance Token Use:\n\nMoving forward, we plan to expand the use of our governance token, built on Celo, to include broader community participation. \n\nThis will involve creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that empowers farmers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders in Los Altos Mirandinos to propose and vote on key initiatives.\n\nThe governance token will also be used to reward community contributions, further incentivizing sustainable practices and participation in the ReFi Venezuela Node.\n\nStrengthening Global Connections:\n\nThrough ongoing participation in Celo’s global initiatives, we plan to deepen our connections with international partners, thereby attracting more resources, expertise, and visibility to our projects in Venezuela.\n\nThis alignment will not only enhance our local impact but will also contribute to Celo’s vision of building a global financial system that creates conditions for prosperity for all.","hidden":false,"question":"If applicable, describe how your project/community has been utilising or supporting the Celo ecosystem, or explain a roadmap for your plans to utilise, build with, or align with Celo.","questionId":4},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you (or other key members of your team) joined the Regen Coordi-Nation Community Telegram group? --> https://t.me/+dfOMYhMROdU5YzY0","questionId":5},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you followed @RegenCoordinate on X (Twitter)? --> https://x.com/RegenCoordinate","questionId":6}],"project":{"id":"0xca9ca5422ea5f4a776c404f8dbeeb9c492489ec79e55d679b4b2047a558c1fca","title":"The farming governance of ReFi and Coffee","logoImg":"bafkreibkpg4qi4ltag6h3lqt4kl6udmyy3segcdjputmaqlyunvpttea5e","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreifgbaujk3rnty25lxfs7dxy3x4zcgavjcl26lsswjtxkovtczozbi","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://refivenezuela.org","bannerImg":"bafybeibz27vkffflgorlpdscni6bfj3mp6tjlexniebb4cq3s7x6xqdy6a","createdAt":1723369093874,"credentials":{},"description":"# Summary\n\n**The ReFi Venezuela Node** is at the forefront of advancing regenerative entrepreneurship in Los Altos Mirandinos, leveraging blockchain technology to empower local communities. Building on our previous successes, including the **ReFi Bootcamp** and our recent **\"Ruta del Café\"** event, we are expanding our community to encompass a broader range of ventures beyond farming. This expansion includes collaborating with **STEAM Venezuela** to foster educational and entrepreneurial activities and social impact-driven initiatives.\n\nOur ongoing efforts include regular onboarding events that introduce participants to blockchain and sustainability concepts, further strengthened by the involvement of **Twist Studio Creativo**. Twist Studio acts as a catalyst for innovation, guiding community members through the transition to regenerative practices. By engaging diverse industries and promoting gender equality, we are creating a vibrant ecosystem of sustainable entrepreneurship, social impact, and circular economy projects.\n\nWe aim to develop a governance token to further integrate our growing community into the Web3 space, facilitating decentralized collaboration and global connections. Through these initiatives, we strive to transform Los Altos Mirandinos into a hub of regenerative activity, bridging the gap between traditional practices and modern technological solutions.\n\n---\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nVenezuela faces significant socio-economic and environmental challenges, including hyperinflation, unequal access to resources, and unsustainable farming practices. In Los Altos Mirandinos, coffee farmers struggle to maintain traditional farming methods amid these conditions. Migration, high poverty levels, and restrictive government controls have led to the erosion of social fabric and a scarcity of innovative resources. Many communities experience a pressing need for economic independence, as well as access to information and knowledge.

Mini Pay.\n- Attracting new developers who will play a role in building new dApps on Celo and participating in the development of existing dApps and developing payment solutions.\n- Attracting new artists who will play a role in creating NFTs on the Celo network.\n- Attracting investors and establishing partnerships, which will play a role in strengthening Celo’s position in the Middle

More funds are needed for regenerative activities, especially those more critical in the Bay Area. We are focused on substantially increasing these funds.\n\n\n**Context** \n\nStrong forces make the Bay Area a unique and wealthy place. From natural beauty, activism, and art, to hi-tech and world-influence. These forces have mutated into some regrettable outcomes, such as vast suburban sprawls, homelessness, heavy drug use; soil depletion and deforestation, and an overall void in culture and increasing inequality. These contrasts can be turned into symbiotic success.\n\nBy blending a wholistic approach with the current capitalistic system to mobilize resources and strategically allocate them in the fertile soils of regeneration; We are determined to grow capital and contribute to the transition to \"the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible\", at the speed this area and the world needs.\n\nAn anecdote from an event we participated in collaboration with the Street Outreach DAO: “We invited homeless people to join us in the park where we cooked and served pancakes. Some pulled their instruments and livened up the environment with music while one of them showed us Tai Chi. When I said goodbye to an older gentleman I invited, who was having a terrible time sleeping in the street; He made sure I looked into his eyes while he firmly shook my hand, so he could show me how much he appreciated our gesture. It was a great feeling to know that somehow we had given him hope too. \" We are currently seeking housing for him.\n\nThis is one of the types of regeneration we want to focus on. The actions required to tackle these complex problems, such as affordable housing, ending homelessness, and regenerative sustainability for the suburban sprawl affecting the environment, require large investments and high levels of expertise.\n\n\n**Solution**\n\nWe aim to exponentially increase regenerative funding by incubating high-profit margin entities that commit a percentage of their profits to regeneration; Leveraging web3, AI, tokenomics, and incentivizing the community.\n\n\n**Project**\n\nWe are raising funds to embark on a 2-month “Impact Business Campaign” in which our core team, experts in sales, branding, and operations, works to close 10 big-ticket deals in sustainable real estate development, solar energy, regenerative architectural and engineering design. The average commission of these deals is approximately $10,000, which will result in $100,000 in revenue. 20% of the revenue from this Impact Business Campaign, which is $20,000, will be donated toward regenerative activities, consequent campaigns, and funding rounds; Continuously compounding investments into regenerative projects and activities.\n\nEach Campaign culminates with the “Regenerative Treaties”, where the deals will be presented to the public. This event will help the deals gain publicity and exposure and, at the same time, serve as an opportunity to call for regenerative projects and talents to participate in future Campaigns.\n\n\n**Journey**\n\nBeing actively involved in the ReFi space in the Bay area Sunny and Al met in several events such as Funding the Commons/Earth Commons in Berkeley which led to wanting to work together in contributing to the growth of regeneration of the environment, including human society. Camille and Martin, exploring opportunities to make an impact with tech, discovered Al’s idea of creating a reward system to fund regenerative activities. Together, the core team aligned with Refi DAO’s vision of leveraging Web3 technology to address local needs and create real-world impact, and created ReFi BayArea to structure and grow the envisioned reward system.\n\n\n**Key milestone**\n\nAgreement to incubate Atmosphereum, a web3 regenerative impact business network marketplace.\n\n\n**Challenges and opportunities**\n\n* Challenges: The social and environmental needs of the Bay Area are complex and require huge investments.\n\n* Opportunities: The San Francisco Bay Area is known for incubating technology innovations with the most concentrated funding resources and talents. We aim to utilize this wealth of resources and network to build up ReFi Bay Area, making it the epicenter for funding projects that regenerate and sustain our world.\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"ReFiBayArea"},"recipient":"0x4E3FA88B8422e61667B0CF254847fB670ACF407B"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreic4hhlgr53vundf2knij6mgfqdlipfecquhrwcw6jmohqit4jko5a","projects":[{"name":"ReFi BayArea","id":"0xa0e295c0ace46f13ba9024a0749293014c19d27f25125477a5946e42b06c94da","metadata":{"title":"ReFi BayArea","logoImg":"bafkreienmu5qexxy6svvun7gn6dswntwob42shw4vtpjgbimvberoideiu","website":"https://www.refibayarea.com/","bannerImg":"bafkreibjm7ucfm4j4azfl2d2a6orn5jkdwxtkrv4o3zbuux6oqbchg57ha","createdAt":1723362138939,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-04-01T12:08:02.598Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0xacf97e570ff326f2291b69c118d3b24ae406bedd7032ba973d0312748c1d81307660b4843d7cade068714edc337d7b460760a98afb5fc66d48892147b0dc4ce91c","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-04-01T12:08:02.598Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-30T12:08:02.598Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x4E3FA88B8422e61667B0CF254847fB670ACF407B","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#ReFiBayArea","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:v+YdAavMt1vkmd0aYZe9UypdY4LgkSjP9r8Z5gkEczQ="]}}},"description":"# ✨ ReFi BayArea — Portal to the Age of Enchantment ✨  \n## *Regenerative Alchemy in Action, Starting from the Bay Area*\n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Mission  \nReFi BayArea catalyzes transformative regeneration by weaving real estate, technology, and community into powerful regenerative ecosystems — reviving forgotten places and inspiring people to thrive.\n\n ![Visual suggestion: Concept art of Frontier Tower with lush facade, food forests, and the Opal Eye glowing at the top](https://i.imgur.com/NI1EZQM.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Our Regenerative Journey  \nIn the past year, we’ve activated practical solutions that are already transforming reality — grounded actions infused with transcendent visions:\n\n### 🌐 Atmosphere Marketplace: Making Regeneration Investable  \nLaunched **Atmosphere**, the first blockchain-based marketplace designed specifically for regenerative real estate, solar, and design projects — so far generated over **$8,000** in regenerative sales this year.\n\n ![Mockups showcasing real regenerative deals](https://i.imgur.com/yccnd7B.png)\n ![Mockups showcasing real regenerative deals](https://i.imgur.com/ScKnUTg.png)\n ![Mockups showcasing real regenerative deals](https://i.imgur.com/kgsRKsn.png)\n---\n\n### 🌿 Urban Hub Farms: Scaling Urban Regeneration  \nEvolved Urban House Farms into the visionary Urban Hub Farms, successfully supporting them to raise over $5,000 in MaEarth’s Gitcoin round — establishing a replicable model for global, culturally-connected regenerative agriculture, and pioneering the evolution of cities into enchanted, transcendent food forests — blending automation, ecology, and human spirit.\n\n ![Artistic rendering: lush urban farm embedded in a thriving city environment](https://i.imgur.com/bIE3wdo.png)\n\n---\n\n### 🏘️ Regenerative Design with Ecoterium: Ending Homelessness with Beauty  \nPartnered with **Ecoterium** and supported **Interim Housing DAO** by delivering inspired regenerative designs for emergency housing — advancing their mission to end homelessness.

By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for climate and socio-economic upheaval. Our infrastructure for waste regeneration enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. \n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nWe are also building governance frameworks for marginalized communities that will also be used in preserving these resources transparently as well as enable them to receive alternative means to financing.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3 through alternative financing: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants and receive impact certificates.

By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for climate and socio-economic upheaval. Our infrastructure for waste regeneration enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. \n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nWe are also building governance frameworks for marginalized communities that will also be used in preserving these resources transparently as well as enable them to receive alternative means to financing.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3 through alternative financing: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants and receive impact certificates.

This collection is emblematic of how our collective vision can transcend traditional boundaries, merging art, technology, and environmental stewardship. Each NFT not only represents a unique piece of art but also serves as a digital beacon for ReFi Tulum, with proceeds supporting our ongoing projects and community initiatives.\nThis initiative is a powerful way for ReFi Tulum to support female artists, providing them with a platform to showcase their talents and achieve financial returns from their art. With 70% of sales going to each artist and 30% going to ReFi Tulum, we feel this is beautiful and regenerative way to support both the arts as well as our local ReFi Initiatives, directly benefiting Tulum's environment and community.\nWe are thankful to the Celo team for their dedication to ReFi,  the arts and for supporting female artists. We are excited for this incredible milestone, and opportunity to use the power of creativity to drive meaningful change and foster a regenerative future for Tulum and beyond.\n![Fierce Feminine of RefiBannersm](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJhTmZeqA.jpg)\n\n\nWe also used some of the funds to start the modification work on our TF100 but unfortunately have run into issues with our worker going MIA after starting the work.

These ebikes will be part of our regenerative tourism experiences and activations.\n![ebikes](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJH7SNRYR.png)\n\n\n\n2)We are working to find a new worker to finish our tf100 updates. It has been frustrating that our previous worker started the modifications and has left us high and dry. We are actively looking for another skilled worker to take on the modifications. \n\n3) We have contributed to the shipping costs of bringing Robotina, a small demo plant of Petgas to bring to Tulum.We are working with Petgas to bring a small demo plant to Tulum. We have been cleaning the area where the plant will go and getting it ready to set up. The plant, affectionately called Robotina, will be able to process 90 kilos of plastic every time it runs and transform it into fuels. The purpose of having this plant here is to demonstrate the technology and the full circularity of our plastic sequestration model.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate ReFi Tulum's commitment to addressing the climate crisis through practical and impactful solutions.\n![gg21 robotina](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJrbfNRt0.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Update on Project Progress and Impact:**\nTL;DR: \nWe have been making significant progress towards a regenerative future for Tulum with the launch of ReFi Rides, plastic credits, and strengthening our strategic partnerships with organizations like Tulum Circula and Day Zero. Both of these initiatives have an impact on Climate and are actively reducing environmental GHGs by eliminating plastic deterioration in nature and landfills as well as developing more sustainable transportation options with minimal to zero emissions.\n\n\nAdditionally we are promoting and advancing new economic systems  through continued community clean-up efforts rewarded with tokens that can be used for products, services and events. We are excited to be putting into play the proof points for the new economic system of the future -  leveraging technology, community activations and environmental responsibility to pave the path to a regenerative future for Tulum.\n\n\n **Focus Areas:** \n  - **Plastic Neutrality and RWA (Real World Asset) eMobility:** \nOur primary focus has been on our plastic neutrality initiatives and ReFi Rides, our eMotorbike NFT RWA fleet that blends digital ownership with eco-friendly transportation. We remain convinced of the importance and value of regenerative tourism for Tulum. However, as a small team coming into the low (summer) season for Tulum tourism, we have decided to lessen our focus on developing regenerative tourism experiences. However, we will continue to engage with inbound interest that comes our way for these types of regenerative experiences. We also see that ReFi Rides will also have an exciting role to play in building out our regenerative tourism options in the future.\n![ecosystem gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy7HAUngR.png)\n\n\n  \n- **Collaborations and Ecosystem Building:**\n  - We have continued to forge and strengthen meaningful collaborations with various organizations and groups such as Tulum Circula, Day Zero, Tulum Coin DAO, Maximo Pollismo, Bocho Burger and Regen Week. These partnerships have allowed us to create proof points for the new economic systems and incentivization models we are building. This year, we were able to showcase how doing good deeds can result in real world benefits such as being able to go to a popular Tulum music festival like Day Zero. \n\n![regeneconomy gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJiYkP3eC.jpg)\n\n- **Launch of ReFi Rides:**\n  - Our latest initiative, ReFi Rides, marks a significant step towards a cleaner future through a unique blend of sustainability and technology, providing exclusive NFTs that grant unlimited access to electric motorbikes in Tulum. The NFTs grant access to unlimited use of eMotorbikes in Tulum and in future locations such as Mexico City that will make up our network. The Originals ReFi Rides NFTs represent 33 real world e-motorcycles and shared ownership in fleet vehicles. Through real-world asset staking, we aim to democratize ownership and incentivize sustainable transportation practices.\n![refirides gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By40xvnlC.jpg)\n\n\n- **Plastic Neutrality and Plastic Credits:**\n  - We successfully launched plastic credits on empower.eco, initiating payouts and incentivizing plastic waste reduction efforts. These credits serve as a tangible measure of our impact in mitigating plastic pollution and promoting environmental stewardship.\n\n![plasticcredits gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkkdWwhxC.png)\n- To date we have reported 1,088 kilos of plastic sequestered and removed from the environment which has been recorded on the empower.eco blockchain. According to conservative methods to estimate GHG emissions, this would equate to 1,632 kg of CO2 equivalent or 1.5 kg of C02 for  each kilogram of plastic removed from the environment.\n\n\n**Milestones Achieved in Tulum:** \n\nWe achieved several milestones in Tulum during Q1, including:\n1. Proving out our incentives and token rewards model through community engagement activities that resulted in sufficient tokens to purchase a ticket to the Day Zero Festival in Tulum.\n2. Partnering with Bye Bye Plastic for a beach cleanup of Unesco World Heritage site Sian Kaan, resulting in the removal of 357 kilos of plastic. \n![fullcleanup byebye gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJhbtvnx0.jpg)\n\n3. Planting 50 trees as part of the Tulum’s Reforestation Campaign 2024, contributing to the greening of our community.\n![geraplantinggg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryNDOP3xR.jpg)\n\n4. Hosting self-organized events at Tulum Circula to catalyze the community and support infrastructure needs. \n![stephcrates](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJl5BP2gA.jpg)\n\n5. Participating in various events in Tulum and globally to advocate for ReFi Initiatives such as BitBasel and Regen Week.\n6. Continued weekly educational events hosted at the NFT Boutique on ReFi topics \n\n\n**Challenges Faced:**\nEarly in our acquisition process of the TF100 technology, it became evident that the existing technology did not meet our environmental or operational standards.  We have worked with several different design engineers and settled on a modification that will both create a closed system for plastic re-molding and reduce operator exposure. The following modifications are currently underway that can achieve both goals:\n![TF100mods gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJb9iDhl0.jpg)\n\n\n* Modification of the plastic foundry to operate with a furnace and plastic flakes.\n* Implementation of safety measures to protect operators.\n* Manipulation of molds using rails to reduce contact with plastic.\n* Installation of a mold base and a 4-inch extractor to prevent smoke dispersion.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- We have learned the importance of flexibility and adaptability in navigating challenges and as eager as we were to start making new products from the TF100, we realized it would not be the right path forward. \n- Building strong partnerships and collaborations is key to amplifying our impact and achieving meaningful outcomes in our initiatives.\n\n**Utilization of Additional Funding:**\nThe additional funding from the upcoming round will be instrumental in:\n*  Scaling our plastic neutrality and eMobility initiatives to reach a broader audience and deepen our impact.\n* Complete modifications to the TF100 machine to optimize its performance and increase efficiency in plastic sequestration.\n* Hire a dedicated operator to work regularly with the TF100 machine, ensuring consistent operation and maximizing plastic sequestration efforts.\n* Strengthening our team and expanding our network of collaborators to sustain momentum and drive further innovation..\n* Invest in business development activities to forge partnerships and collaborations that will further advance our mission and expand our reach.\n* Continue to maintain and improve our fleet of ReFi Rides, ensuring reliable and sustainable transportation options for the community while reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\n![sunset tulum gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByRpZdnxC.jpg)\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"refitulum"},"recipient":"0xd28e4e6Be770D7c17CbE211A3DdE56b829e98987"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreiarh5juentznyfeeqg5ll2e2bgkvfgg2wjuzwpp4nhk32gsuxfvaa","projects":[{"name":"Tulum’s Tomorrow, Accelerating the Regenaissance with ReFi Tulum","id":"0x4b83a5d97e5d381163de8d94bdd837b516cca0f6e52149e3e195aac27c53459a","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"Tulum’s Tomorrow, Accelerating the Regenaissance with ReFi Tulum","logoImg":"bafkreibnvdsrmw6d2p24jyqhg5gm7xbqkphnyhekb235ly3ldp7a4ennku","website":"https://refitulum.io/","bannerImg":"bafkreia3omusq2ryu7kentr3bqduk5f3nf2la53q2gw2jvokxqiderx2su","createdAt":1722856939472,"userGithub":"sandrapdl","credentials":{},"description":"# Tulum’s Tomorrow, Accelerating the Regenaissance with ReFi Tulum\n\n\n***GG21 Updates**\n1) Purchase of 2 new eBikes for Refi Rides and Regenerative Tourisim  We have added 2 ebikes to our Refi Rides fleet. These ebikes will be part of our regenerative tourism experiences and activations.\n![ebikes](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJH7SNRYR.png)\n\n\n\n2)We are working to find a new worker to finish our tf100 updates. It has been frustrating that our previous worker started the modifications and has left us high and dry. We are actively looking for another skilled worker to take on the modifications. \n\n3) We have contributed to the shipping costs of bringing Robotina, a small demo plant of Petgas to bring to Tulum.We are working with Petgas to bring a small demo plant to Tulum. We have been cleaning the area where the plant will go and getting it ready to set up. The plant, affectionately called Robotina, will be able to process 90 kilos of plastic every time it runs and transform it into fuels. The purpose of having this plant here is to demonstrate the technology and the full circularity of our plastic sequestration model.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate ReFi Tulum's commitment to addressing the climate crisis through practical and impactful solutions.\n![gg21 robotina](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJrbfNRt0.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Update on Project Progress and Impact:**\nTL;DR: \nWe have been making significant progress towards a regenerative future for Tulum with the launch of ReFi Rides, plastic credits, and strengthening our strategic partnerships with organizations like Tulum Circula and Day Zero. Both of these initiatives have an impact on Climate and are actively reducing environmental GHGs by eliminating plastic deterioration in nature and landfills as well as developing more sustainable transportation options with minimal to zero emissions.\n\n\nAdditionally we are promoting and advancing new economic systems  through continued community clean-up efforts rewarded with tokens that can be used for products, services and events. We are excited to be putting into play the proof points for the new economic system of the future -  leveraging technology, community activations and environmental responsibility to pave the path to a regenerative future for Tulum.\n\n\n **Focus Areas:** \n  - **Plastic Neutrality and RWA (Real World Asset) eMobility:** \nOur primary focus has been on our plastic neutrality initiatives and ReFi Rides, our eMotorbike NFT RWA fleet that blends digital ownership with eco-friendly transportation. We remain convinced of the importance and value of regenerative tourism for Tulum. However, as a small team coming into the low (summer) season for Tulum tourism, we have decided to lessen our focus on developing regenerative tourism experiences. However, we will continue to engage with inbound interest that comes our way for these types of regenerative experiences. We also see that ReFi Rides will also have an exciting role to play in building out our regenerative tourism options in the future.\n![ecosystem gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy7HAUngR.png)\n\n\n  \n- **Collaborations and Ecosystem Building:**\n  - We have continued to forge and strengthen meaningful collaborations with various organizations and groups such as Tulum Circula, Day Zero, Tulum Coin DAO, Maximo Pollismo, Bocho Burger and Regen Week. These partnerships have allowed us to create proof points for the new economic systems and incentivization models we are building. This year, we were able to showcase how doing good deeds can result in real world benefits such as being able to go to a popular Tulum music festival like Day Zero. \n\n![regeneconomy gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJiYkP3eC.jpg)\n\n- **Launch of ReFi Rides:**\n  - Our latest initiative, ReFi Rides, marks a significant step towards a cleaner future through a unique blend of sustainability and technology, providing exclusive NFTs that grant unlimited access to electric motorbikes in Tulum. The NFTs grant access to unlimited use of eMotorbikes in Tulum and in future locations such as Mexico City that will make up our network. The Originals ReFi Rides NFTs represent 33 real world e-motorcycles and shared ownership in fleet vehicles. Through real-world asset staking, we aim to democratize ownership and incentivize sustainable transportation practices.\n![refirides gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By40xvnlC.jpg)\n\n\n- **Plastic Neutrality and Plastic Credits:**\n  - We successfully launched plastic credits on empower.eco, initiating payouts and incentivizing plastic waste reduction efforts. These credits serve as a tangible measure of our impact in mitigating plastic pollution and promoting environmental stewardship.\n\n![plasticcredits gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkkdWwhxC.png)\n- To date we have reported 1,088 kilos of plastic sequestered and removed from the environment which has been recorded on the empower.eco blockchain. According to conservative methods to estimate GHG emissions, this would equate to 1,632 kg of CO2 equivalent or 1.5 kg of C02 for  each kilogram of plastic removed from the environment.\n\n\n**Milestones Achieved in Tulum:** \n\nWe achieved several milestones in Tulum during Q1, including:\n1. Proving out our incentives and token rewards model through community engagement activities that resulted in sufficient tokens to purchase a ticket to the Day Zero Festival in Tulum.\n2. Partnering with Bye Bye Plastic for a beach cleanup of Unesco World Heritage site Sian Kaan, resulting in the removal of 357 kilos of plastic. \n![fullcleanup byebye gg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJhbtvnx0.jpg)\n\n3. Planting 50 trees as part of the Tulum’s Reforestation Campaign 2024, contributing to the greening of our community.\n![geraplantinggg20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryNDOP3xR.jpg)\n\n4. Hosting self-organized events at Tulum Circula to catalyze the community and support infrastructure needs. \n![stephcrates](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJl5BP2gA.jpg)\n\n5. Participating in various events in Tulum and globally to advocate for ReFi Initiatives such as BitBasel and Regen Week.\n6.

ReFi PDX is excited to be a part of the Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round! \n\n\n## By building cosmolocal ecosystems for regeneration like the Regen Coordi-Nation, we can create a path towards a more resilient future for local communities as they face the increasingly threatening impacts of the ecological, social, economic and other interconnected crises.\n\n\nPortland is located roughly 100 miles upstream of the mouth of the largest watershed in the Cascadia Bioregion. The Portland Metro area rests on traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Wasco, Cowlitz, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Bands of Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, and many other tribes who made their homes along the Columbia River. The city has often been characterized as a forward-thinking or even radical city and the people here have fought for many environmental and social victories over the decades. Especially recently, our political systems have been plagued by capture and a resistance to meeting the challenges of our time head on. \n\nLuckily, our culture continuously produces a mindset primed for decentralized thinking. We anticipate the adoption of ReFi as an inevitable part of the regenerative transition of our city.\n\n\nOne contributor is the founder of Cascadia Carbon, a ReFi project minting NFTrees backed by real trees. The usage of tools like Cascadia Carbon’s CODEX is crucial in lowering the barrier to positively impactful ecological work, and aligning economic and ecological benefit. This deep experience in the ReFi space will be a big resource to our local node.\n\nAnother one of our contributors is a part of Ethereal Forest, a working group building PDX DAO, an ecosystem of DAOs local to Portland. The vision of the Regen Coordi-Nation fits well with Ethereal Forest’s hopes for City DAOs, with DAOs of every shape, purpose and flavor forming a web of local solidarity and mutuality. Each of them connected to their global networks of alignment, similar to ours the Regen Coordi-Nation.\n\n\n## Areas we want to be focusing on:\n\n### Native Species Biodiversity\n\nUtilizing emerging tools like CODEX and Silvi, we hope to bolster native species biodiversity in our region though creating more access to the knowledge, materials and funding needed to revitalize the ecology of our urban landscape. Over the years, we see these technologies progressing towards an augmented reality game similar to Pokemon Go, where people of all walks of life can participate in the rewilding of their neighborhood. Ideally we help empower people with low income and access to receive funding for this work through partnerships with local, ethical, small businesses looking to invest in the city’s ecological well being.\n\n### Local Food Systems\n\nThe Portland area is already home to a large and growing community of small scale, local, regenerative farmers and urban gardeners. We hope to eventually collaborate with these producers to build a decentralized network of food production that can support each neighborhood in the city through the increasing acute and chronic stressors they experience. Coordinating the production and distribution of food in a local setting will be challenging, but bringing web3 and adjacent tools to these communities that are already engaging in this work can help growers understand what the needs are and allows consumers to have easier access to the foods grown closest to them.\n\n### Community Economic Experimentation\n\nLots of organizations and people in Portland are already interested in and building circular economies and participatory budgeting systems for their communities. As the capabilities of web3 tools progresses, we will be collaborating with these organizations and communities to boost the ability to allocate resources to the regenerative projects already doing good work. This will increase the flywheel of regenerative actions in the city and enable more people to engage in this work. Experiments in Circular Economy, Participatory Budgeting, Mutual Credit, Gift Economies and more will further empower existing networks and communities in Portland to build their own social support systems and give more autonomy back through increased access to collective action tools.\n\n### Education and Community Building  \n\nAlthough people in Portland are already very aware of the interconnected issues that we all face. Recognizing our role as American consumers participating in Imperialism, Capitalism and other systems of extraction, we hope to show Portlanders the power that local peer to peer networks can have in decreasing our contributions to these systems that take resources from and harm humans and the non-human on Earth. Education and community building will begin as meetups and transition towards programming for people interested in the applications of web3 in building local regenerative systems of production. Presentations and events focused on ReFi, web3 and related topics will be held with interested local organizations and individuals.\n\n\n### Please share the love with the other exciting local communities in this round :)","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"ReFi_PDX"},"recipient":"0x1B74ab2796703F142c465507fA6E3125fad46719"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreihpcpuhktqtmxhixkgb3wiknt6bpbjrj6attemfumezex4i6xn3gm","projects":[{"name":"ReFi PDX","id":"0xa5cd06685666607b2591681abcc4efa5515b3d64c3779484cdc4d608f7123692","metadata":{"type":"project","title":"ReFi PDX","logoImg":"bafkreichqwndtotqy34es5646b353v2mg5yqh6gvbtmtukh3ui7pz5g2yq","website":"https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/ReFi-PDX-Portland-7e213cebc8484630b3597ee20ec00d14","bannerImg":"bafkreif6jnhtf4ip67cjl6kx4fps3mpmjo5ne3yt5o2cfxkspi7gbjr4s4","createdAt":1722970720322,"credentials":{},"description":"# ReFi PDX is excited to be a part of the Regen Coordi-Nation Genesis Round! \n\n\n## By building cosmolocal ecosystems for regeneration like the Regen Coordi-Nation, we can create a path towards a more resilient future for local communities as they face the increasingly threatening impacts of the ecological, social, economic and other interconnected crises.\n\n\nPortland is located roughly 100 miles upstream of the mouth of the largest watershed in the Cascadia Bioregion.

The vision of the Regen Coordi-Nation fits well with Ethereal Forest’s hopes for City DAOs, with DAOs of every shape, purpose and flavor forming a web of local solidarity and mutuality. Each of them connected to their global networks of alignment, similar to ours the Regen Coordi-Nation.\n\n\n## Areas we want to be focusing on:\n\n### Native Species Biodiversity\n\nUtilizing emerging tools like CODEX and Silvi, we hope to bolster native species biodiversity in our region though creating more access to the knowledge, materials and funding needed to revitalize the ecology of our urban landscape. Over the years, we see these technologies progressing towards an augmented reality game similar to Pokemon Go, where people of all walks of life can participate in the rewilding of their neighborhood. Ideally we help empower people with low income and access to receive funding for this work through partnerships with local, ethical, small businesses looking to invest in the city’s ecological well being.\n\n### Local Food Systems\n\nThe Portland area is already home to a large and growing community of small scale, local, regenerative farmers and urban gardeners. We hope to eventually collaborate with these producers to build a decentralized network of food production that can support each neighborhood in the city through the increasing acute and chronic stressors they experience. Coordinating the production and distribution of food in a local setting will be challenging, but bringing web3 and adjacent tools to these communities that are already engaging in this work can help growers understand what the needs are and allows consumers to have easier access to the foods grown closest to them.\n\n### Community Economic Experimentation\n\nLots of organizations and people in Portland are already interested in and building circular economies and participatory budgeting systems for their communities. As the capabilities of web3 tools progresses, we will be collaborating with these organizations and communities to boost the ability to allocate resources to the regenerative projects already doing good work. This will increase the flywheel of regenerative actions in the city and enable more people to engage in this work. Experiments in Circular Economy, Participatory Budgeting, Mutual Credit, Gift Economies and more will further empower existing networks and communities in Portland to build their own social support systems and give more autonomy back through increased access to collective action tools.\n\n### Education and Community Building  \n\nAlthough people in Portland are already very aware of the interconnected issues that we all face. Recognizing our role as American consumers participating in Imperialism, Capitalism and other systems of extraction, we hope to show Portlanders the power that local peer to peer networks can have in decreasing our contributions to these systems that take resources from and harm humans and the non-human on Earth. Education and community building will begin as meetups and transition towards programming for people interested in the applications of web3 in building local regenerative systems of production. Presentations and events focused on ReFi, web3 and related topics will be held with interested local organizations and individuals.\n\n\n### Please share the love with the other exciting local communities in this round

ReFi Latin America\n\nReFi Latin America was established in late 2023 with the mission of uniting and supporting all ReFi Local Nodes across Latin America. As an umbrella organization, ReFi Latin America provides assistance in content creation, education, and fundraising, aiming to spark interest in establishing new Local Nodes in the region and redirecting interested communities to ReFi DAO.\n\n## Key Milestones\n\n- **Establishment (Late 2023)**: ReFi Latin America was launched to serve as a hub for ReFi Local Node initiatives in Latin America.\n- **Growth Phase**: The organization began integrating various Latin American Local Nodes, offering support in Spanish and meeting specific local needs.\n- **Representation at Devcon SEA**: ReFi Latin America will be represented at Devcon in Bangkok in November 2024.\n- **Educational Material Creation**: The goal is to start producing educational resources in Spanish to better serve the local communities. Later, the goal is to expand to Portuguese as well.\n- **Support in Content Creation and Fundraising**: Assistance will be provided through major platforms like Gitcoin and Giveth, focusing on content creation and fundraising.\n\n## Impact\n\nReFi Latin America has had a considerable impact by consolidating efforts across the region, providing much-needed resources in local languages, and enhancing communication and collaboration among various nodes. \n\n## Fundraising\n\nReFi Latin America supports fundraising efforts through platforms like Gitcoin and Giveth, enabling local nodes in Latin America to secure necessary funding for their projects and initiatives.\n\n## Challenges\n\n- **Small Team**: The organization currently operates with a limited number of team members.\n- **Numerous Local Nodes**: There is a significant number of Local Nodes in Latin America, presenting a challenge in providing adequate support to all for now.\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- **Enhanced Representation**: ReFi Latin America can amplify the voice of Latin American Local Nodes within ReFi DAO.\n- **Community Building**: By bringing together representatives from various local nodes, the organization can better address and articulate the needs of these communities.\n- **Event Promotion**: ReFi Latin America can help promote local events and projects, raising awareness and participation within the Latin American community.\n\nWith the potential funds raised this quarter, ReFi Latin America is planning to undertake several key projects and programs to further support and expand its initiatives across the region. The primary focus will be on the following:\n\n## Key Projects/Programs\n\n### Creation of Materials in Spanish:\n\n- **Local Node Toolkit**: Translate the ReFi DAO’s Local Node toolkit in Spanish\n- **Educational Content**: Expanding the range of educational materials, including guides, tutorials, and best practices, tailored to the specific needs of Latin American communities.\n\n### Support for Projects/Events:\n\n- **Financial Assistance**: Allocating funds to support various projects and events organized by local nodes that require financial backing in the coming months.\n- **Event Sponsorships**: Providing sponsorships for key events that promote ReFi principles and projects, facilitating broader participation and visibility.\n\n### Twitter Spaces for Community Gathering:\n\n- **Virtual Meetups**: Creating regular Twitter Spaces sessions to serve as gathering spots for ReFi Local Nodes across Latin America.\n- **Topic Discussions**: Hosting discussions on relevant topics, challenges, and opportunities within the ReFi space, allowing for real-time interaction and community building.\n\n## Node Leads, Core Team, Collaborators, and Advisors:\n\n- Anna Kaic\n\n## Focus Areas\n\n### Focus Area 1: Web3 Education in Spanish\n\n- **Description**: ReFi Latin America aims to translate and develop educational resources related to Web3 technologies in Spanish. This includes the Local Node toolkit and other necessary resources to support the understanding and implementation of Web3 concepts.\n- **Importance to the Local Community**: Many local node leaders and members in Latin America face language barriers as most materials are available only in English. Providing these resources in Spanish will significantly improve accessibility and comprehension, enabling communities to leverage Web3 technologies for local initiatives.\n- **Specific Goals or Objectives**:\n  - Translate the Local Node toolkit into Spanish.\n  - Develop supplementary educational materials in Spanish.\n  - Conduct workshops and training sessions in Spanish to enhance understanding of Web3 technologies.\n- **Challenges or Barriers Addressed**: The lack of Spanish-language materials creates a significant obstacle for local node leaders and members.

As an umbrella organization, ReFi Latin America provides assistance in content creation, education, and fundraising, aiming to spark interest in establishing new Local Nodes in the region and redirecting interested communities to ReFi DAO.\n\n## Key Milestones\n\n- **Establishment (Late 2023)**: ReFi Latin America was launched to serve as a hub for ReFi Local Node initiatives in Latin America.\n- **Growth Phase**: The organization began integrating various Latin American Local Nodes, offering support in Spanish and meeting specific local needs.\n- **Representation at Devcon SEA**: ReFi Latin America will be represented at Devcon in Bangkok in November 2024.\n- **Educational Material Creation**: The goal is to start producing educational resources in Spanish to better serve the local communities. Later, the goal is to expand to Portuguese as well.\n- **Support in Content Creation and Fundraising**: Assistance will be provided through major platforms like Gitcoin and Giveth, focusing on content creation and fundraising.\n\n## Impact\n\nReFi Latin America has had a considerable impact by consolidating efforts across the region, providing much-needed resources in local languages, and enhancing communication and collaboration among various nodes. \n\n## Fundraising\n\nReFi Latin America supports fundraising efforts through platforms like Gitcoin and Giveth, enabling local nodes in Latin America to secure necessary funding for their projects and initiatives.\n\n## Challenges\n\n- **Small Team**: The organization currently operates with a limited number of team members.\n- **Numerous Local Nodes**: There is a significant number of Local Nodes in Latin America, presenting a challenge in providing adequate support to all for now.\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- **Enhanced Representation**: ReFi Latin America can amplify the voice of Latin American Local Nodes within ReFi DAO.\n- **Community Building**: By bringing together representatives from various local nodes, the organization can better address and articulate the needs of these communities.\n- **Event Promotion**: ReFi Latin America can help promote local events and projects, raising awareness and participation within the Latin American community.\n\nWith the potential funds raised this quarter, ReFi Latin America is planning to undertake several key projects and programs to further support and expand its initiatives across the region. The primary focus will be on the following:\n\n## Key Projects/Programs\n\n### Creation of Materials in Spanish:\n\n- **Local Node Toolkit**: Translate the ReFi DAO’s Local Node toolkit in Spanish\n- **Educational Content**: Expanding the range of educational materials, including guides, tutorials, and best practices, tailored to the specific needs of Latin American communities.\n\n### Support for Projects/Events:\n\n- **Financial Assistance**: Allocating funds to support various projects and events organized by local nodes that require financial backing in the coming months.\n- **Event Sponsorships**: Providing sponsorships for key events that promote ReFi principles and projects, facilitating broader participation and visibility.\n\n### Twitter Spaces for Community Gathering:\n\n- **Virtual Meetups**: Creating regular Twitter Spaces sessions to serve as gathering spots for ReFi Local Nodes across Latin America.\n- **Topic Discussions**: Hosting discussions on relevant topics, challenges, and opportunities within the ReFi space, allowing for real-time interaction and community building.\n\n## Node Leads, Core Team, Collaborators, and Advisors:\n\n- Anna Kaic\n\n## Focus Areas\n\n### Focus Area 1: Web3 Education in Spanish\n\n- **Description**: ReFi Latin America aims to translate and develop educational resources related to Web3 technologies in Spanish. This includes the Local Node toolkit and other necessary resources to support the understanding and implementation of Web3 concepts.\n- **Importance to the Local Community**: Many local node leaders and members in Latin America face language barriers as most materials are available only in English. Providing these resources in Spanish will significantly improve accessibility and comprehension, enabling communities to leverage Web3 technologies for local initiatives.\n- **Specific Goals or Objectives**:\n  - Translate the Local Node toolkit into Spanish.\n  - Develop supplementary educational materials in Spanish.\n  - Conduct workshops and training sessions in Spanish to enhance understanding of Web3 technologies.\n- **Challenges or Barriers Addressed**: The lack of Spanish-language materials creates a significant obstacle for local node leaders and members. Addressing this will empower these communities to fully engage with ReFi initiatives.\n- **Target Populations or Stakeholders**: Local Node founders, members, and local communities within the Local Nodes in Latin America.\n- **Core Partnerships or Potential Collaborations**: Partnership with ReFi DAO and collaboration with all Local Nodes in Latin America.\n\n### Focus Area 2: Community Resilience\n\n- **Description**: The number of local nodes in Latin America is rapidly growing. The best way to voice their needs, which are often similar due to the geopolitical situation in Latam, is to create an umbrella Local Node that gathers representatives from all Local Nodes in the region. This structure will enhance communication with ReFi DAO and foster a culture of mutual support among nodes that communicate in Spanish and Portuguese.\n- **Specific Goals or Objectives**:\n  - Establish an umbrella organization to consolidate the efforts and needs of all Latin American Local Nodes.\n  - Improve communication and collaboration between local nodes and ReFi DAO.\n  - Facilitate resource sharing and mutual support among local nodes.\n- **Challenges or Barriers Addressed**:\n  - The rapid growth in the number of Local Nodes in Latam.\n  - Language barriers as needs and challenges are often voiced differently in one's native language compared to English.\n- **Target Populations or Stakeholders**: All Local Node founders, members, and local communities within Local Nodes in Latin America.\n- **Core Partnerships or Potential Collaborations**: Partnership with ReFi DAO and collaboration with all Local Nodes in Latin America.\n\n## Projects & Initiatives\n\n### Program/Initiative 1: Educational Web3 Materials in Spanish\n\n- **Stage**: Planning stage\n- **Detailed Description**:\n  - **Goal**: Translate the Local Node toolkit into Spanish and create additional complementary educational materials in Spanish.\n  - **Activities**: Conduct monthly educational Twitter Spaces in both Spanish and Portuguese to engage and educate local node leaders and members.\n  - **Timeline**: The project aims to be completed by December 2024 or early 2025.\n- **Target Audience or Beneficiaries**: All local node leaders in Latin America, including founders, members, and the broader community involved in Local Nodes.\n- **Key Partners Involved**: ReFi DAO and Local Nodes across Latin America\n- **Impact or Outcomes Achieved So Far**: This initiative is currently in the planning stage, so specific impacts or outcomes are not yet available.

Mexico\n\n1. Current Utilization of Celo:\n\nIntegration with Celo:\nGreenPill Mexico has begun integrating Celo’s blockchain technology into our projects to enhance coordination and collaboration in addressing sociocultural and environmental challenges. We utilize Celo’s stablecoins to manage funds securely and transparently, ensuring that our financial transactions support our mission of promoting regenerative web3 tools.\n\nPartnerships and Collaborations:\nWe have established collaborations with Celo-based projects and organizations to leverage their expertise and resources. These partnerships help us align with Celo’s goals and utilize its technology to drive our initiatives forward.\n\nImpact and Outcomes:\nThe integration with Celo has facilitated more efficient financial management and provided a stable platform for our transactions. This has allowed us to focus more on our core mission—enhancing sociocultural and environmental impact—by streamlining our financial operations.\n\n2. Roadmap for Future Utilization:\n\nPlanned Integrations:\nIn the coming months, GreenPill Mexico plans to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on the Celo blockchain that will support our mission. These applications will focus on practical sociocultural solutions, such as tools for community engagement and environmental monitoring, using Celo’s infrastructure to ensure reliability and scalability.\n\nDevelopment Goals:\nOur development goals include creating platforms for educational initiatives that promote web3 technologies and integrating Celo’s tools into these platforms. This will enable us to provide hands-on experiences with web3 technologies to our community, enhancing their ability to engage with and benefit from these innovations.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem Alignment:\nWe aim to deepen our involvement in the Celo ecosystem by participating in community events, contributing to discussions, and collaborating on projects that align with both GreenPill Mexico’s and Celo’s objectives. This alignment will help us build a stronger network and foster innovation within the ecosystem.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nBy aligning with Celo, we anticipate improved efficiency and scalability for our initiatives. The integration will allow us to expand our impact, reach a broader audience, and drive greater engagement with web3 technologies in Mexico.\n\n3. Support and Contribution:\n\nSupporting the Celo Ecosystem:\nGreenPill Mexico is committed to supporting the Celo ecosystem through active participation and collaboration. We provide feedback on Celo’s tools, share our insights with the community, and work with Celo-based projects to drive mutual success.\n\nAdvocacy and Promotion:\nWe actively promote the adoption of Celo’s technology within our network and beyond. This includes creating educational content to raise awareness about the benefits of Celo and advocating for its use in projects that align with our mission of addressing sociocultural and environmental challenges.","hidden":false,"question":"If applicable, describe how your project/community has been utilising or supporting the Celo ecosystem, or explain a roadmap for your plans to

Users typically save in a Stable coins, DAI, USDT or USDC\n\n[![AF7v-Gr-N-Imgur.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvGCG2Lx/AF7v-Gr-N-Imgur.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V5hKg2DV)\n\n2. Users can create a savings plan and make unlimited deposits to their savings plan, e.g., \"Rent, School fees, Vacation\" etc, and they earn rewards in the protocol tokens $BTS, typically the native token of the Bitsave Protocol.\n\n[![fy-PBgl-B-Imgur.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FszjGxtb/fy-PBgl-B-Imgur.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mtxzgCgh)\n\n3. Users can create a savings plan in 3 simple steps, and set different parameters for their savings plan;\n\n- Name your savings plan\n- Set the duration for your savings, using the calendar\n- Set a penalty fee if you forfeit your savings\n\n[![image.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zGnSRGZ4/image.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/3kxDs7wZ)\n\n[![n-ROUm-OO-Imgur.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/TP2GW0Hm/n-ROUm-OO-Imgur.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/VJh2xqwL)\n\n[![image-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cCR5hyvJ/image-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zHfjDQSm)\n\n[![4-J1l-BRY-Imgur.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MHV88QN9/4-J1l-BRY-Imgur.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4Hf06mJc)\n\n***A Side Note 🗒️***\n\nBitsave isn't just another product, it's a new value chain. The web3 space is used to DeFi which are investment protocols, and now we're introducing them to SaveFi which are savings protocols that prioritize the stability of user savings over earning from crypto volatility.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IN THE BITSAVE PROTOCOL\n\n1. Users Create a Savings plan and deposit in a Stable Coin.\n\n- Users aren't depositing into a pool like DeFi protocols that a hacker could access.\n\n- When a user is creating a savings plan, they're giving parameters for a child contract to be created under the Bitsave Protocol Parent contract which holds their funds and is only accessible by their wallet.\n\nThis makes it such that every user's savings deposit is tied to their wallet so that in case of an exploit, the hacker wouldn't have access to user funds, except they have access to user's private keys.\n\n1. Users' Interests\n- Interests are calculated using several variables and constants in the algorithm;\n-Simple interest formula\n-Bitsave Rate formula.\n-Bitsave has a buy-back mechanism that buys\n\n2. Users' Savings Plans and Fees\nUsers are charged a 1-time savings fee on savings plan creation (child contract), every fee is split in a 50:50 ratio, where 1 part goes to a buy-back wallet to buy back the protocol native tokens from any AMM or Dex in the native chain's ecosystem.\n\n\nROADMAP TIMELINE\n***ROADMAP (Inception till date)***\n\nBitsave's detailed Development Timelines\n\n**2022**\n\n- Maths and Formula Creation -

Creating a Savings Plan and Secure Deposits**  \n- Users initiate a savings plan by depositing funds in a stablecoin—not into a pooled DeFi protocol that might be vulnerable to hacks.  \n\n- During plan creation, the user sets specific parameters, triggering the deployment of a child contract under the Bitsave Protocol Parent contract. \n\nThis contract securely holds the deposited funds and is exclusively accessible via the user’s wallet.  \n[![create-sav.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MT9RpcyH/create-sav.png)](https://postimg.cc/sQZ1ngHC)\n\n- The Bitsave Parent-Child smartcontract design makes it such that each user's savings are directly tied to their wallet, so even in the event of a  protocol exploit, the hacker would need to get each users wallet private keys to access the funds. \n[![dur.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXzSpx6x/dur.png)](https://postimg.cc/CzM72y06)\n\n- Every user’s savings deposit is tied to their wallet so that in case of an exploit, the hacker wouldn’t have access to user funds, except they have access to users' wallet private keys, this minimises the risks of users losing their funds to exploits.\n\n\n**2. Savings Plans and Fee Structure**  \n- When creating a savings plan, users incur a one-time $1 or less, fee for creating the Savings contract.\n\n\n**3. Break Savings Penalties**\nUsers set the penalty fee (1%–5% of their savings) when creating the plan. Users with bad savings habit who want to discipline them selves to save and discourage themselves from breaking their savings usually set the highest fee. If they break their savings early, the penalty is deducted.\n[![pen.png](https://i.postimg.cc/V5P0vXHq/pen.png)](https://postimg.cc/FkGHnkvz)\n\n**4. Multiple Savings Purpose and Naming**\nUsers can create multiple savings plans for different purposes and manage them on Bitsave; vacation, rent, school fees, emergencies etc.\n[![sav.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wTt1JxKt/sav.png)](https://postimg.cc/N5cGvcjY)\n\n**5. Top Up**\nBitsave Top-Up feature makes it easy, for users to create recurring savings for diferrent purposes; so if a user was saving for rent and they wanted to save $100 every month for 6 months, then all they need to do is create a Savings Plan for rent and top $100 every month.\n[![top-up.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrQrZD0M/top-up.png)](https://postimg.cc/rdwTQ8yF)\n\n## SaveFi vs DeFi .....*Web3 Understands DeFi, Bitsave has introduced SaveFi.*\n\nGlobally, there are 4 popular players in Finance;\n-Banks (Including Co-Operatives, Credit Unions, Brokerage firms etc)\n-Centralized Exchanges\n-DeFi\n-SaveFI\n\nSaveFi is Both Decentralized and Affordable because it focuses on savings and not investments.\n[![savefi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SK3t28Zj/savefi.png)](https://postimg.cc/4Kv1jKRT)\n\nSavings and Investments aren't the same thing.\n[![sa.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tCvwSnX5/sa.png)](https://postimg.cc/KRL04z3k)\n\n- Savings prioritizes safety and availability of funds over interests.\n- Investments prioritizes risks over safety of funds, for financial gain.\n\nBitsave Users are users who just want a tool that helps them keep money for the rainy days.\n\nBitsave users use Bitsave to save and not invest, they want to achieve their savings goals in the left side of this table👇🏽\n[![sav-in.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4dPVtvWG/sav-in.png)](https://postimg.cc/8JF7gv8X)\n\n# WHY BITSAVE?\n\n😌It's easy - Everyone is familiar with the concept of putting money aside for a raining day. And our UX makes it understandable for users to take the savings journey onchain.\n\n🧮It helps Personal Finance and Accountability for Web3 Natives who earn consistent income. Users can track their savings and manage withdrawals and expenses using Bitsave.\n[![sav-plan.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXgBtfjR/sav-plan.png)](https://postimg.cc/RNLt7nGD)\n\n🧐Bitsave focus is on Savings, not investment, there are already superflous DeFi protocols that caters to investment purposes, Bitsave's Focus is on Savings only.\n\n\n## SAFETY FIRST --> Bitsave Parent-Child Contract Structure \n\nThe Child-Parent Contract Function in Bitsave is a contract structure feature that ensures users' funds remain safe;\n\n**Savings Plan Creation:**\nWhen a user sets up a savings plan on Bitsave, they are NOT depositing funds into a shared liquidity pool.\n\nInstead, a child smart contract is automatically generated based on their selected savings parameters of time, amount, name etc\n\nThat contract is created when a user \"Joins Bitsave\", you can see it here👇🏽\n[![join.png](https://i.postimg.cc/JzqTzm5G/join.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvv7FpjS)\n\nTransaction hash\nhttps://basescan.org/address/0x3593546078eecd0ffd1c19317f53ee565be6ca13\n\n\n**Child Contracts & Security:**\nEach child contract is directly linked to the user's wallet and funds are stored in this contract, making it isolated from other users' funds and preventing large-scale exploits.\n\nSince the funds remain within individual contracts, any attempt to move them requires wallet approval from the user.\n\n**Protection Against Exploits:**\n\nIf a hacker tries to breach Bitsave’s system, they won’t find a single pool of funds to drain.\n\nInstead, they would have to individually compromise each user’s wallet by getting their approval for transactions.\n\nFor instance, if Bitsave has 50,000 users, an attacker would need to obtain 50,000 separate transaction approvals, making the exploit practically impossible.\n\n**Compounding & User Benefits:**\n\nSince the funds are stored in individual contracts, recurring savings and top ups make it easier for users to just manage their savings.\n\n**Bitsave's introduction of SaveFi**\nDecentralized Protection: Users retain ownership of their funds, reducing the risk of centralized failures or large-scale hacks.\n\nNo Third-Party Custody: Bitsave never holds user funds, aligning with non-custodial DeFi principles.\n\nEnhanced Security Model: Even in a worst-case scenario, a hacker would need the user’s direct on-chain approval to steal funds, making mass exploitation nearly impossible.\n\n*The Future of Savings in Web3 is Savefi*\n\n\n## GOAL - 1 Million users \nBring a million savers onchain with Bitsave in 2 years.\n\n\n**Bitsave Events and Onboarding Sessions**\n1.

We’ve jumpstarted over 7,000 local urban and agroecology farms worldwide, 400+ community enterprises, and built permanent foundations for regenerative cultures. Our members have deep knowledge of how to achieve climate adaptation and watershed restoration, with decades of experience building local economies.\n\n[![5.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xjw3tw9R/5.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V5FtNHrr)\n*pictured: Broadfield Enterprises, Uganda, food security and African economic sovereignty*\n\n\n# **Local Action Rewards** \n\n🎡 Thanks to your support in GG20, we successfully launched Bloom's Local Action Rewards to incentivize people to document their community impact and share knowledge. Our funding model enables peer learning and provides crucial financing for collaborative community labor, solving a major gap in philanthropy and **community-led economic development**.\n\nIt doubles as a media hacking platform, aggregating beautiful stories of inspiring communities from around the world, and giving people the tools and encouragement to organize where they live. **From separation to coordi-nation.**\n\n**GG21 Contribution Allocation:**\n- 90% to the Local Action Rewards pool.\n- 10% to platform development and training, including crypto education.\n\n🌸 **How It Works:**\n\n[![bounties-Flow.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gcghpbtF/bounties-Flow.png)](https://postimg.cc/LhZ5kwMN)\n\nBloom’s [Local Action Rewards](https://bloomnetwork.earth/view/announcement-local-action-rewards-942c6454c17d) help record and reward your community's talent investment in local and bioregional regeneration activities, using our social networking platform and blockchain tools. It's a new way to distribute philanthropic funds and cooperative profits for grassroots mobilization.\n\nLocal Bloom hubs and their members earn FLO (Flowers), our reputation token, by documenting their regenerative actions. The public can easily read about the actions, allowing peers to learn and improve their own impact. Our grants are dispersed based on FLO earned in that period. Bloom's social network, combining features of LinkedIn, Facebook, and Discord, supports effective mobilization around what is working well for climate adaptation and repair.\n\nNext, we are exploring ways to add community currency properties to FLO to support local business discovery, further utilizing [Inverter Network's](https://github.com/InverterNetwork) smart contracts to kickstart flywheels for bioregional economies.\n\n[![community-Currency-nodescrip.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cJY52P2q/community-Currency-nodescrip.png)](https://postimg.cc/1gmHN7yM)\n\nIt's an open discussion how we collaborate with other cosmo-local networks to maximize supporting and scaling what matters. Several Local Bloom hubs are also members of their local ReFi chapter, for example. We hope this listing helps you get to know us, and please visit [https://bloomnetwork.earth](https://bloomnetwork.earth) to learn more and read recent action reports.\n\n# Goal\n**Sponsors for the rewards pool are welcome.

Italia is a pioneering collective addressing the pressing challenges of ecological decline and social disparity in Italy. Our bioregion is experiencing a rapid loss of biodiversity, coupled with economic hardship and a decline in traditional knowledge. To reverse this trend, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological restoration, community empowerment, and technological innovation.\n\nItaly's rich biodiversity and cultural heritage provide a unique canvas for our work, and we are committed to inspiring a nationwide movement towards regeneration.\n\n# Focus areas\n\n## Education and Outreach\n\nRaise awareness about regenerative practices, blockchain technology, ReFi and the potential for community-led development. By educating diverse audiences we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing our country and its ecosystems.\n\n**Specific Goals and Objectives:**\n\n- Create accessible ReFi resources and materials in Italian for different educational levels.\n- Organize workshops, seminars, and conferences to share knowledge and best practices.\n- Build a strong online presence through social media and digital platforms to reach a wider audience.\n- Build a community of ReFi practitioners and enthusiasts.\n\n**Challenges and Barriers:**\n\n- Overcoming misinformation and skepticism about regenerative practices and blockchain technology.\n- Bridging the digital divide to ensure equitable access to information and resources.\n- Engaging diverse communities with different levels of education and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n- Measuring the impact of educational initiatives on behavior change and community engagement.\n\n## Community Empowerment \n\nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration. By facilitating collaboration, leadership, and decision-making among existing local communities, we create resilient and self-sufficient regions. This focus area supports the development of community-led initiatives, strengthens social capital, and builds capacity for collective action.\n\n**Specific Goals and Objectives:**\n\n- Facilitate the formation of community-based organizations and cooperatives.\n- Provide training and mentorship to community leaders and activists.\n- Support the development of local regenerative economies.\n- Promote participatory decision-making processes and inclusive governance structures.\n- Strengthen social cohesion and community resilience through cultural and social activities.\n\n**Challenges and Barriers:**\n\n- Building trust and cooperation among community members with diverse interests and perspectives.\n- Addressing power imbalances and ensuring equitable participation in decision-making.\n- Navigating complex bureaucratic and regulatory environments.\n- Securing long-term funding for community-led initiatives.\n\n## Ecological Development\n\nRestoring ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, and implementing sustainable land-use practices. This focus area involves the implementation of projects on the ground, such as reforestation, agroforestry, and water management, while also promoting research and innovation in ecological restoration.\n\n**Specific Goals and Objectives:**\n\n- Support ecosystem restoration activities like reforestation, afforestation, and habitat restoration in Italy.\n- Promote sustainable agriculture and food systems, including organic farming and agro-ecology projects.\n- Support the implementation of water conservation and management strategies to overcome water crisis (especially in south Italy).\n- Protect biodiversity through the creation of protected areas and species conservation programs, including wildfire protection\n- Develop innovative ecological technologies and solutions.\n\n**Challenges and Barriers:**\n\n- Mitigating the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\n- Securing adequate funding for large-scale ecological restoration projects.\n- Balancing ecological restoration with the needs of local communities.\n\n# Programs & Initiatives\n\n## Support Rifai Sicilia initiatives\n[Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) is a pioneering community leading some of the most interesting on the ground initiatives related to ecological restoration and regenerative finance in the Mediterranean bioregion. Their work spans multiple fronts, including developing a practice-based eco-credit on RegenNetwork, partnering with Silvi Protocol for tree planting and reforestation initiatives, creating a community-led protocol for wildfire prevention and intervention, and fostering economic resilience through mutual credit and local currencies.\n\nWe have been unwavering supporters of Rifai Sicilia since its inception and remain committed to their mission.\n\n_Project steward: [Antonio Paglino](https://x.com/regenavocado)_\n\n## Kickstart ReFi Calabria\nCalabria, with its ancient roots, mystical landscapes, and a profound spiritual heritage, offers an extraordinary canvas for spiritual regeneration. This region, often overlooked, holds a wealth of untapped potential to reawaken the divine feminine within the land and its inhabitants.\n\n_Project steward: [Maria Falbo](https://x.com/Maria__Falbo)_\n\n## ReFi Italia Official Manifesto\nThis initiative aims to develop a comprehensive ReFi Italia Manifesto, a blueprint for Italy’s transition towards a regenerative economy. By centering on regional communities and their unique needs, we will create a framework that empowers local actors to drive sustainable development. The manifesto will serve as a catalyst for investment, innovation, and policy change, positioning Italy at the center of a bioregional regeneration process.\n\n_Project steward: [Raffaele Izzia](https://x.com/izziaraffaele)_\n\n# Additional Resources\n- [ReFi + CoFi webinar in Italian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N77Fo1RFZ2s)\n- [Rifai Sicilia 2023 Recap](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia/status/1716008422334693821)\n- [Local Node Roundup 2023](https://mirror.xyz/refidao.eth/pzwS5ape0Zqu5mnqKM60eIqMfBtLjQ18UEy1jiDeAHU#heading-refi-italia--rifai-sicilia)","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"ReFi_Italia"},"recipient":"0xa520D9dE41cAD5d553Ec35805B4DF2F2d01691A4"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreifshszfkp62fb5tpuvzwr6geu5si6hrlt2llhhdi75pbbw5siy3fy","projects":[{"name":"ReFi Italia","id":"0x00d0a7de37e0380691919dcfdff351f1ffe484e2cef44413212a8b4278c55dfc","metadata":{"title":"ReFi Italia","logoImg":"bafkreidcj5tz6zmx2yvdr2maq7cejp57h3hzfjzhbo3z32sohvchrouzkq","website":"https://linktr.ee/refi_italia","bannerImg":"bafkreibhebagd6r7z3syhdlnuav36k422cxkd7ig4s3qq7tze56eu6u6ja","createdAt":1722891312393,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..dMUj9EopxqMpGHRWV4x8ury1tgawuIe2UllN78_rdKKv7KuntpIeORFtiLUT6D3zmVDK8W2CRx0WqeA1bI0ACw","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-05T20:49:21.050Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-05T20:49:21.050Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-03T20:49:21.050Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xa520D9dE41cAD5d553Ec35805B4DF2F2d01691A4","hash":"v0.0.0:ggR0MXfzOqAWw3jPIAn8/FsUJID8/3rubWXyBr/6S8o=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#ReFi_Italia"}}},"description":"ReFi Italia is a network-driven initiative dedicated to tackle ecological and social challenges through innovative technology and grassroots initiatives. Over the past few years, we've focused on building the foundational infrastructure for regenerative development across Italian bioregions. Our vision for 2025 and beyond is to amplify our achievements through focused education, strategic network expansion, and tangible ecological restoration projects, creating a blueprint for similar Mediterranean regions.  \n  \n# Focus areas  \n  \n## Education and Outreach  \n  \nWe work to raise awareness about regenerative practices, blockchain technology, and community-led development. By educating diverse audiences, we foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities shaping Italy’s ecosystems.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_\n- Hosted two online workshops on mutual credit protocols, featuring [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) and [Cycles.money](https://x.com/cyclesmoney).  \n- Led an in-person training session on commitment pooling during [Rifai Sicilia](https://x.com/RifaiSicilia) Week.  \n- Participated in key Italian web3 events, including [ETHNA](https://x.com/ethna_rocks), [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome), [Digitalia Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsXeGs-cJs&ab_channel=UrbeETH), and [Apical Days Palermo](https://www.instagram.com/apical_org/p/DBi5QpLsUyd/).  \n  \n## Community Empowerment  \n  \nEmpowering local communities is at the core of ReFi Italia's approach to regeneration. We facilitate collaboration, leadership, and decision-making among existing networks, fostering self-sufficiency and resilience. Through community-led initiatives, we build social capital and empower collective action.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_  \n- In partnership with Rifai Sicilia and Grassroots Economics, we launched a mutual credit [pilot project](https://sarafu.network/pools/0xb792Ea4BBd378a03463a05A8A91bbBfD0Acd5687), exploring alternative economic models to support local resilience and community-driven economic development.  \n  \n## Ecological Development  \n  \nWe promote ecosystems restoration, biodiversity protection, and sustainable land-use practices by providing resources, knowledge and capital to local regenerative projects that create impact on-the-ground.  \n  \n_Recent Highlights:_ \nIn 2024, we sponsored a [Permaculture Design Course](https://www.instagram.com/associazioneboscoangimbe/p/DFcpyptu3dC/) at Bosco Angimbè (Trapani), training 22 participants in advanced ecological practices. The program directly contributed to ecosystem restoration with 60 supporting plant species introduced and 30 tree planted by participants of the course in collaboration with local ecological experts to ensure the preservation of native ecosystem characteristics.  \n  \n# 2025 Strategic Objectives  \n  \n## Expanding Education & Capacity Building  \n  \nIn 2025, we’ll enhance both digital and in-person educational resources, develop specialized training programs for different community sectors, and create accessible content on regenerative practices to broaden our impact.  \n  \n## Strengthening the Network  \n  \nWe aim to deepen connections with the global ReFi/Web3 ecosystem and Italian ReFi nodes, support grassroots initiatives across multiple regions, and build leadership

If we want to build regenerative systems and address the climate crisis effectively, we need everyone involved in the solution design process.\n\nWe are evolving the web3 space by:\n\n- **Bringing in expertise** from sectors outside of web3 to broaden the regen movement\n- Providing an avenue for innovative web3 projects to conduct research and receive **rapid feedback** outside of their bubble\n- Designing events with high-quality interaction, and safe spaces for experimentation to **co-create web3 projects with local regens.**\n- **Driving inclusivity and diversity in web3** through curated attendance, using application processes & scholarships\n- **Creating toolkits and media** to elevate project stories, educate on the regen movement, and inspire new groups to get involved\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-14 at 8.36.29 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WnhShlC.png)\n\n\n---\n\n\n![Where we're going.svg](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F668b2193-8cb7-4aaa-834b-1fdd24fe4a81%2FWhere_were_going.svg?table=block&id=b7dc65be-6e9e-4256-9dda-66428992dcb9&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nRegens Unite was born in May 2022 with a seed event in Brussels. Since then we have initiated **18 events** in different locations, grown a **Telegram group of 700+ regens**, and formed **a small, distributed team** passionate about advancing a regenerative future.\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of requests from event organizers across the world to grow the movement, and we are continuing to build a platform to connect regens with learnings, resources, and mutual support.\n\n**Thank you in advance for your support.

Educational Media and Storytelling Platform 🎥**\n\n**Recorded Content**: we are publishing recorded event sessions from our digital webinars, 1-1 project interviews, and after-movies from our last events.\n\n**Community Showcase**: A discovery hub for ReFi and climate-focused communities in Web3. The next version will spotlight impactful projects, useful tools, supportive networks, onboarding resources, and key builders.\n\n# **3. A Collaborative Regen Ecosystem 🤝**\n\n**Toolkits for Event Organizers:** We’ll support organizers to host events under or with Regens Unite branding, as a response to ongoing interest in gatherings focused on ReFi, Web3, climate, activism, art, and more.\n\n**Media Partnerships and Regen Alliances:** Regenerative development requires collaboration over competition, so we’re brewing an alliance of community-building initiatives across the web3 ecosystem. We are also organically expanding our impact and reach through aligned storytelling partnerships.\n\n---\n\n![](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F03e3e609-0541-48a4-9976-280b7e65b737%2FWhat_Regens_Unite_is_bringing_to_web3.svg?table=block&id=caf641bc-7377-465b-9c3d-9421562d02be&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 needs more diversity and more expertise to achieve true systems change at a global scale. If we want to build regenerative systems and address the climate crisis effectively, we need everyone involved in the solution design process.\n\nWe are evolving the web3 space by:\n\n- **Bringing in expertise** from sectors outside of web3 to broaden the regen movement\n- Providing an avenue for innovative web3 projects to conduct research and receive **rapid feedback** outside of their bubble\n- Designing events with high-quality interaction, and safe spaces for experimentation to **co-create web3 projects with local regens.**\n- **Driving inclusivity and diversity in web3** through curated attendance, using application processes & scholarships\n- **Creating toolkits and media** to elevate project stories, educate on the regen movement, and inspire new groups to get involved\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WnhShlC.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://regensunite.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407%2F668b2193-8cb7-4aaa-834b-1fdd24fe4a81%2FWhere_were_going.svg?table=block&id=b7dc65be-6e9e-4256-9dda-66428992dcb9&spaceId=7bc385fa-917d-4c6b-af2b-58bba8eaf407&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of requests from event organizers across the world to grow the movement, and we are continuing to build a platform to connect regens with learnings, resources, and mutual support.\n\n**Thank you in advance for your support.

About the chapter\n\nAs a chapter of the [GreenPill Network](https://greenpill.network/), GreenPill India is committed to converging regenerative digital infrastructure with grassroots efforts in India to drive local outcomes for global problems in coordination. With a population of 1.4 billion, India holds a massive opportunity to unlock the gains from combining coordination mechanisms to drive local outcomes for global problems.\n\n# Who are we\n\nWe are an assembly of ReFi founders, designers, engineers, writers, and web3 enthusiasts who were busy in our rabbit holes until most of us met each other at various points since early 2022 when the book GreenPilled launched the meme of regenerative crypto-economics into the world. While each of us has been striving in our primary role to revive public goods in our projects, in our individual and collective capacity, we have been championing the need to fund, design, develop, and market a future rooted in regeneration.\n\n# Milestones in last 12 months\n\n-   June 2024: Establish a partnership with a retainer contract with a local biodiversity farm, [Nature Inspires](https://www.facebook.com/NIChiguruecospace/), based near Bangalore, to drive immersive educational experiences on actionable insights for eco-friendly sustainable living\n\n-   March 2024: Conducted a [half-day community visit](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/farm-visit) to Nature Inspires farm, Chiguru Ecospace, to bridge the world of web3 enthusiasts, builders, and thinkers with the grassroots wisdom of sustainable living.\n\n-   March 2024: Designed and delivered a [2-day workshop on DAOs](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/dao) for faculty at Punjabi University Centre for Emerging and Innovative Technology\n\n-   February 2024: Conducted [workshop on understanding and applying quadratic voting](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/qv) for collective decision-making\n\n-   December 2023: Conducted session on [Role of Crypto in Public Goods](https://x.com/Atlantis_p2p/status/1731932427554116074) at [Interfaces](https://lu.ma/interfaces) Unconference at the Indian Institute of Science\n\n-   Through the year, we have published educational articles on our online publication [Gulshan](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india) on topics such as:\n\n    -   [navigating challenges for regen founders](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/navigating-regen-movement)\n    -   [the role of inquiry in regen's future](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/role-of-inquiry)\n    -   [inspirations from nature for mechanism design](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/mechanism-design)\n    -   [the legacy of the Chipko Movement in India](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/chipko)\n    -   [key takeaways for India from the GreenPill book](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/programmable-money)\n\n# Challenges\n\nOur ongoing challenge is community building. So far, all the activities have been driven by the core team. We are planning to scale the operations using the Impact Miner app, which can reward volunteers and contributors for their actions using the grant funding and, in return, help codify their impact onchain.\n\n# Wins\n\nThe most rewarding part of running the chapter activities is introducing the affordances of blockchain technology to non-crypto audiences and explaining how the Lego blocks stack together for new solutions for some of the most complex challenges, from funding open-source software to climate action.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex004/uploads/greenpill_hub/original/1X/d3ba63086425101831b109d3d4d76ea9a746bd0e.avif)\n\n# Path Forward\n\nGreenPill India aspires to create spaces where dialogues can flourish and debates can be hosted to bring code and culture together to challenge the status quo and build plural pathways for an equitable future.\n\nThe core team will continue to offer their time for the chapter with no expectation of compensation.

With a population of 1.4 billion, India holds a massive opportunity to unlock the gains from combining coordination mechanisms to drive local outcomes for global problems.\n\n# Who are we\n\nWe are an assembly of ReFi founders, designers, engineers, writers, and web3 enthusiasts who were busy in our rabbit holes until most of us met each other at various points since early 2022 when the book GreenPilled launched the meme of regenerative crypto-economics into the world. While each of us has been striving in our primary role to revive public goods in our projects, in our individual and collective capacity, we have been championing the need to fund, design, develop, and market a future rooted in regeneration.\n\n# Activities\n\n- Throughout the year, we have published educational articles on our online publication [Gulshan](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india) on topics such as:\n\n    -   [navigating challenges for regen founders](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/navigating-regen-movement)\n    -   [the role of inquiry in regen's future](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/role-of-inquiry)\n    -   [inspirations from nature for mechanism design](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/mechanism-design)\n    -   [the legacy of the Chipko Movement in India](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/chipko)\n    -   [key takeaways for India from the GreenPill book](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/programmable-money)\n\n-   June 2024: Establish a partnership with a retainer contract with a local biodiversity farm, [Nature Inspires](https://www.facebook.com/NIChiguruecospace/), based near Bangalore, to drive immersive educational experiences on actionable insights for eco-friendly sustainable living\n\n-   March 2024: Conducted a [half-day community visit](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/farm-visit) to Nature Inspires farm, Chiguru Ecospace, to bridge the world of web3 enthusiasts, builders, and thinkers with the grassroots wisdom of sustainable living.\n\n-   March 2024: Designed and delivered a [2-day workshop on DAOs](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/dao) for faculty at Punjabi University Centre for Emerging and Innovative Technology\n\n-   February 2024: Conducted [workshop on understanding and applying quadratic voting](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/qv) for collective decision-making\n\n-   December 2023: Conducted session on [Role of Crypto in Public Goods](https://x.com/Atlantis_p2p/status/1731932427554116074) at [Interfaces](https://lu.ma/interfaces) Unconference at the Indian Institute of Science\n\n# Challenges\n\nOur ongoing challenge is community building. So far, all the activities have been driven by the core team. We are planning to scale the operations using the Impact Miner app, which can reward volunteers and contributors for their actions using the grant funding and, in return, help codify their impact onchain.\n\n# Wins\n\nThe most rewarding part of running the chapter activities is introducing the affordances of blockchain technology to non-crypto audiences and explaining how the Lego blocks stack together for new solutions for some of the most complex challenges, from funding open-source software to climate action.\n\n![](https://paragraph.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F47b00ad1fad236ffb3294b062f23fcfc.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\n\n# Path Forward\n\nGreenPill India aspires to create spaces where dialogues can flourish and debates can be hosted to bring code and culture together to challenge the status quo and build plural pathways for an equitable future.\n\nThe core team will continue to offer their time for the chapter with no expectation of compensation. We want to enable funding for volunteers and contributors who drive action on the ground. For this purpose, we will utilize the capital allocation workflow using the Impact Miner app from Atlantis.\nWe will continue using residual and new funds raised for the following:\n\n-   Upcoming focus: Expand the core group's subject matter expertise to new community members and enable them to scale independent projects, events, and activities\n-   Use of funds: Cost of logistics to host events.

This lack of understanding hinders local adoption of innovative technologies and sustainable practices.\n## Our Solution\nWe address this issue by:\n- **Providing hands-on training** for setting up wallets and navigating Web3 interfaces.\n- **Guiding users through the Celo network**, chosen for its alignment with our sustainability vision.\n- **Deploying equity tokens and a DAO on Celo** to enable community co-ownership of sustainable projects and inclusive decision-making.\n## Impact on the Celo Ecosystem\nOur project is designed to:\n- Expand the Celo user base in The Hague.\n- Increase the number of transactions and wallet usage within the local community.\n- Drive the growth and integration of Celo in real-world, sustainable applications.\n## Our Journey\n### January 2020\n- Registered BT Equity & Viable Equity to manage tokenized sustainable projects.\n- Registered Viable Community to support volunteer-driven sustainability and obtained ANBI status as a Public Benefit Organization.\n- Adapted our legal framework to a steward-ownership model.\n- Despite setbacks with pilot projects due to licensing issues, we continued to progress.\n### March 2024\n- Established ReFi The Hague as a local node during the ReFi DAO incubator program.\n### August 2024\n- Apply for GG21 Genesis and Real World Builders rounds.\n- Continue developing on the Celo platform, hiring experts from the ReFi network, and cross-pollinating with other nodes and Web3 projects globally and locally.\n### September 2024\n- Map out The Hague’s Web3 space and establish connections.\n- Finalize the legal setup for steward-ownership and DAO integration.\n- Host our first educational event and publish our whitepaper and explanatory videos.\n### October 2024\n- Deploy Volunteer Interface 1.0.\n- Launch the community marketplace.\n- Mint equity tokens to support local sustainable projects.\n### November 2024\n- Launch the DAO and commence our AgriVoltaic pilot project.\n## Focus Areas\n### Community Building\n- Engage The Hague’s residents by offering opportunities to contribute time, skills, and resources toward sustainability.\n- Grow the ReFi The Hague community from 4 to 20 members and attract 100+ volunteers through local events and the Volunteer The Hague platform.\n### Web3 Integration\n- Receive expert input on our whitepaper from Web3 experts within the ReFi and Celo communities.\n- Finalize and launch equity tokens and a community marketplace.\n- Develop a DAO and additional (soulbound) tokens to facilitate transparent decision-making and empower community ownership.\n### Web3 Awareness\n- Educate 100+ local volunteers on Web3 through monthly training sessions and informative content on our YouTube channel.\n### Collaborative Projects\n- Launch our collaborative AgriVoltaics pilot project, allowing community members to co-own and benefit from sustainable food and energy production.\n## Programs\n### Volunteer Program\n- Host volunteer coffee meetups to engage with new and existing volunteers from The Hague.\n- Launch the Volunteer Portal 1.0, providing access to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, ClickUp, Figma, Canva, tutorials, and relevant documentation.\n- Hold a strategic/governance meeting to establish OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and timeline.\n### Educational Program\n- Host our first open educational event.\n- Launch a YouTube channel to explain Web3 concepts and their relevance to our community.\n### Sustainable Investment Program\n- Mint and deploy the first 1,000 equity tokens on the Celo network, backed by €1,000 in the holding’s bank account.\n- Deploy the marketplace, allocating €500 to stock it with sustainable items and services, and another €500 to the liquidity pool for token sales.\n- Test the marketplace by distributing 500 tokens to volunteers as a reward for their contributions.\n## Challenges & Opportunities\nOur main challenge lies in setting up Web3 tools, integrating them with real-life projects, and engaging local supporters in decision-making. However, The Hague's international, forward-thinking population and our established volunteer base position us for success.\n## Support Us\nTo complete this stage of our Web3 development, we are seeking between €2,500 and €50,000 to cover expenses for expert advice, reviews, development tools, and deployment. These funds will flow back into the ReFi and Celo ecosystems, helping us finalize our infrastructure and operations with valuable input from within these networks.\n## Key Milestones\n- Finalized legal framework for steward-ownership, tokenization, and decision-making via DAO, connecting the NGO, Holding, and SPV.\n- Completed development of Web3 tools (Tokens and DAO).\n- Live local educational events.\n```\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"Viable-Community","projectTwitter":"refithehague"},"recipient":"0x783bb983ca298246C8E24BCF7621286f3456624E"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreid3w74idlc7zuvc7uxla3kwcnz4tu4dsealv5oszhmgpugdvywphi","projects":[{"name":"ReFi The Hague Activation","id":"0xbd227a9489c391bef8decc01fd0710c6ae4001a77bce121fe5d0a4f676af7c18","metadata":{"title":"ReFi The Hague Activation","logoImg":"bafkreidc34b4qzsbzvgs5p63yna23mwrzf3kszsy4mh6uzj6tnywsasibu","website":"https://ReFiTheHague.org","bannerImg":"bafkreihxn7lzd3pqvy7enkag3ih35vdbwlaujmdznez3qj75cwx4my475m","createdAt":1723034065029,"userGithub":"vinviable","credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"jws":"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..j-d0CdHGAy1ZKNWDv47mGcCgJL-1LkDWqcmx1h_-uxz5nC7uWD3bP6f3qLhrhXN3X2isSAjnUt7Rt9fqR1MrDQ","type":"Ed25519Signature2018","created":"2024-08-07T12:33:00.885Z","proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC"},"issuer":"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2024-08-07T12:33:00.885Z","expirationDate":"2024-11-05T12:33:00.885Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xb2C345Fa0883452226d7C2a444FE3d6656dD91ea","hash":"v0.0.0:jRaELwE5CuJ5ouaQmMUTe2qVNkmDzIwrH7dMpWiPC30=","@context":[{"hash":"https://schema.org/Text","provider":"https://schema.org/Text"}],"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#refithehague"}}},"description":"ReFi The Hague is a grassroots initiative bringing the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and the power of Web3 to the people of The Hague.\nOur mission is to foster a regenerative, community-owned economy by creating tools, infrastructure, and learning opportunities that empower residents to co-create sustainable futures.\n\nWe’re building a local ecosystem where people can:\n\n♻️ Transact regeneratively through a community marketplace.\n\n🌱 Learn to use Web3 tools through hands-on, inclusive education.\n\n🌞 Co-own regenerative projects via equity tokens and DAO governance.\n\n🤝 Collaborate on real-world solutions like AgriVoltaics and circular economy initiatives.\n\nWe use the Celo blockchain and a steward-ownership legal model to ensure that value created within the community benefits the community.\n\n🎯 2025 Objectives & Milestones\n✅ 1.

It was founded by nature lovers to create a positive impact on the planet.\n\nWe are NOT another carbon credits based organization! We aim on delivering real, tangible ecological impact.\n\n**🔴Problems Addressed**\n\n1. The global environmental crisis, characterized by unprecedented levels of biodiversity loss, deforestation, climate change, soil degradation, and other challenges, poses a pressing issue for humanity.\n\n2. Traditional fundraising methods often suffer from issues such as lack of transparency, high operating costs, and a lack of trust, which can limit the effectiveness of efforts to address these challenges.\n\n❗Lack of transparency and trust - It can be difficult for donors to know how their donations are being used, how much was used for Impact vs. Operations, etc.\n\n❗Middlemen and overhead cost - A portion of donations may be used to cover operational and administrative expenses.\n\n❗Potential for fraud - There have been many cases of charity organizations misusing funds or being outright scams.\n\n❗Limited control - Once a donation is made, the donor typically has no further say in how the funds are used or distributed.\n\n❗Limited or no connection with impact generated - Once a donation is made, the donor typically isn’t made aware of the actual impact generated by their generosity.\n\n**💡 Our Solution**\n\n✅We designed a platform that connects the donor with the impact generated by their generosity that provides full transparency and accessibility to track all donations and contributions to the Anu Initiative’s Treasury all the way to Actual Impact generated by our trusty Impact Partners.\n\n✅By integrating these solutions, Anu Initiative can help overcome the traditional challenges of environmental fundraising and create a robust, transparent, and effective mechanism for environmental impact.\n\n✅Blockchain Technology for Transparency - Utilize blockchain tech to track donations from the moment they are made until they are spent, and moreover, all the way down to the impact generated. This ensures that donors can see exactly where their money is going and how it is being used, addressing the transparency and trust issues.\n\n✅Direct Impact Tracking - Develop a system that connects donations to specific projects and outcomes in a live manner. For each project funded, there should be a clear set of expected results, and donors and the public should receive reports on the project's progress and impact. Funded projects should be displayed on a public dashboard.\n\n✅Reduce Overhead with Technology - Automate various administrative and operational tasks using software to reduce the need for middlemen and cut down on overhead costs. This allows a larger portion of donations to go directly to environmental projects.\n\n✅Engagement and Feedback Loop - Create a platform where donors can vote on projects they want to support, providing them with control over how their donations are used and fostering a deeper connection with the impact generated.\n\n✅Impact Investment Fund - Establish a fund to invest in startups and technologies that provide ecological benefits, with profits being reinvested into the Anu Initiative’s projects.\n\n✅Feedback and Adaptation - Implement a feedback mechanism where donors, partners, and beneficiaries can suggest improvements to the Anu Initiative’s processes, ensuring that the organization remains responsive and adaptable to the needs of the environment and its stakeholders.\n\n**🌱Roadmap:**\n\n**Administrative:**\n1.

description**\n\nWe are the Green Pill Local Chapter of Côte d'Ivoire (GreenPill CIV), founded on 20/06/2024. We are dedicated to promoting inclusive development through technology and effective collaboration among people from all sectors of Ivorian society to carry out regenerative projects.\nOur mission is to promote and implement actions and technological tools within local communities to address environmental and social challenges in Côte d'Ivoire, adopting a collaborative and regenerative approach. We focus on:\n\n- Popularizing and taking ownership of social issues by promoting education and access to information to fight against inequalities.\n\n- Raising awareness and combating environmental issues such as pollution of natural and urban areas and reforestation in rural areas.\n\n- Encouraging and facilitating cooperation among stakeholders for local action through technological tools such as social media, blockchain, and AI.\n\nIn summary, we aim to implement sustainable and innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for the populations of Ivorian localities through regenerative technologies and the tools offered by the crypto-economy, with a perspective of inclusive development.\n\nIn the Ivorian context, where Web 3 and blockchain are often seen solely through the lens of speculation, it seemed necessary, before taking any action, to raise local awareness on topics related to inclusive development and regenerative crypto-economy. Furthermore, we needed a base of individuals likely to join our Chapter.\nThus, we launched the community “Habitants d’Internet”, in english “Internet Dwellers.” This community aims to connect members, facilitate discussions on current and societal issues, and ultimately foster collective action that will impact our society.\n\n**Main project: Habitants d'internet V2**\n\nOur community was created in June as a debate platform on WhatsApp voice chat. Within a few weeks and through several debates, we successfully gathered more than 200 Dwellers.\nHowever, the success of the platform has presented several challenges. The first is WhatsApp's limit, which restricts the number of participants in a discussion group to 32 people simultaneously. While this has not prevented us from gathering nearly 50 people in audio after each debate, this limit hinders active community participation.\nMoreover, having discussed with several members, we found that many are eager to contribute to Green Pill CIV's impact mission.\nIn response to these challenges, we have thought of a solution:\nTransform Habitant d’Internet into a Startup Society. This means creating a digital community model designed to provide real-world value and reward the most active members. This Startup Society will be a means to unite members around impactful projects, test governance models, and offer community benefits (from our partners and technologically).\nTo do that, we decided to move from WhatsApp to Telegram, adopting the benefits of the TON blockchain to enhance our connectivity and engagement. However, we needed a way to recognize and reward the efforts of our members who work tirelessly towards our common goals.\nIn this context, the idea of $DJAI was born. Named after the vibrant spirit of the “Habitant d’Internet”, $DJAI is not just a token but a symbol of recognition and encouragement of community action. It embodies our collective commitment to making a social impact through the power of Web3 technologies.\n$DJAI is designed to reward members for actions that align with our community’s mission. Whether it's organizing a local event, leading a discussion on a crucial topic, or developing a beneficial project for society, each impactful action deserves $DJAI tokens.\nWhat makes $DJAI unique is its focus on empowerment rather than profit.

We are dedicated to promoting inclusive development through technology and effective collaboration among people from all sectors of Ivorian society to carry out regenerative projects.\nOur mission is to promote and implement actions and technological tools within local communities to address environmental and social challenges in Côte d'Ivoire, adopting a collaborative and regenerative approach. We focus on:\n\n- Popularizing and taking ownership of social issues by promoting education and access to information to fight against inequalities.\n\n- Raising awareness and combating environmental issues such as pollution of natural and urban areas and reforestation in rural areas.\n\n- Encouraging and facilitating cooperation among stakeholders for local action through technological tools such as social media, blockchain, and AI.\n\nIn summary, we aim to implement sustainable and innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for the populations of Ivorian localities through regenerative technologies and the tools offered by the crypto-economy, with a perspective of inclusive development.\n\nIn the Ivorian context, where Web 3 and blockchain are often seen solely through the lens of speculation, it seemed necessary, before taking any action, to raise local awareness on topics related to inclusive development and regenerative crypto-economy. Furthermore, we needed a base of individuals likely to join our Chapter.\nThus, we launched the community “Habitants d’Internet”, in english “Internet Dwellers.” This community aims to connect members, facilitate discussions on current and societal issues, and ultimately foster collective action that will impact our society.\n\n**Main project: Habitants d'internet V2**\n\nOur community was created in June as a debate platform on WhatsApp voice chat. Within a few weeks and through several debates, we successfully gathered more than 200 Dwellers.\nHowever, the success of the platform has presented several challenges. The first is WhatsApp's limit, which restricts the number of participants in a discussion group to 32 people simultaneously. While this has not prevented us from gathering nearly 50 people in audio after each debate, this limit hinders active community participation.\nMoreover, having discussed with several members, we found that many are eager to contribute to Green Pill CIV's impact mission.\nIn response to these challenges, we have thought of a solution:\nTransform Habitant d’Internet into a Startup Society. This means creating a digital community model designed to provide real-world value and reward the most active members. This Startup Society will be a means to unite members around impactful projects, test governance models, and offer community benefits (from our partners and technologically).\nTo do that, we decided to move from WhatsApp to Telegram, adopting the benefits of the TON blockchain to enhance our connectivity and engagement. However, we needed a way to recognize and reward the efforts of our members who work tirelessly towards our common goals.\nIn this context, the idea of $DJAI was born. Named after the vibrant spirit of the “Habitant d’Internet”, $DJAI is not just a token but a symbol of recognition and encouragement of community action. It embodies our collective commitment to making a social impact through the power of Web3 technologies.\n$DJAI is designed to reward members for actions that align with our community’s mission. Whether it's organizing a local event, leading a discussion on a crucial topic, or developing a beneficial project for society, each impactful action deserves $DJAI tokens.\nWhat makes $DJAI unique is its focus on empowerment rather than profit. Holders of $DJAI tokens will enjoy exclusive benefits within our network and with our partners. Imagine receiving discounts on educational courses, gaining early access to innovative technological solutions, or even having a voice in community decision-making processes. $DJAI makes these possibilities real.\nOur Vision for $DJAI is simple yet profound: to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every member’s contribution is valued and rewarded. $DJAI will serve as the cornerstone of this ecosystem, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

The incubator program. The Celo Africa DAO has established an incubator program to nurture and support early-stage projects built on the Celo blockchain. This program provides entrepreneurs and developers with the necessary resources, mentorship, and funding opportunities to transform their innovative ideas into fully functional dApps. The incubator focuses on projects that align with Celo's mission of financial inclusion and sustainability, helping to expand the ecosystem by fostering the next generation of impactful blockchain solutions in Africa. These projects are further recommended to Celo Camp for further scaling and development. Some of our cohort graduates have launched on Minipay.\n\n2. Developer Talent. To drive innovation and growth within the Celo ecosystem, the Celo Africa DAO places a strong emphasis on attracting, developing, and retaining top developer talent. The DAO organizes monthly code jams (technical workshops), mini-hackathons, and workshops aimed at equipping developers with the skills needed to build dApps on the Celo platform. By creating a robust pipeline of skilled developers, the DAO ensures that the Celo ecosystem has the technical expertise necessary to scale and evolve, particularly in the African context where local solutions are most impactful. Additionally, these monthly code jams have been supporting BWC(build with Celo) hackathons to get the most out of them, and the results and metrics have been impressive. Most of the promising projects are forwarded to the incubator program and Celo Camp\n\n3.  Community Awareness & Brand Visibility. Celo Africa DAO actively works to raise awareness of the Celo brand and its mission across Africa. To amplify Celo's presence, the DAO has partnered with and sponsored major Web3 events across the continent. These high-profile events provide a platform to showcase Celo’s innovative solutions to a wider audience, including developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts. By being visible on these big stages, Celo Africa DAO not only increases adoption of the Celo platform but also positions Celo as a key player in the African Web3 landscape. This strategy strengthens the ecosystem's reputation and fosters a deeper connection with the community, driving engagement and advocacy for Celo's mission of financial inclusion and social impact.\n\nOur roadmap for the Q3 & Q4 2024 will include:\n1.  Expanding Community Engagement i.e. Community Events & Meetups, University Partnerships, and Sponsorship of Major Web3 Conferences:\n2. Strengthening Developer Talent & Ecosystem Growth i.e. Hackathons & Innovation Challenges\n3.  Incubating and Scaling Impactful Projects i.e. Incubator Cohorts and Ecosystem Collaboration.\n","hidden":false,"question":"If applicable, describe how your project/community has been utilising or supporting the Celo ecosystem, or explain a roadmap for your plans to utilise, build with, or align with Celo.","questionId":4},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you (or other key members of your team) joined the Regen Coordi-Nation Community Telegram group? --> https://t.me/+dfOMYhMROdU5YzY0","questionId":5},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you followed @RegenCoordinate on X (Twitter)? --> https://x.com/RegenCoordinate","questionId":6}],"project":{"id":"0x358b849a8a89e33c7bda1b1e31b85f4354ca185bbf913119fd977678cbc6060c","title":"Celo Africa DAO","logoImg":"bafkreigqtdocw73z47khsw2q3ioaeikcfe3bqggivliivih4lcjnldpfc4","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreidlqf6rrbtsgwhcjmec3yjav2fdpmxifv63vuuz7ey7upws6zengi","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://www.celoafricadao.xyz/","bannerImg":"bafkreigaw6wpzuj2izihkinecbi5b3nh2j4rpceozhujw3yd6vjnkezxmu","createdAt":1723475921640,"userGithub":"Celo-Africa-DAO","credentials":{},"description":"Celo Africa DAO is a community of builders and developers committed to advancing the growth and adoption of the CELO blockchain across Africa. \n\nCelo Africa DAO's focus is centred on three main areas:\n1.

Europe. We deployed resources such as the [Celo EU website](https://www.celodao.eu/), which attracted 5000+ visits, created a [Celo Ecosystem Report,](https://docsend.com/view/yrb3tzt9kepfc38r) and published 10+ hours of high-quality videos, including a mini-documentary. CELO EU co-hosted 14 events with 2,000+ attendees, represented Celo, and spoke at 25+ events. Through our 3 co-programs (RefiDAO, Take Off & Casa Celo) - we engaged 100+ builders. Besides this, we’ve also kickstarted the Celo Governance Development Sprint. Our efficient management of Season 0’s budget enabled us to return 27% surplus funds of 120,000 CELO to the community fund. \n\nIn Season 1 (February ‘24 - June '24), We’ve doubled down on the successful elements of Season 0. We launched a community-led conference to shape the future of Celo by bringing together 150 key stakeholders in Berlin. Alongside this, we've supported more than 5+ European meetups hosted 2 meetups attracting 150+ attendees. We are planning further collaboration at ETHCC ‘24 by dedicating a track for Public Goods and highlighting projects that contribute to the ecosystem. In addition to this, we’ve represented Celo during ETHGlobal, DAS, ETHDam, and about 15+ side events while creating content for this experience. We’ve also developed 2 scripts for a mini-documentary, which are being produced. We’ve also assisted Casa Celo Madrid in hosting 2 events with around 70+ participants. To focus on growing our BD efforts, we’ve connected with around 25+ investors and are enhancing our database to 100+ high-quality entries. Lastly, we’ve contributed to creating a startup database for CeloPG containing 150+ \noperational startups.\n\nIn season 2 (July 2024 - December 2024), Celo EU will accelerate Celo’s growth through Events and Community Development, Ecosystem Support, and Content Production and Storytelling. We will organize an online Celo Gather event, sponsor four local European events, and support Celo Africa DAO and KohCelo at ETH Safari and DevCon. We'll host three online workshops on MiCA, CEL2, and the Superchain ecosystem. Our ecosystem support includes creating three educational resources, expanding our investor database by 20 entries, and exploring institutional collaborations. Content production will feature two new Builder’s Story episodes on Minipay, a mini-series at EthSafari, a documentary at DevCon, and after-movies highlighting Celo's role at these events to record eight videos throughout H2. We aim to drive growth, solidify partnerships, and support the community’s vision.","hidden":false,"question":"If applicable, describe how your project/community has been utilising or supporting the Celo ecosystem, or explain a roadmap for your plans to utilise, build with, or align with Celo.","questionId":4},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you (or other key members of your team) joined the Regen Coordi-Nation Community Telegram group? --> https://t.me/+dfOMYhMROdU5YzY0","questionId":5},{"type":"multiple-choice","answer":"Yes","hidden":true,"question":"Have you followed @RegenCoordinate on X (Twitter)? --> https://x.com/RegenCoordinate","questionId":6}],"project":{"id":"0x51a40dbc25a3d6dbb40cf7b3de084233e241607e12fa15d3e477b6e22514efd3","title":"Celo Europe DAO","logoImg":"bafkreihaet5xc2fjabv6ykqnao3oxurvtjocuyygkmlzjd4pilnrgcrg7y","metaPtr":{"pointer":"bafkreiagrh6vg4rqyu2fveihltretvjjw6epxhnkhtoidtbxfkteg6meym","protocol":"undefined"},"website":"https://www.celodao.eu/","bannerImg":"bafkreiga22hzyjubt2fp7e7nnmfdnucw57n3qhxat5rillxieg72kcmhgy","createdAt":1722941573976,"credentials":{},"description":"Celo Europe DAO was established in 2023 to accelerate the Celo ecosystem in Europe by supporting mission-driven entrepreneurs and creators.

NYC is a New York based Greenpill Chapter focused on galvanizing support to run local quadratic funding rounds to fund irl public goods. We [host meetups most months](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/greenpill-nyc?tab=updates) to bring the community together to explore public goods funding, onchain coordination mechanisms, what people are building/exploring, etc.\n\nOur primary initiative is setting up a QF round to fund local impactors in NYC. As of now it looks like our focus will be within Red Hook, Brooklyn but we're still researching the tech stack, scope and broader plan. \n\nEverything raised this round will be used to fund the matching pool. We have all the funds from GG21 Regen Coordination Genesis in our treasury, including the USDGLO still Auto-PGF'ing, also earmarked for the matching pool.\n\nAnybody in New York should hop in our [telegram](https://t.co/8mUTGYOw9Y). \n\nAppreciate your support

I witnessed firsthand how Celo's stablecoins and accessible platform empowered coffee farming communities, fostering financial inclusion and sustainable development.\n\nCasa CELO Q1 2024 Initiatives: As a co-creator of these initiatives, I was instrumental in promoting Celo adoption and community building. These efforts strengthened the Celo ecosystem in Madrid, Barcelona, and beyond.\n\nReFi Madrid & Celo Team Engagement:  My involvement in the inaugural ReFi Madrid initiative and my consistent engagement with the Celo team demonstrate my dedication to the Celo ecosystem's growth and its focus on regenerative finance.\n\nSocialFi Polis Challenge & Celo Alignment\n\nCelo Polis is deeply intertwined with the Celo ecosystem:\n\nCelo Blockchain Integration: The entire game is built on the Celo blockchain, leveraging its speed, low fees, and mobile-first accessibility. This ensures that even users with limited resources can participate and benefit from the platform.\nCelo: Celo tokens and stablecoins (cUSD) are integrated into the game's economy, serving as the primary currency for transactions, rewards, and investments. This promotes the adoption and real-world use of Celo's native stablecoins.\nCommunity-Driven Initiatives: CeloPolis encourages participants to propose and implement projects that address real needs within the Celo ecosystem. This fosters innovation and empowers community members to actively contribute to Celo's growth.\nEducational Focus: The gamified learning platform educates users about Celo's unique features, such as its focus on mobile accessibility, sustainability, and social impact. This helps to raise awareness and understanding of Celo's potential.\n\nRoadmap for Future Utilization & Collaboration:\n\nCelo Developer Tools Integration: Explore deeper integration with Celo's developer tools and resources to facilitate the creation and deployment of Celo-based applications within the CeloPolis ecosystem, thanks to Celo Camp orientation.\nCollaboration with Celo Projects & DAOs: Forge partnerships with existing Celo projects and DAOs to create synergies, cross-promote initiatives, and expand the platform's reach and impact, like Refi DAO Barcelona or hachathon participation.\nReal-World Impact Initiatives: Leverage CeloPolis as a platform to educate and engage users in real-world social impact projects built on the Celo blockchain.\nContinuous Community Building: Actively participate in the Celo community, contribute to discussions, and support other projects within the ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, my past experiences and our future plans demonstrate a strong commitment to the Celo ecosystem.

Our primary focus is on creating a local circular economy that emphasizes gifting, donations, and tipping, with a particular emphasis on supporting panhandlers and vulnerable populations. By leveraging blockchain technology and digital platforms, GreenPill TO strives to make financial transactions more accessible and impactful for everyone in the community - regardless of their prior knowledge of crypto and with no need to learn anything about blockchain unless they want to.\n\nMission\n\nOur mission at GreenPill TO is to build a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable local economy in Toronto. We aim to harness the power of technology to create financial tools that empower individuals, support local businesses, and foster a culture of giving and community support. Through our initiatives, we strive to turn the tide on economic disparity and ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age. GreenPill TO also endeavors to reclaim the positive potential of cryptocurrency, providing a safe haven for ethical innovators to connect, collaborate, and create solutions that benefit society as a whole.\n\nProblem\n\nPanhandlers, low wage workers and other vulnerable groups in Toronto are increasingly struggling as society moves away from physical currency. The decline in cash transactions means fewer people have coins or small bills readily available to give to those in need. This shift has created a significant gap in support for individuals who rely on these small but crucial donations for their day-to-day survival. We think that building a local and circular community currency with built-in charitable component can be a part in solving this problem.\n\nIn addition, the broader world of cryptocurrency faces significant challenges. Many people associate crypto with scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes, which has tarnished its reputation. Despite this, there remains a substantial community of individuals who see the potential of blockchain technology to drive positive social change. However, these well-meaning individuals often lack a safe, trustworthy space to collaborate and develop their ideas. GreenPill TO seeks to fill this void by providing a reliable community and platform where ethical and impactful projects can thrive.\n\nSolution\n\nGreenPill TO addresses these problems by providing a community for value-aligned people. We help by ideating, architecting and project-managing hackathon projects and BUIDLs - developing a suite of digital tools designed to facilitate easy and secure transactions. We currently have three daily check-in sessions, one for each of the three concurrent flagship projects:\n\n1. Tipping & Panhandler App that enables digital tipping and donations\n2. The Toronto Coin, a local cryptocurrency that encourages spending within the community.\n3. ChainCrew, a platform for \"web2 DAOs\", allowing anyone to create and set up their own \"Crew\" which can handle real money with\n\nThese tools ensure that people can still support panhandlers and local businesses, even without carrying physical cash.

We are a local Chapter within the broader **GreenPill Network**, with a mission of turning Degens into Regens.\n\nWe started this community with an aim at fostering a resilient and inclusive local economy through innovative technology and community engagement. Our primary focus is on running a **weekly meetup** for all web3 builders  in Toronto, where we coordinate, help each other and generally chat about how we can make the world a better place. We call it **\"web3 for good\"**, to distinguish it from the crypto-bros who are more interested in price action and shilling. These meetups have been running weekly **since Aug 2024**.\n\n**We also build.** Our projects focus around creating a **local circular economy** that emphasizes gifting, donations, and tipping, with a particular emphasis on supporting panhandlers and vulnerable populations. By leveraging blockchain technology and digital platforms, GreenPill TO strives to make financial transactions more accessible and impactful for everyone in the community - regardless of their prior knowledge of crypto and with no need to learn anything about blockchain unless they want to.\n\n\n## Mission\n\nOur mission at GreenPill TO is to **build a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable local economy in Toronto**. We aim to harness the power of web3 technology to create **post-capitalist financial tools** that empower individuals, support local businesses, and foster a culture of giving and community support. Through our initiatives, we strive to turn the tide on economic disparity and ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age. \n\nGreenPill TO endeavors to reclaim the positive potential of cryptocurrency, providing a safe haven for ethical innovators to connect, collaborate, and create solutions that benefit society as a whole.\n\n\n## Problem\n\nThe broader world of cryptocurrency faces significant challenges. Many people associate crypto with scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes, which has tarnished its reputation. Crypto is seen as out of reach from those who could benefit from it the most, when so many projects assume that you start with money to \"invest\" in their ponzis and rugpulls. \n\nDespite this, a substantial community of individuals remain who see the potential of blockchain technology to drive positive social change. However, these well-meaning individuals often lack a safe, trustworthy space to collaborate and develop their ideas. GreenPill TO seeks to fill this void by providing a reliable community and platform where ethical and impactful projects can thrive.\n\n## Solution\n\nGreenPill TO addresses these problems by providing a **community for value-aligned hackers, dreamers and doers**. We help each other by coming together frequently and coordinating. We ideate, architect problem solve together. We manage, participate in and sponsor hackathon projects and BUIDLs. We develop a suite of digital tools designed to facilitate easy and secure transactions. Join us on Luma: https://lu.ma/GreenPillTO\n\n\n## Projects\n\nWe are involved in running four concurrent flagship projects:\n\n1. **CUBID Protocol**, a proof-of-personhood and bot-proofing protocols with easy APIs for develpers to leverage. https://www.cubid.me/\n2. **The Toronto Coin**, a local cryptocurrency that encourages spending within the community. https://www.tcoin.me/\n3. **ChainCrew**, a platform for \"web2 DAOs\", allowing anyone to create and set up their own \"Crew\" within which anyone can handle real money in a DAO-like setting with community and governance features. https://chaincrew.xyz/\n4. **Tipping & Panhandler App** that enables digital tipping and donations. https://www.sparechange.tips/\n\nThese tools ensure that people of Toronto (and the world) can self-organize and self-govern. They help Torontonians support panhandlers and local businesses, even without carrying physical cash. \n\n\n## Other\n\nGreenPillTO has developed partnerships with prominent Toronto institutions such as **Toronto DAO** (https://www.tdao.to/) and the **Procent Foundation** (https://www.procent.foundation/)\n\nAdditionally, our participation in hackathons like ETH Toronto and BlockHack help us

We are developing and adapting a template for the regenerative community marketplace.\n\nSo far, we have onboarded several stakeholders, such as greenhouses, farmers, artists, and more, and we are mapping a network state of impact in Mexico. This will eventually become a full-fledged marketplace (e-commerce) for regenerative products and services. We are building and experimenting with concepts, actions, connecting channels, and regenerative literature to create a comprehensive platform for the community.\n\n**Utilizing the Celo Ecosystem:**\n\n- **NFT Minter and Marketplace:** Our evolving NFT minter and marketplace will be built on the Celo platform, leveraging its blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and scalability.\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00001.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nrCbkcHk/Re-Fi-minter-00001.png)](https://postimg.cc/Fk5BFvkd)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00002.png](https://i.postimg.cc/50PWLFMy/Re-Fi-minter-00002.png)](https://postimg.cc/xJbZS88V)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00003.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HWhCL52P/Re-Fi-minter-00003.png)](https://postimg.cc/gr87Sx1v)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00004.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gjQ9BFjP/Re-Fi-minter-00004.png)](https://postimg.cc/Lgt0nWjy)\n\n- **Tokenomics and Framework Design:** By contributing to the state of the art in tokenomics and framework design, we aim to set new standards for regenerative finance within the Celo ecosystem.\n  - Read more here (don't forget to mint): [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/refimexico.eth)\n  - Check out our [White Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTUaVFSvcLJ_LIiKt6X9Z7BQ7SIKJbzDLdpSoh6vdtc/edit)\n  - Explore our [Github](https://github.com/ReFiMexico/NFT-Minter)\n  - Karma: [Gap Karma](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-mexico---building-a-regenerative-community-nft-impact-minter)\n  - Don't forget to visit our [Web page](https://refimexico.org/en)\n\n- **Stakeholder Onboarding:** We have successfully onboarded various stakeholders, including greenhouses, farmers, and artists, to our community, and they are ready to dive into the Celo ecosystem, facilitating their transition to blockchain-based solutions.

Our educational efforts aim to make web3 technologies accessible to broader audiences, while showcasing their ability to provide solutions for real-world problems. \n\nOne of our projects is the book On-Chain Impact Networks that illustrates how diverse communities are utilizing crypto and blockchain to drive tangible impact, by providing a 100-page deep dive into over 80 on-chain projects, protocols, networks, and DAOs. To increase the scale of the book’s relevance for different audiences, it covers many areas including Decentralized Science, Community Funding Protocols, ReFi, Climate and Environmental Regeneration, Culture, Education, Infrastructure, and Impact Measurement. The digital version is accessible to everyone. \n[![Screenshot-2024-10-29-171924.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HnpLXH3f/Screenshot-2024-10-29-171924.png)](https://postimg.cc/2bKmNssw)  [On-Chain Impact Networks](https://greenpill.network/pdf/onchain-impact-networks.pdf) \nAnother notable resource the Writers Guild has contributed to is the Capital Allocation Book Explorers Edition, which offers practical insights into effective resource allocation, which has its planned release in DevCon this year. \n\n—--------------------------\n\nThe future looks bright for our upcoming efforts. Two focuses in the coming months will be: \n\nThe launch of  a new Greenpill On-boarding program, providing valuable resources to promote the use of crypto and blockchain in regenerative practices.\nThe launch of a newsletter to highlight our regional chapters, guilds, and projects that are advocating for and implementing blockchain in their initiatives.\nWe are excited about the journey ahead and look forward to empowering communities through education and collaboration.\n\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"Greenpill Writers

is a public sphere where a collective of Commons Builders explores Crypto Thoughts together. It was formerly known as GreenPill Chinese Community.\n\n\nThe Web3.0 landscape is rife with decentralized politico-economic movements, exploring grand visions like public goods, sovereign individuals, UBI, network states, creator economies, Ostrom’s school of public choice, radical markets, Harberger taxes, and more. At Uncommons, we aspire to foster a community of internet citizens who are intrigued by radical 'crypto thoughts.' Our goal is to explore the feasibility of public goods, the journey to becoming a sovereign individual, discussing radical markets through the lens of Austrian School monetary theory, and the potential integration of Harberger taxes into Web3. We aim to explore whether DAOs can strike a balance between Leviathan and privatization in addressing the tragedy of the commons, akin to Ostrom's concept of self-governance.\n\n\nUncommons Research Scope\nhttps://www.uncommons.cc/_next/static/media/researchScopes.edfe5477.svg\n\nUncommons TG group\nhttps://t.me/theuncommons\n\nUncommons Notion\nhttps://www.notion.so/uncommons/Uncommons-04ea0224d3cd4fe9b5181b6dd22d02b4\n\nUncommons Publishing\nhttps://matters.town/@creatorgreen","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"Un__commons"},"recipient":"0xAC62a8ce834Cc2e426Ed286FFD7C853869737820"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreigh6ean64rlobhbt2mwuzkixkstufuzgit6fity2qgyimxwn62iau","projects":[{"name":"Uncommons","id":"0xd74a730d2baf2d4647db796cdb5fb7ea3a7886520bd20a4a3430bb1961d5cbd5","metadata":{"title":"Uncommons","logoImg":"bafkreib7namnv7atmic5gmtu43vnrmew4oiyfq6qqjyrkx4ohjp2ntbeam","website":"https://www.uncommons.cc/","bannerImg":"bafkreidik5jznmgkpt4nmkqgrt74paoxzaphbko2zkbufioknlqdpzn7ne","createdAt":1723395695552,"credentials":{},"description":"Uncommons is a digital commons fostering a collective of Commons Builders, evolving from the GreenPill Chinese community.\n\nIt's a space where crypto enthusiasts, social builders, dreamers, and netizens collide with crypto-humanitarian ideas. Uncommons explores new governance methods for public goods, practices Green Pill's renewable economics, and has grown into a unique ecosystem of quality content creation and research.\n\nIt represents a new beginning, deepening our engagement with digital public resources and unconventional, innovative thinking. Our community, rooted in Habermas's concept of the \"public sphere,\" aims to create a noise-resistant, ideologically united community. We emphasize individual sovereignty, rethinking network power structures for fairness, transparency, and decentralization.\n\nThe name Uncommons symbolizes our ongoing focus on digital commons, managed and maintained by communities rather than private or governmental entities. It embodies the spirit of exploring, reimagining, and challenging mainstream norms, infusing our mission to build public domains with uniqueness and creativity.\n\nUncommons' Notion homepage, serving as a record of current work and a platform for expression, can be found at: Uncommons Notion Page. Our daily discussions mainly take place on our Telegram channel: Uncommons Telegram.\n\nUncommons has established 6 workstream groups, which are:\n\nGreenPill Podcast Co-learning: Engaging with frontline individuals on the GreenPill concept, focusing on the development of ImpactDAO. Since October 2022, the GP podcast co-learning group has been recruiting long-term members who extract essence and co-learn from this podcast, enhancing attention and understanding of the international community. It has been running for nearly 10 months, becoming one of the community's long-term content outputs and providing a good workflow template for other workstreams.\n\nhttps://uncommons.xlog.app/GreenPill_Podcasts\n\nWe also do the Greenpill book translation in Chinese:\n\nGreenpilled (CN)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1e0vACcdEzHLoVAKUdHdH0S7qEpOuc2hm/view\n\nImpactDAOs (CN)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1eL-M4FfxQO61Sg4sUQK1x559FPGJa1EI/view\n\nUncommons x Protector: Governance through participation: In collaboration with Protector, Uncommons members are actively participating in the governance of DAOs like Nouns, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more.\n\nDeSci workshop (Decentralized Science): The Uncommons community has launched a six-talk series on DeSci, participated in DeSci-themed donations, formed groups for co-learning, and participated in the governance of Gitcoin DeSci.\n\nWamo Summer One-Year Retrospective: Taking community participation in creating Wamo Summer as a case study, reflecting on it from the perspective of the Uncommons community on its first anniversary.\n\nETS - Ethereum Translation Squad: Translating Ethereum content with other Chinese communities, exploring new forms of social structures using the decentralized societal ideology represented by Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Nomad: Exploring the novel political identity constructed by the 'crypto nomads' and the social structures emerging around this identity.\n\nAs a content and research-oriented community, we have also produced research content: Uncommons Research and translated Vitalik's blog into Chinese: Vitalik's Blog in Chinese. Additionally, Uncommons actively spreads its message on various social platforms to attract more Chinese-speaking builders:\n\nUncommons is deeply committed to enhancing the Web3 ecosystem. Our focus is on creating a robust community for Commons Builders, where we explore and implement innovative ideas in crypto-humanitarianism. Through initiatives like GreenPill Podcast Co-learning, DeSci workshops, and collaboration with projects like Protector, we're actively engaged in developing decentralized governance structures, contributing to the broader discourse, and nurturing a diverse, inclusive, and dynamic Web3 community.\n\nThe impact of Uncommons is measured through various metrics and examples, including:\n\nEngagement Metrics: Tracking participation in our workstreams like the GreenPill Podcast Co-learning and DeSci workshops, monitoring the number of active members, and engagement levels on our Telegram channel.\n\nContent Reach: Analyzing the distribution and reach of our research outputs, Vitalik's blog translations, and content shared on platforms like Matters and Medium.\n\nGovernance Participation: Evaluating our influence in DAO governance through the Uncommons x Protector collaboration, by assessing the level of active involvement and decision-making impact.\n\nCommunity Growth: Monitoring the growth rate of our community, including new member sign-ups and retention rates.\n\nFeedback and Testimonials: Collecting qualitative feedback from community members and collaborators to assess the perceived value and impact of our initiatives.\n\n\n\nUncommons Research Scope\nhttps://www.uncommons.cc/_next/static/media/researchScopes.edfe5477.svg\n\nUncommons TG group\nhttps://t.me/theuncommons\n\nUncommons Notion\nhttps://www.notion.so/uncommons/Uncommons-04ea0224d3cd4fe9b5181b6dd22d02b4\n\nUncommons Publishing\nhttps://matters.town/@creatorgreen","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"Un__commons"},"metadataCid":"bafkreifvlj4jn7mqnb6gjxvnmxpnwckps7mm3vv7jqbb5dt2qnph7orjam","timestamp":"2024-08-11T17:03:51+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x18Fb694EbAE03a78f038F54362592Dd89c0e300C","createdAtBlock":241813571},{"name":"Uncommons","id":"0xd74a730d2baf2d4647db796cdb5fb7ea3a7886520bd20a4a3430bb1961d5cbd5","metadata":{"type":"project","canonical":{"chainId":42161,"registryAddress":"0x4aacca72145e1df2aec137e1f3c5e3d75db8b5f3"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreidz522abd5yfyfqzt6eb6t5p3ajqbxtkktpylhmsvy7nuuupzjdrm","timestamp":"2024-08-11T17:47:29+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"linked","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x18Fb694EbAE03a78f038F54362592Dd89c0e300C","createdAtBlock":27145273}],"projectId":"0xd74a730d2baf2d4647db796cdb5fb7ea3a7886520bd20a4a3430bb1961d5cbd5","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"14","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2024-08-11T17:47:54.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27145278"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2024-08-12T06:52:33.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"27154693"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":27208335,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2024-08-11T17:47:54+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":56.72687,"totalDonationsCount":22,"uniqueDonorsCount":20}]}}
