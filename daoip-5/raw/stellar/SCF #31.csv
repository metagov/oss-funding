The platform is currently being deployed in our beachhead market, with a few merchants and we have a backlog of 500 additional merchants with signed LOIs through large networks of merchants and associations.
    
-   Our double-sided platform serves both large institutions and consumers who send billions annually to beneficiaries in Central America and the Caribbean. Kura is the smartest alternative to traditional P2P cash remittances and international cash disbursement.
    

Service #1: B2B2C - Cross-border solution for merchants to enable them to accept cross-border payments with USDC at their points of sale. Kura uses Stellar Wallets to facilitate transfer of value between sponsors (US-based) and merchants (emerging markets).

Service #2: Disbursement Aid Solutions for NGOS/Large Donor organizations in the Caribbean/Central America regions using Stellar's SDP.

Service #3: Connect to online merchants via API enabling merchants to accept online payments via the Kura Platform at Checkout. (Future development)

  
Future Development*

-   Kura Merchants (counterparties) are able to trade crypto to access local currency (gourdes) at any Moneygram location with the MoneyGram Access API. We have already kickstarted the process with Miguel Garza on this.
    
-   Kura merchants (counterparties) are able to get paid in the local currency in a bank account (We are working with a local bank at the moment to enable this)
    
-   Kura Merchants can accept crypto payments from verified and KYC'ed Stellar wallet in all the markets that Kura operates in, starting with Haiti. This will expand the amount of USDC in circulation in our beachhead market and reduce cash use.  
    Rinse, repeat, scale in other neighboring countries in the Caribbean regions where traditional banking system have failed the majority of the population.

Identity Operating System (idOS),SCF #31,Implementing a self-custodial and compliant identity layer on Stellar,Identity Operating System (idOS),Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recFctBzb2Zo3VO4z,Awarded,33.0,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$125000.00,$41666.67,100272.49,,Build,Implement the idOS on Stellar to unlock KYC-reusability even for obligated entities and user-owned data management,"The idOS is a decentralized identity and storage layer. It gives users the ability to be in control of their own data and dApps to make even KYC onboarding as smooth as signing a transaction.  
  
The idOS is a network of nodes that stores user-encrypted data and uses a proof-of-state consensus to enforce user request. Unlike P2P decentralized storage providers, it allows for data privacy ( e.g. GDPR) compliance.  
  
In a world that finally sees self-custodial rails being used in the real world, especially for finance application, the idOS bridges identity user information over from one dApp and use case to another.  
  
Imagine investing on a RWA platform and later wanting to offer this stake on an institutional DEX pool. Usually both cases would require a full KYC process. The idOS allows both entities to exchange this information with the consent of the user. Imagine, having a wallet that acts both as a bank account as well as a hub for various financial dApps: These use cases need an identity orchestration layer that the idOS provides.  
  
The integration can be separated in three steps that finish with an implementation of the idOS into Stellar:

1.  General implementation and system operability, specifically PPKP interoperability and message-signing recognition
    
1.  SEP-10 support and native wallet support
    
1.  SEP-12 integration to allow wallet --> Anchor or wallet --> dApp flows
    

  
The integration would allow a native and user-self-custodial passing of KYC information. It would e.g. allow Vibrant to connect to the idOS to securely store KYC information and enable user data management as well as KYC passing. It does not enable an attestation system for smart contract native identity gating use cases.",https://docs.idos.network/idos-docs/how-it-works/system-architecture,"1.  Technical implementation and readiness (the product is implemented and can be used)
    
1.  Number of data consumers (we have at least 3 dApps that actively use the idOS)
    
1.  Number of users (undefined)",https://idos.network,https://github.com/idos-network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ZtdDg0N7n4Q,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","We are identifying use collaboration use cases that require an orchestration layer for decentralized identity: That could e.g. be a Vibrant integration to unlock the use case in general, but would ideally be in combination with other obligated entities that are used in the same frontend.  
  
This could be  

1.  Consumer focused applications like e.g. Vibrant implementing self-custodial debit card providers like Kulipa, crypto-to-fiat remittance companies and bank account features like e.g. Monerium offers in one dApp.
    
1.  RWA value chain cases like the Tokenization provider that is auctioning off an asset passing on the KYC information to a permissioned DEX that allows institutional investors to provide liquidity and a lending marketplace using the asset as collateral for a crypto-to-fiat payout. These providers could implement the idOS to avoid having to each KYC the user.
    
1.  Compliant financial transaction privacy: Having a clean pool of KYCed users allows data privacy in a compliant way as transactions can be obfuscated without violating AML laws.
    

We place special attention to making sure that we only deploy in ecosystems where we see a good path towards adoption. The idOS only works when people and dApps sign up for it which is why it is important to us to ensure adoption and usage.","The idOS is the first identity protocol to gather significant support for creating a joint standard to store, manage and exchange user data: The idOS is a consortium that Arbitrum Foundation, Circle (through its affiliate Circle Ventures), Ripple, NEAR Foundation, Gnosis, Aleph Zero Foundation, Radix and the Tezos Foundation (Etherlink) joined.  
The idOS is specifically relevant for real world financial use cases as it unlocks KYC-reusability and self-custodial data management that is data privacy compliant. The idOS is currently live on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum having processed over 2.500 users. We are currently working on bringing the idOS live with obligated entities providing services via our consortium partners and potentially Stellar.","Tranche 1: basic Stellar support

1.  Referral program
    

After successfully completing an advertising campaign, an influencer typically brings in 2-3 other influencers.

1.  Telegram mini-app for user incentivization with future implementation of Passkey auth https://t.me/B4BinfluenceBot/InfluenceScore?startapp=ref_djx8KO Users can measure their influence score and increase it by inviting influencers to the platform.

Soroban Resource Usage Reporter is designed to meet the specific needs of developers working within the Soroban ecosystem. In the coding and testing phases, this tool enables developers to efficiently track resource usage through key metrics, much like Hardhat Gas Reporter helps Ethereum developers streamline contract efficiency. By offering insights into these metrics, developers are empowered to write more efficient and cost-effective smart contracts from the very start.

For Stellar, this tool can help drive adoption and best practices within the ecosystem. By providing developers with early-stage resource usage tracking and optimization suggestions, Stellar can foster a community that is conscious of resource efficiency, which is crucial for maintaining scalability and cost-effectiveness across the network.

Additionally, as developers refine their contracts with the help of our Resource Usage Reporter, this can lead to better overall performance and lower transaction costs on the Stellar chain, contributing to Stellar’s long-term success.

Goal

We propose to develop a Node.js-based Resource Usage Reporter tool specifically for Stellar, designed to offer developers detailed insights into resource consumption metrics during their coding and testing cycles. The primary aim is to enable developers to track key data points, such as execution frequency and resource fee, and receive basic suggestions for improving efficiency.

Looking ahead, while our current focus is on optimizing development workflows through essential resource tracking, we aim to expand the tool’s functionality to further support the Soroban ecosystem as it grows. This will reinforce Stellar’s commitment to developer support and network sustainability, with an emphasis on enhancing workflows and contributing to the chain’s long term performance and scalability.

Considering resource limitations, the resource usage reporter will assist developers in optimizing their smart contract code by highlighting cost variations in contract function calls under constrained resources, as well as displaying function call runtimes. The insights provided in the generated table will guide developers in reducing resource consumption, managing fee limitations, and improving the speed of contract function execution.

Swift Wallet SDK,SCF #31,Implement the Swift Wallet SDK,Swift Wallet SDK,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec5wu2mm18ZnTHqP,Awarded,100.0,Pre-Launch #3 - Mainnet,$76800.00,$76800.00,211480.15,5/1/2025,Build,"Implementation of the Swift Wallet SDK to offer native iOS developers the same functionality that is available in the TypeScript, Kotlin and Flutter Wallet SDKs.","Interoperability between payment applications such as wallets and on/off ramps such as Stellar anchors has always been one of the most important pillars for Stellar. That's why the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) started defining standards for wallets and anchors very early on to facilitate their interoperability and to maximize the adoption.

The basic consideration here is that, from the wallet developer's point of view, it should make no difference whether they integrate with one anchor or with several different ones. The power of this interoperability standard is that you code once and ideally with very little modifications you can support multiple companies and you can provide a very competitive service in terms of your wallet offering.

However, because these standards were defined very early on to maximize adoption, with very little information about the most important user cases, the consequence was that they had to be extended again and again over the last 10 years to reflect the wallet and anchor builder’s needs. But evolving the standard is not an easy thing, you don’t want to break anyone who is already compatible, so you need to create this backwards compatible evolution system that ends up becoming almost like a patchwork where you either grow by having a fixed set of endpoints with a lot of optional parameters or you have a bunch of endpoints that do slightly different things. It is probably impossible to get as close to a good API as if you had defined that from the go considering all the use cases and accommodated all of them. As a result, these standards have become very complex, extensive, and interconnected over time. See for example SEP-06 or SEP-24.

The standard API for interoperability between wallets and anchors was defined by SDF via so-called Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs). And the original recommendation for developers to become interoperable was to read the SEPs and implement them. However, since these are very complex, extensive and cover many edge cases, this led to many different interpretations during implementation.

That's why SDF came up with the idea of implementing so-called Wallet SDKs about two years ago. These are software libraries that implement the needed functionality and that developers can integrate into their program, so as not to keep reinventing the wheel over and over again.

The integration of a wallet SDK makes it very easy for the developer of a client application to become interoperable. They do not have to develop the communication with the anchor themselves, but only use the SDK. Furthermore, this helps to remain interoperable, because every time the standard evolves, a new version of the SDK is also released, and the developer only must update to use the new version of the library. It is a common, natural process for software developers. And, because the functionality is already implemented, developers can become interoperable much faster and at a much lower cost than if they were to implement the functionality from scratch themselves. This means that developers have more time to focus on implementing their business logic instead of constantly reinventing the wheel by having to implement Stellar details.

Wallet SDKs are currently offered for three different programming languages. The Stellar Development Foundation created and maintained the TypeScript and the Kotlin Wallet SDKs. And the Flutter (dart) Wallet SDK was developed and is maintained by me (Soneso). You can find their documentation on the official Stellar docs website under: Build a Wallet with the Wallet SDK.

All three SDKs offer the same functionality and the same interfaces for integration. These were defined by SDF when the TypeScript and Kotlin SDKs were implemented.

The new Swift Wallet SDK will implement all the current features of the other SDKs from the Wallet SDK family (Stellar Integration, SEP-01, SEP-10, SEP-09, SEP-12, SEP-24, SEP-06, SEP-38, SEP-30, SEP-07). As soon as new features are defined and implemented by SDF, the Swift Wallet SDK will grow with them. Like the other Wallet SDKs, the Swift Wallet SDK will be build upon the corresponding Horizon SDK, the Horizon iOS Stellar SDK, of which I am the main developer and maintainer.

If you are interested in learning more about the importance and usability of the Wallet SDKs, please check out this Meridian presentation by Alex Cordeiro (Senior Director, Engineering, SDF).",https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/architecture.pdf,The SDK makes it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products.,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk,https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-swift-wallet-sdk,https://youtu.be/YjmWVLasTYk,"Maybe in the future, but not in this submission","The SDK will be listed on the official Stellar Wallet SDK Page and on the Stellar Wallet SDK docs page. Furthermore, a new section will be created for the SDK in the official Stellar Discord Channel sdk-hub, where I will be available to developers for their questions and help them with the integration.","Because the Swift Wallet SDK is a new project, I can only provide evidence of prior traction or validation via the Horizon iOS Stellar SDK, on which the Swift Wallet SDK will be build upon. The open-source Horizon iOS Stellar SDK is used by many projects including the Lobstr Wallet and has more than 100 stars on GitHub. It has also won the Stellar Build Challenge #6.

This enables sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers while creating a new asset class. SiBorg will integrate its existing system with Stellar's Soroban to leverage scalable architecture and efficient on/off-ramping solutions.","What SiBorg Is 
SiBorg is building a decentralized monetization protocol, transforming the visibility of media and creators into a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across multiple interfaces. This allows buyers to speculate on the future growth of publishers.

The Problem
There are no Web3-native sponsorship solutions. Apps and publishers have to rely on off-chain (and often opaque) methods to generate revenue from sponsors. While we are seeing more decentralized tools for the creator economy (e.g., Lens, Paragraph), current approaches to generating revenue still rely on traditional business models (gifts, subsriptions, advertising), which don’t leverage tokenization opportunities. As a result, one cannot invest in the growth of a media outlet, creator, or app's visibility, they can only spend advertising budgets, stuck in a KPI-centric model.
The Solution
We are creating an on-chain sponsorship protocol that introduces a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across websites, newsletters, and Telegram channels. This asset class transforms visibility into a tradable financial instrument, allowing sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers, such as media outlets. Our solution builds trust and strengthens reputations by aligning the interests of sponsors, now seen as investors, with those of publishers. Publishers retain full control over the content displayed, preventing scammy ads from appearing. This also creates an additional revenue stream for publishers, who receive upfront payments and earn royalties from secondary market transactions. Publishers can join our marketplace to create tokenized offers for their ad spaces. Sponsors can then purchase these spaces and submit advertising proposals for publisher approval. Sponsors also benefit from a secondary market, where they can resell ad spaces or, in the future, even use them as collateral for loans.

How It Works and Its Use of Soroban
We’ve already launched a first version on Base (EVM). Now, we’re planning to deploy on the Stellar network using Soroban to take advantage of the scalable architecture and seamless global on and off-ramping capabilities.
- “DSponsor” Smart Contracts (permissionless)
    - These contracts handle the tokenization of ad spaces, turning visibility (like digital website parcels) into assets that can be traded.
    - They also include DeFi and marketplace logic, as well as handlers for ad submission (on the sponsor side) and validation (on the publisher side). Important to note: The contracts store only data hashes, while actual files (such as logos) are stored on decentralized storage platforms like IPFS.
- “App” Frontend 
    - The frontend allows both sponsors and publishers to interact with smart contracts, enabling features like login functionality, handling payments for tokenized ad spaces, and administration tools for managing ad campaigns.
    - With a focus on user experience, the app is designed to operate without requiring any Web3 knowledge, ensuring ease of use with minimal transaction fees, near-instant settlements, and smooth on-ramping.
-  “Relayer” API & SDK
- GraphQL and REST APIs, along with SDKs in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust, serve information from smart contract events to the frontend.
- This system allows any publisher (creators, dApps, media outlets) to automatically integrate validated ads into their platforms, including websites, newsletters, Telegram channels, with more platforms to come.

Cede Labs,SCF #31,Cede Labs: Unlocking liquidity between CeFi and DeFi effortlessly,Cede Labs,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recP8ThGTCNqAQIj6,Awarded,33.0,Pre-Launch #1 - MVP,$119800.00,$79866.66,247446.34,5/30/2025,Build,"Cede Labs specializes in bridging the gap between Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by offering seamless, secure connectivity to over 15 Centralized Exchange (CEX) APIs. Our innovative solutions unlock liquidity from CEXs, enabling effortless integration for dApps and asset managers to optimize their operations without compromising user experience.","The Problem:
CEX connectivity presents significant challenges due to the tremendous lack of fluidity between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This disconnection prevents the seamless transfer of liquidity, with over 40% of crypto liquidity trapped in centralized exchanges, limiting the potential for DeFi innovation and broader ecosystems like Stellar. Moreover, existing liquidity gateway solutions are inefficient, expensive, or not user-friendly (FIAT on-ramp, Bridges, …); with CEX integration being highly complex, especially for Web3 teams whose core expertise lies elsewhere. Adding to the difficulty, the maintenance of CEX API keys requires heavy ressources and continuous monitoring. 

The Solution:
To bridge the gap between CeFi & DeFi, Cede Labs is building two products: 

- Cede.store:
To answer to a demand of DeFi & blockchain builders to bring more liquidity into their products (dApps, wallets, …) in a simple way without spending money or development time, Cede Labs built cede.store. 
Cede.store is a non-custodial browser extension to store CEX (centralized exchanges) API keys and to sign CEX requests from the client-side. Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets with a familiar UX and DX as DeFi wallets (e.g. Metamask).
Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets. In that way, we offer the dApp a way to track and manage a user's CEX assets while staying non-custodial and keeping the same UX as any DeFi browser wallet.

To integrate cede.store into a dApp, similar to how a DeFi wallet functions, the dApp interacts with a provider object (e.g., `window.ethereum` for EVM wallets or `window.cede` for cede.store). The dApp can execute various methods, such as retrieving balances or initiating a withdrawal from the exchange to the blockchain.

If a project prefers not to interact directly with this API, they can utilize our widget, which facilitates the transfer of funds from a CEX to the user’s address. For a list of all our partners, visit https://cede.store/partners.


- Cede SDK:
For more advanced integrations and white-label needs, builders can opt to use our Cede SDK. This solution offers deeper customization of CEX connectivity, allowing developers to store CEX API keys wherever they see fit, ensure mobile compatibility, and bypass the need for the cede.store browser extension.
Currently, Cede SDK is a CEX connectivity SDK helping custody providers and custodians fast-forward their CEX integrations for asset management. 
Basically: Fireblocks’ CEX connectivity as a service.

Stellar Integration & Soroban: As part of our broader strategy, Cede Labs is working to integrate the Stellar blockchain into its API and SDK. This will allow Stellar-based dApps to access liquidity from centralized exchanges, greatly expanding Stellar’s utility. Soroban, Stellar’s smart contract engine, will be instrumental in this integration, particularly through the introduction of an ""Instant Protocol Deposit"" feature. This feature will enable users to seamlessly transfer assets from CEXs directly into Stellar-based protocols, such as DeFi applications, without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging Soroban, we ensure that this functionality is permissionless and optimized for security and scalability, helping Stellar attract significant liquidity and making it a competitive player in the DeFi space.

Why We Chose Stellar
We selected Stellar’s blockchain infrastructure for three primary reasons:
1. Alignment with Our Vision for Institutional-Grade Liquidity Solutions: Stellar provides the scalability, low transaction fees, and cross-border functionality essential for institutions managing large volumes of digital assets. With Stellar’s infrastructure, we can offer our clients seamless connectivity to manage CEX liquidity more efficiently, allowing them to bridge the gap between centralized exchanges and decentralized applications.
2. Focus on Cross-Border Payments and Financial Inclusion: Stellar’s well-established reputation as a leader in cross-border payments perfectly aligns with our goal to facilitate liquidity management across global markets. For institutional players looking to streamline CEX operations and manage assets across borders, Cede.store and Cede SDK offer the ideal tools to integrate into the Stellar ecosystem.
3. Strong connections with the institutional space and with Ripple: the current niche where Cede Labs is focusing at the moment with Cede SDK product is the custody solutions space. Knowing that Stellar is very close to Ripple, one of the leaders in the institutional custody space with its product Ripple Custody, is a strong argument that led us to choose Stellar. 

This not only empowers financial institutions but also accelerates the integration of Stellar’s ecosystem into mainstream financial operations. As we continue to refine our offerings, Cede Labs is committed to driving the adoption of Stellar by providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for institutional participation in the blockchain ecosystem.

These developments will complete the EquitX protocol, providing users with a fully functional, scalable, and secure platform for trading xAssets, earning rewards, and participating in decentralized governance.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOZHyFoe9iy4MnBr7lNZh-eLi54gLrKEoFymBX5xNyE/edit?tab=t.0,"Success for EquitX is about democratizing access to investments in nano-cap, micro-cap, and small-cap companies, offering opportunities that have traditionally been difficult for retail investors to tap into. The platform’s success will be measured by both quantitative and qualitative outcomes:

1. New users and investor base expansion: we aim to attract a diverse user base, starting with blockchain-savvy investors and expanding to include non-crypto-native investors.

-   Output: Reaching 20,000 active users within the first 12 months of full platform launch, with a balanced mix of both crypto and non-crypto investors.
    
-   Impact: Expanding financial access to traditionally hard-to-reach investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to diversify their portfolios into smaller, high-growth companies. This broadens financial inclusion by offering exposure to markets typically reserved for institutional investors.
    

1. Enhanced liquidity for nano, micro, and small-cap companies: by offering these companies a platform where their stocks are represented as synthetic assets (xAssets), EquitX increases their market visibility and provides an alternative source of liquidity.

-   Output: Onboarding 5+ nano, micro, and small-cap companies as xAssets within the first year. We won’t be integrating more than 5 company xAssets within this first year to keep good liquidity for each asset. 
    
-   Impact: Helping smaller companies grow by increasing their visibility and liquidity without requiring them to go through conventional fundraising channels, such as equity dilution. This can drive economic growth, particularly in niche markets and emerging sectors.
    

1. Increased Trading Volume and Liquidity in the DeFi Space: EquitX expects substantial trading volume within the platform itself, where users can trade synthetic assets backed by small-cap companies. Additionally, EquitX will leverage Stellar’s DEXs to facilitate external trading of xAssets, further enhancing liquidity for both investors and small-cap stocks.

-   Output: Reaching $60 million XLM in total trading volume, both within the EquitX platform and through external trading on Stellar DEXs, within the first year.
    
-   Impact: Bringing new liquidity into the Stellar ecosystem by encouraging the trading of synthetic assets. This will drive platform engagement, while also fostering financial innovation by bridging traditional financial markets and decentralized finance (DeFi).
    

1. Total Value Locked (TVL): EquitX expects to accumulate significant value locked within its platform, providing liquidity for synthetic assets and enhancing trading opportunities.

-   Output: Reaching $15 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the first year.
    
-   Impact: A strong TVL will ensure liquidity and stability across the platform, encouraging more active participation from investors and supporting efficient trading of xAssets. This will also build confidence in the platform’s sustainability and growth potential.
    

1. Number of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs): EquitX aims to drive high user engagement through the opening of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), allowing users to collateralize assets and mint xAssets.

-   Output: Establishing 1,500 CDPs within the first year.
    
-   Impact: The growth in the number of CDPs will demonstrate active user participation and platform trust. This will enhance liquidity within the system and create a more robust market for xAssets, reinforcing the platform’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance.
    

1. Security and transparency: Stellar’s blockchain, combined with Soroban smart contracts, will provide secure, transparent, and efficient transactions for users.

-   Output: Maintaining 100% transparency and security for all platform transactions, with no security breaches or fraud.
    
-   Impact: Enhancing user trust and confidence in the platform, which is crucial for widespread adoption and long-term growth.
    

In summary, success for EquitX will be measured by the growth of its user base, the liquidity it brings to nano, micro, and small-cap companies, the trading volume it facilitates, and the financial opportunities it opens up for a broader audience. The impact goes beyond numbers, EquitX will create a new bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, offering a solution for investors to access untapped market potential in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner.

These numbers are mainly based on a similar protocol, Indigo, that has been launched 2 years ago on Cardano.",https://equitx.com/,https://github.com/EquitXCompany/equitx-project,https://youtu.be/A6r_Rzc2N2A?si=IdNPNvJEmbxhLTO2,Yes,"After completing the development of the EquitX protocol, our go-to-market strategy will follow a phased approach:

-   Content marketing on Discord and X: during the development phase, we will and are already publishing content on Discord and X to build awareness and generate interest in the protocol. We will continue sharing updates and insights, ensuring the community stays engaged and informed as we progress toward launch.
    
-   Rewards and surprises for early users: to create hype and incentivize early adoption, we will announce and offer rewards to users who engage with the platform from the start. This strategy will build excitement around the launch and foster early community loyalty.
    
-   Liquidity injection from investors: to boost initial liquidity, we plan to seek investments for liquidity injection. This will provide a strong foundation for trading and stability pools, ensuring the platform has the liquidity needed to support early users and incentivize engagement.
    
-   Targeted user acquisition: after launch, we will focus on acquiring early adopters from the DeFi community, particularly those interested in synthetic assets and decentralized governance. For that, we may invest in paid marketing on social media to accelerate user growth and ensure broad exposure within the DeFi space.
    
-   Community engagement and governance: launching the governance system early will allow users to actively shape the platform's direction. We will encourage participation through token staking and voting, ensuring the community is deeply involved and rewarded for their engagement, fostering long-term loyalty.
    
-   Educational content and onboarding: to simplify the onboarding process, we will create educational materials such as guides, tutorials, and webinars. This will help users understand how to trade xAssets, participate in governance, and maximize their experience on the platform, fostering trust and usability.
    
-   Collaborations: with other DeFi projects (especially DEXs) of the ecosystem. This will also raise awareness about our protocol and extend our user base from existing Stellar users.
    

Our phased launch will start with governance token distribution and asset onboarding, followed by full functionality like trading and staking. By combining early community engagement through rewards, liquidity injection from investors, and targeted marketing, we will establish a strong initial user base and a stable liquidity environment.","Testnet and Development Phase

Comparable Protocol: 

Indigo Protocol is a decentralized platform on Cardano that creates synthetic assets, similar to EquitX’s approach. However, Indigo focuses on synthetic assets that are native to other blockchains, such as cryptocurrencies, rather than stocks like EquitX. While both platforms share similar technical processes, EquitX uniquely targets synthetic representations of small-cap equities on Stellar’s blockchain. Currently:

-   Indigo’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD stands at $33.81 million with a peak at $125.56 million in March 12, 2024, demonstrating the strong market demand for decentralized synthetic assets​  
    DefiLama
    
-   8,73 million of their stablecoin iUSD is circulating for a total market cap of $7,61 million  
    DefiLlama
    
    Retrospectively, only 2 months after launch, Indigo was at: 
    
-   14.37M TVL 
    
-   6.38M USD in iAssets 
    
-   935 CDPs

","Untangled Vault is an automated, non-custodial, data-driven asset management protocol enabling anyone to set and execute strategies to fit investor risk/return appetite. Untangled Vault is powered by Untangled pool, an asset tokenization protocol focusing on RWA private credits and Credio, a risk oracle providing machine learning model inferences and onchain monitoring of RWA. Untangled Vault is an EVM compatible smart contract platform. This application is to deploy Untangled Vault and necessary supporting components of Untangled Pool and Credio on Stellar. This necessitates the conversion of EVM contracts to Soroban as well as adapting and building all relevant technical components.

This presents a unique opportunity for Untangled Finance to make a impact, especially with the launch of the Soroban smart contract platform. RWAs (on any chain including Stellar) face challenges in moving beyond a mere, close-loop tokenisation to a landscape where tokens have more utility on secondary markets e.g. trading, used as collateral in lending markets or composed into products that fit investor risk, return and usage preferences. At Untangled and Credio, our risk modelling and oracle service, we believe these boils down to Product  * a liquid product that can achieve balance between risk, return and liquidity such as tokenized MMF, index funds or short term treasuries * a product that have a low barrier to entry e.g. minimum investment size or KYC particularly for emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Turkey, Ukraine and Nigeria * Stellar infrastructure primitives that can support such product innovations. Legal  * Token is tradable or used as collateral in third party systems after a possible short lock-up period * Minimum KYC requirement on secondary market beyond some compulsory require e.g. sanction list whitelisting Liquidity  * Who can provide liquidity for the secondary market? Think of market makers and other large liquidity providers  * What is optimal incentive design and quantum from the protocols concerned and  Stellar?

RWAs bring scale and stable and uncorrelated income for DAO, helping them to grow their treasury sustainably. However, some RWAs like private credits, whilst having higher yields and bigger real world impact, suffer from low liquidity ('no free lunch' principle in financial markets). With Untangled vault issuers can craft bespoke strategies for DAO treasuries, balancing yields and liquidity. We believe that this is a strong differentiation, currently lacking among RWA investment opportunities on Stellar. \* Institutional users: In a balanced portfolio, RWA yields are a source of stability that institutional users seek. We will be working with partners in our network including Fasanara, a big player in the digital asset market, to approach institutional investors in allocating liquidity to Untangled Vault. \* Retail users: Most currently RWA protocols (including our existing pool) set a high minimum investment amount.
