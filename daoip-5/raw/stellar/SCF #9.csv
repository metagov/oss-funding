The Stellar Development Foundation’s mission is to help maintain Stellar’s codebase, support the technical and business communities around Stellar, and act as a speaking partner to regulators and institutions. However, behind the ""nodes"" and ""anchors"" is the most crucial component to making the dream of financial inclusion a reality: People.

Creating an inclusive global community requires us to connect, communicate and learn from one another. A developer in France may find help from a #stellarfamily member in Germany. An entrepreneur in Mexico can find the answers she needs to launch her Stellar business from someone in Korea. We all can help one another. This is the focus Stellar Global is here to address.

Stellar Global was founded independently with a vision to become a 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to educate, connect and advocate for the millions of people that make up the human network of Stellar. It is our belief that Stellar has the potential to create equitable access for those previously excluded from the global financial landscape. Through exposure and education, we can ensure that the human network reflects the diverse world it is intended to serve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y9N-XHwfwo",,,www.Stellar-global.org,,https://youtu.be/Jnnnc3kN9Hg,,,,,,,Emir Ayral,,,,,
Tip me,SCF #9,tip me - the global tip,Tip me,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recrPNXsnMqfMFRXI,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$145000.00,$145000.00,541105.0,12/20/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,Connecting people of both ends of the global supply chain,"tip me

The next time you buy a t-shirt, you can tip the garment workers who made it. 100% of your tip is sent directly to the workers’ individual bank or mobile money accounts be it in Pakistan, Vietnam, or Kenya. Like this, consumers can directly impact the lives of the people who made their products. In only 30 min, brands can implement our tipping solution as a widget in their online shops. By using tip me, brands improve their customer loyalty, retention rates, and long-term revenue.

tip me creates a win-win-win situation for all stakeholders involved: On average, workers receive an additional income equivalent to a 13th monthly income. For the first time, they receive feedback from the end-customers who value their work. This changes not only their income but also their self-esteem. Consumers can give back directly and effectively, knowing that 100% of donations go where they should. They learn about the origin of a product. Companies can position themselves as responsible brands. Because of the unique emotional experience, consumers connect stronger with the brand and the products. This directly translates into higher revenue as the retention rates, shopping cart values, and referrals increase because of tip me.

In 2019, we launched our first pilots. From day one, our solution proved to be very attractive and successful both to consumers and our partner brands. The most important parts of the system have now been automated: we can onboard and administer thousands of workers effectively. Installing our solution into new online shops is fast and convenient. The bottleneck for us to reach millions of workers worldwide is the traditional banking sector. The high transfer fees, the administration overhead, and low transparency of the old system are big main pain points.

As Stellar has specialized in cross-border money transfer, it is the most attractive blockchain network available for our use case. The possibilities of the Stellar network, especially with its instant payments at an extremely low cost and high transparency, would be a breakthrough for the scalability of our mission. The automation of payments will decrease our administration overhead significantly.

Stellar will reduce the transaction cost of tip me by 90%. In our business model, brands pay these transfer fees. Especially for corporate brands with over 100,000 workers, these transaction costs from tip me amount to millions of USD per year. Stellar reduces them to a minimum. This new pricing made possible by Stellar will make the tip me product an absolute no-brainer for large brands looking for impact and marketing.

By reducing our administration overhead, tip me can reach 2x more workers with the same team size. Thanks to the inherent transparency of blockchain transactions, we can create a donation/tipping experience where consumers, workers, and brands can trace their impact in real-time. They can see proof that 100% of their tips have been sent to the wallets in question, instead of blindly trusting our organization.

The SCF grant will enable us to move the global tipping solution onto the Stellar network. Thanks to the blockchain capabilities, we can create truly borderless donations directly to individuals, safe and transparent. This investment creates another powerful real-world Stellar use case. It shows how Stellar enables new business models and donation solutions that would not be possible in the old banking system. It shows the potential of microtransactions and borderless payments by creating direct social impact for garment workers around the globe. It enables tip me to scale our impact to millions of workers.",,,https://tip-me.org,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NMk65_UvM,,,,,,,Helen Deacon,,,,,

Live, Work and GetPaid.","GetPaid is a place that connects creators, traders, and freelancers in Africa with worldwide opportunities. We do this through digital gigs, trade, education, and innovation. GetPaid exists out of a knowledge hub to learn, a community group to connect, and an app to get paid. GetPaid is a place built for our community, existing out of creators, traders, and freelancers.

The GetPaid team is an experienced team well known with Stellar and its technology, as we have operated ClickPesa for the last 3 years. In addition, we also know the African digital economy well. Bridging those two worlds is a perfect fit. Stellar’s open, low-fee network is what creators, traders, and freelancers in Africa need. However, just giving them the technology is not enough; a simple user interface on top of Stellar is what this group needs. GetPaid is the result.

Earlier this year, GetPaid started slowly validating assumptions through low-tech solutions. We technologize where needed, as technology is not always the answer, and try different ideas catered towards our community of creators, traders, and freelancers. This has resulted in a marketplace app open for African creators, traders, and freelancers whereby they can connect with global gig-providers and earn money. The marketplace app is utilizing Stellar’s ecosystem and technology where possible. Each registered user (creator and gig-provider) gets a Stellar account to store their received tokens in.

Although we started with a community group and an app to store tokens in, the GetPaid product is far from finished. We just started, whereby utilization of the Stellar account functionality is step 1. Considering many exciting developments are happening on the Stellar network, there have been identified many interesting use cases such as NFTs on the Stellar network (low fees compared to Opensea on Ethereum, affordable for Africa, our community already loves the idea), yield earning, escrow, and many others. The first step is accomplished and our community is guiding us on what they further need. We do this with a Stellar-first approach, utilizing its technology and ecosystem as much as possible. Think of directing more users to Litemint.com to sell NFTs and using Lobstr or Stellarterm to get access to other tokens.",,,https://getpaid.africa,,https://youtu.be/LVsojqIgcdg,,,,,,,Rick Groothuizen,,,,,

Simple Signer,SCF #9,Simple Signer,Simple Signer,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recjPfbs3ntu7RyaZ,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$10000.00,$10000.00,37317.0,12/17/2021,Legacy v3.0 Award,A secure in-browser transaction signer,"The Simple Signer project has one clear objective in mind: Reduce cognitive complexity to enter the Stellar ecosystem by providing a secure way to sign for Stellar transactions without installing a browser extension, and without providing your private key to the website that generates the transaction.

In order to operate with the Stellar network, a user must: Create a stellar account, buy XLM, and either install a browser extension or use their private key directly on the website where they wish to spend their assets. With many people still hampered by tech-illiteracy (or specifically crypto-illiteracy), the concept of installing a browser extension can be daunting: “Go into BrowserExtension website and create another account which will hold the keys for the Stellar account you just created, then install this browser extension and enter the details of your BrowserExtension account. You will use this browser extension to sign for transactions on other websites”, most users would find this user experience to be too convoluted. It is complex workflows like these that, in part, deter users from getting started in their Stellar journey.

However, “Enter your password to complete this operation” is very well understood by any user who has ever done any financial transaction online (including mainstream online banking). The only way to implement this workflow today is to use the private key directly on the website that generates the transaction, but users can’t be certain of what the website will actually do with their private key.

People are familiar with passwords; they have been around for a very long time, and anyone with internet access has had to use their password to authenticate at some point. Stellar Secret Keys are passwords in themselves (with the caveat that they cannot be changed). The cognitive load is greatly reduced if people simply enter their private key into a website, but at the same time exposes them to a security problem. What if the website is malicious? It could then use their private keys to perform unwanted transactions.

The Simple Signer is a simple, yet secure approach that tackles this problem. Hosted in a trusted website, the Simple Signer comes in the form of an HTML widget that takes a transaction and offers the user to sign it inside the widget using their private key. The Widget will then return the signed transaction to the requesting website, never exposing the user’s private key. The Simple Signer HTML Widget will be open-source to ensure transparency and auditability.

The Simple Signer Widget is a great entry point for crypto newbies to get started with the Stellar network; for the tech-savvy, it is no suitable replacement for browser extensions. Browser extensions are still extremely convenient as they allow multi-account handling and other advanced functions which are outside of the scope of this project (such as providing liquidity directly from the extension, as is the case with Albedo). Today there are many wallets for Stellar; Albedo, Freighter, Rabet, etc., and developers have to integrate their projects with each one of them in order to provide the best range. The Simple Signer will initially allow users to sign with their private key, but just as easily, it can allow users to connect their favourite wallet directly from the widget, and abstract the complexity of integrating with each individual wallet for Stellar developers, thus helping the community market their products faster.

The technical implementation that makes the Simple Signer is rather trivial. In its simplest form, by using an <iframe> that serves the Widget in a bespoke domain, the parent website cannot access its content or modify it as the communication happens from child to parent, meaning the Simple Signer Widget can communicate with the parent, but not vice-versa. The HTML Widget would take an XDR as a GET parameter, exactly like Stellar Laboratory and would present a user-friendly explanation of the operations that are happening inside that transaction. Finally, it will ask users to sign it and once done, invoke the window.parent.__handleSignedTransaction method and pass in the signed transaction as a parameter. In this way, the private key is never leaving the Widget’s site.",,,https://github.com/fsodano/simple-stellar-signer,,https://youtu.be/7wbBuwEHQYo,,,,,,,Fabricio Leonardo Sodano Pascazi,,,,,
