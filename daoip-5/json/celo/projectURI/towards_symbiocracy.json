    "description": "As a project that is at the beginning of its on-chain dimension, we are very pleased with the philosophical alignments we've found in the Celo blueprint (especially as detailed in https://www.notboring.co/p/celo-building-a-regenerative-economy). Therefore, it makes total sense for us to pivot our initial intentions of making use of other blockchain ecosystems towards an implementation with Celo. Such an implementation involves the creation of a set of smart contracts that can be triggered by an LLM agent behaving as the avatar for a river. Such agent, empowered by remote sensing data from the river and surrounding region, will  be mostly responsible for incentivizing human actions (from the local community) towards the benefit of the river. And considering the fact that such local community is rural and relies on mobile phones as their main digital interface, Celo's mobile centered approach seems very appropriate to our plans. ",
