We also co-facilitated the \"Empower Ladokites\" initiative by the institution where we spoke to over 4000 students about Crypto currency and Blockchain technology. We were recognized and given an award of honor by the institution for our impact.\n\nHackathon Participation: Engaged in 3 regional hackathons, with 5 student projects showcased and 2 projects recognized for innovative solutions.\n\nCollaborations: Partnered with over 5 blockchain projects (including CELO) for training, mentorship, and resources.\n\nOnline Engagement: Our X handle has garnered about 500 followers with consistent interactions and community engagement.\n\n\n\n\nQualitative Impact:\n\nSkill Development: Students report increased confidence in understanding blockchain concepts, writing smart contracts, and contributing to open-source projects.\n\nCareer Advancement: Some members have secured internships and job opportunities through our network and collaborations.\n\nInnovation: Students have created prototype dApps addressing local issues, demonstrating their understanding of blockchain applications.\n\nCommunity Building: Members express a strong sense of belonging, collaboration, and motivation to further explore blockchain technology.\n\nAwareness and Advocacy: We have helped demystify blockchain for students, reducing misconceptions and expanding their perspective on its potential beyond cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\nEducation, community engagement, and practical experience are at the heart of what we do, and as a result, Blockchain LAUTECH is taking baby steps to nurture the next generation of blockchain innovators. We strongly believe that it is possible to do great things from a small place.\n\n",

I was onboarded into Web3 in the Borderless Web3 Community. Since then, I have been an active Web3: Educator, Content Creator, Social Media Manager, and a Web3 Pressman.\n\nI am proposing the \u2018TheNewbiesCorner (TNC)\u2019 project, a Web3/Tech educational project designed to help students seamlessly transition into Tech and Web3. It simplifies complex Web3 concepts, breaking them down like explaining to a baby. Through a structured website, it provides free educational videos, explainers, workbooks, and eBooks. NewbiesCorner also supports Web2 professionals in integrating Web3 into their fields or transitioning to Web3. With a focus on simplicity , accessibility and clarity, it ensures that students from non-tech backgrounds can easily understand and leverage Web3 for their careers.\n\n### My Web3 Education and Onboarding Activities\nAfter my onboarding, I started off leading the Content Writing Team for Borderless 2.0. Afterwards I progressed to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem and onboarding Newbies at CRYPTOSMART, where we teach and help newbies to get started on their Web3 journey. I do this by hosting spaces, here's a few link to the spaces I hosted:\n\n- Guarding Against Crypto Scams: Securing your Wallets and Investments: >https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1766177128515576316?s=46\n-  Creating Wealth: Utilizing Airdrops and Wallets\n>https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1758567650307834181?s=46\n-  Leveraging Defi Opportunities in Africa:  >https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1LyxBnknnZPxN\n\n# Below are links to a few Long form contents I have written to Educate Newbies:\n- 3 Crypto Scams you should Avoid:\n>https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1761016202522964305?s=46\n- What to Look out for before buying your first Cryptocurrency: >https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1846882571877052815?s=46\n- Rules of Technical Analysis: >https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1772580804360609838?s=46\n\n- # Here's a link to a Web3 Trivia I came up with:\n>https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1844443262666592602?s=46\n\n- # Here's another link to some Web3 memes I created:\n>https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1756004371656053171?s=46\n>https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1832011727304638911?s=46\n\n\n\n### My Web3 Contribution as a Tech Club Lead @Borderless Tech Club, Uniport.\nI became the Club Lead for my University; Borderless Tech Club Uniport.

I started as a tutor in my teenage years and later transitioned into digital education when I discovered the MMO space.\n\nThat passion for teaching led me to create educational Web3 content\u2014breaking down complex concepts into digestible pieces.\n\n MY WEB3 JOURNEY\n\nI began with written content, crafting educational threads that simplified tough Web3 topics. One of my most notable pieces is a breakdown of DePINs, explaining the concept in an engaging and accessible way. \n- DePIN thread: https://x.com/OhwodiasaPraise/status/1880228344643613037?t=1-f9BNQpAGjbdiZM50L5qA&s=08\n\n\nBeyond writing, I hosted Twitter Spaces to guide beginners in their Web3 journeys, including 'Technical Writing 101,' where my guest and I provided mentorship for those serious about Web3 technical writing. \n\n- Technical Writing 101 space: https://x.com/OhwodiasaPraise/status/1870179018206511525?t=zmybeE94yNUxkVm1AhfW_Q&s=08\n\nGOING ALL IN ON BASE \ud83d\udd35\n\nIn Q4 2024, I made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Base.

I'll go through these department heads, visit at least 10 departments across 4 universities, and talk to them about the conference. Virtual sensitization will be done across these departments, where the link for registration will be sent to their department groups/forums. From there, I'll keep them engaged through emails as they sign up for the conference.\n\nIt is important to note that I have prior experience in marketing through emails, content, and other forms, as I was the head of the newsletter team and a part of the content, social media, and planning teams for Borderless 3.0. I played a vital part in Borderless 3.0's success. \n\nAnd, of course, I won't be doing this alone.\n\nI have close ties with the chairman of the Borderless 3.0 event, and I'll be working closely with him to ensure everything is done right. I already have a list of speakers on paper (I reached out to one, and he accepted to come speak at the conference when it's time)\u2014speakers with vast experience across the Web3 space.\n\nThe idea is: Web3 for everyone\u2014devs, content creators, and artists. Web3 is more than trading and doing airdrops, and this conference will help educate the attendees on this truth, demystify some of its complex concepts, and onboard some really exciting and talented young people into Web3.\n\n\nFrom breaking down Web3 concepts to designing viral onboarding experiences, I\u2019m fully committed to pushing Web3 adoption forward. \ud83d\ude80",
