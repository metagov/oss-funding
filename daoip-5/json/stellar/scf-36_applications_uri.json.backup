            "stellar.productsAndServices": "SendIN is a payments platform built on the Stellar network, designed to revolutionize the process of sending money from the US to India. We make US-to-India money transfers easy, affordable, transparent and lightning-fast without any crypto complexity. Funds can be sent to a recipient’s email, and INR is delivered directly to their Indian bank account within minutes. While the backend leverages Stellar’s low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure, the frontend remains entirely Web2-native. No wallets, seed phrases, or tokens required. SendIN brings the benefits of blockchain to users who never need to know it’s there. The tech’s complex. The experience isn’t.\n\nPreviously, we were awarded an activation award to build the phase 1 of our MVP on Stellar. We developed a fully functional application that enables a user in the US to send money to an email address, with the receiver in India getting INR directly in their bank account — all abstracting away blockchain complexity. Key technical accomplishments include:\n\n1.  A complete full-stack app with secure login, auth stack & database with email ↔ wallet mapping.\n    \n1.  Stellar SDK integration for transactions on the network & creating sponsored addresses.\n    \n1.  End-to-end money transfer orchestration on Stellar testnet. \n    \n1.  Partnerships & integrations with on/off-ramp providers (Kado.money, Onramp.money) to bridge USD ↔ USDC ↔ INR\n    \n1.  Custodial key management using AWS KMS and delegated signing of transactions\n    \n1.  Initial implementation of SEP-6 for anchor operations & SEP-12 for KYC storing and passing.\n    \n1.  Currently accepting users on our waitlist at sendin.app\n    \n\nIn Phase 2, we’re evolving SendIN from a functional MVP to a production-grade, corridor-scalable payments platform. A key challenge we faced in Phase 1 was the absence of a reliable Stellar anchor in India. After extensive exploration, we partnered with Onramp.money and collaborated with their team to build infrastructure for non-custodial USDC off-ramping—but the service remains SEP non-compliant and lacks full protocol alignment. On the on-ramp side, we had fully integrated with Kado.money, but following its recent acquisition and shift in services, we are now migrating to alternate providers. Phase 2 will address these limitations while expanding our infrastructure, formalizing compliance, and preparing for growth. Features / improvements in this phase include:\n\n1.  Build and deploy India’s first production-grade Stellar anchor to support off-ramping USDC & XLM → INR, including SEP-6, SEP-12, and SEP-31 compatibility.\n    \n1.  Add dynamic support for multiple on-ramp providers (Banxa, Transak) with backend routing based on user location, availability, and cost.\n    \n1.  Begin development of a Soroban smart contract layer to enable programmable disbursement logic, revenue-sharing models, and wallet restrictions. All complexity remains fully abstracted from users.\n    \n1.  Implement passkey-based authentication and migrated to a non-custodial approach by using dfns to use MPC infra for wallets and enhancing security while maintaining seamless UX.\n    \n1.  Continue onboarding users through the sendin.app waitlist and begin controlled mainnet rollout for transaction flows.",
            "stellar.usesSoroban": true,
            "stellar.successCriteria": "Success for SendIN is defined by both measurable traction and systemic impact.\n\nFrom a quantitative perspective, we aim to onboard 1000+ users across the US → India corridor within 3 months of mainnet launch, facilitating $200,000+ in cumulative remittance volume. This initial traction will validate product-market fit and prove that web2-native users can adopt a blockchain-powered backend without friction. We expect a growing share of users to be freelancers, remote workers, and NRIs with family ties in India; audiences underserved by traditional remittance channels.\n\nHowever, the deeper success lies in expanding access. By removing the need for crypto wallets, seed phrases, or exchange accounts, we’re onboarding entirely new cohorts into on-chain finance. The user experience is fully abstracted; money moves on Stellar, but users stay in their comfort zone.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, success includes the launch of India’s first SEP-compliant Stellar anchor which is currently a critical missing link in the ecosystem. We are positive that we could also market out the anchor at some point, which then could potentially be adapted by a lot of on-chain products in India",
            "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "SendIN will launch in four strategic phases, focused on the US → India remittance corridor, followed by groundwork for UAE expansion. Each phase targets a specific user group, validates infrastructure, and incrementally scales product adoption.\n\nPhase 1 – MVP (Early Q3 2025):  \nLaunch a minimal product to a small group of pilot users, enabling USD → INR remittances via email. Key goals: complete real transfers using Stellar infrastructure,  validate compliance (KYC, transaction flow), and gather UX feedback.\n\nPhase 2 – Closed Beta (Late Q3 2025):  \nOnboard select freelancers, expats, and early adopters from partner networks. Optimize flows and transaction reliability with real-world usage. Referral-based onboarding begins. KYC and INR disbursement experience refined with small-value transfers.\n\nPhase 3 – Full Launch US → India (Q4 2025):  \nLaunch to the public with full Web2-native UX and Stellar mainnet infrastructure. Users can send USD to emails; INR lands in recipient bank accounts within minutes. Roll out in-app referrals, transparent pricing, and FX efficiency as core value props.\n\nPhase 4 – UAE → India Groundwork (Q1 2026):  \nBegin integrating multi-currency backend logic and initiate partnerships with UAE-based payment providers. Build compliance readiness for corridor expansion.  \n  \nAcquisition Channels:\n\n-   Partner with freelancer platforms (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr)\n    \n-   In-app referral incentives for NRI users and diaspora communities\n    \n-   Tie-ups with alumni networks, Indian expat orgs\n    \n-   BD with remote payroll tools (e.g. Deel)\n    \n-   Content marketing on cost-saving, remittance pain points",
            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "SendIN was awarded an SCF Activation Award during SCF #27, which allowed us to build and rigorously test an almost full-featured prototype on Stellar testnet. Since then, our project has steadily validated both technical and market feasibility. To date, over 550 users have joined our waitlist, primarily Indian-origin freelancers, remote workers, and expats. This growth has been entirely organic: driven through Discord, fintech Twitter, diaspora communities, and word of mouth, without any paid marketing. For privacy and compliance reasons, we are unable to share individual user data publicly, but we maintain all relevant KYC and waitlist submissions securely on our backend.\n\nTo further validate user needs, we conducted 30+ structured interviews with potential angel users and stakeholders in the remittance space, which shaped our onboarding and product design. These conversations revealed deep dissatisfaction with existing payment rails and strong excitement for a faster / cheaper experience. We found out people don’t really care about the tech behind given that it’s powerful & safe.\n\nOn the institutional side, we've also been approached by multiple early-stage VCs and fintech scouts, intrigued by our positioning at the intersection of Web2 usability and blockchain-native infra. These conversations are ongoing but signal real interest from the capital side once we’re closer to mainnet traction.\n\nSendIN was also invited to pitch at Stellar Meridian 2024 in London, where the project received enthusiastic feedback from members of the Stellar Development Foundation, ecosystem founders, and protocol engineers. Together, these signals, a growing waitlist, structured validation, ecosystem visibility, and investor interest, reflect early traction for a product that solves a real, painful problem in a $15B+ corridor.",

            "stellar.tractionEvidence": "SeevCash’s journey to Web 3 began with two recurring user questions: “When will I be able to receive money from abroad?” and “Can I send money home with SeevCash?” As founders, we also grappled with a critical issue: “How can we shield our users’ money from the Ghana Cedi’s ongoing devaluation?” These challenges drove us to join the Stellar Bootcamp, where we collaborated with the Stellar Foundation and the Bigger Tech team to refine our vision. There, we discovered that high transaction fees frustrated many users, prompting us to prioritize affordability. This experience, aligned with Stellar’s mission of accessible finance, gave birth to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\n\nSince launching in March 2023, we’ve achieved the following metrics while bootstrapping, with our P2P feature and payment system going live in Q4 2024 after wining Stellar Kickstart grant of $15,000. Beside User Growth, all data provided is from Q4 2024 to April 2025, reflecting rapid early growth:\n\nUser Growth: Acquired 14,210 users organically (zero CAC) through social media, referrals, events, and word of mouth from March 2023 to April 2025, leading to 1,795 Active Users. This represents a 12.6% conversion rate from acquired users to active users.\n\nTransactions: Processed $75,000 across 1,967 transactions, averaging $38 per transaction.\n\nRevenue: Generated $1,360 from a 1.1%–1.6% transaction fee depending on the transaction type and 50% of revenue from an ad-driven reward system, where users earn incentives for engaging with ads to offset transaction fees. This early revenue validates our model’s potential.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (LTV): We are actively calculating LTV as we refine our monetization strategy with early estimates at $10 per active user based on transaction frequency.\n\nDespite limited resources, we’ve maintained lean operations by leveraging free marketing channels and are exploring partnerships with local fintechs, telcos and small business owners to scale user acquisition. Moving forward, we plan to boost our activation rate to 20% through enhanced onboarding with in-app tutorials and scale revenue to $5,000 monthly by Q3 2025 by introducing new revenue streams.\n\nMeanwhile, we are excited to share a mainnet demo we released for our integration so far.",

            "stellar.productsAndServices": "LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and interoperability oracle network that connects liquidity across siloed blockchains. It is powered by a decentralized oracle relay network infrastructure and focuses on bridging assets securely and cost-effectively between EVM-compatible chains and Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem.\n\nInteroperability has long been a challenge in blockchain development. Many existing solutions prioritize asset transfers between isolated chains, often introducing a single point of failure. While oracle-based inter-chain messaging protocols like Chainlink help relay data across chains, they primarily support EVM-based blockchains, leaving non-EVM ecosystems like Soroban without robust interoperability options.\n\nLiquidsFi addresses this gap by developing a secure and efficient EVM-Soroban interoperability data transmission oracle network and asset bridge.\n\nBy enabling seamless liquidity transfers between EVM chains and Soroban, LiquidsFi enhances capital efficiency, dApp accessibility, and overall adoption of Soroban-based assets. Users who previously relied on EVM networks for interoperability can now securely transfer assets and access DeFi opportunities on Soroban, ultimately driving higher on-chain activity and TVL growth.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe key features of LiquidsFi include:\n\n#### 1. Decentralized, Non-Custodial Liquidity protocol\n\n-   Powered by community-supplied on-chain liquidity\n    \n-   Fully non-custodial model enhances trust and transparency\n    \n-   Liquidity providers earn LP rewards and token incentives\n    \n-   Aligns token incentives with Stellar/Soroban adoption\n    \n\n#### 2. Dedicated EVM ↔ Soroban Interoperability\n\n-   Custom-built infrastructure for EVM-Soroban bridging\n    \n-   Supports Lock-and-Release + Lock-and-Mint mechanisms\n    \n-   Optimized for seamless token, NFT, and data transmission\n    \n\n#### 3. Multichain Token Integration API\n\n-   Projects can easily integrate their tokens into the bridge\n    \n-   Includes support for:\n    \n    -   Metadata registration\n        \n    -   Custom minting configurations\n        \n    -   Liquidity pair initialization\n        \n    -   Bridge fee customization\n        \n\n#### 4. On-Chain Oracle Data Bridging\n\n-   Enables oracle-based data transmission between chains\n    \n-   Ideal for DeFi, analytics, and real-world data applications\n    \n-   Supports custom data routing for advanced dApp use cases\n    \n\n#### 5. NFT Bridging with Metadata Support\n\n-   Native support for NFTs + metadata across chains\n    \n-   Allows Soroban-based NFT platforms to access EVM marketplaces and vice versa\n    \n\n#### 6. Infrastructure Layer for Soroban Projects\n\n-   Simplifies cross-chain functionality for Stellar-based dApps\n    \n-   Helps non-EVM-native tokens and protocols become multichain\n    \n-   Boosts accessibility and liquidity reach for Soroban projects\n    \n\nEcosystem Impact\n\nThe impact LiquidsFi has on the Stellar ecosystem is as follows:\n\n#### For Developers:\n\n-   Launch Soroban-native tokens with built-in cross-chain functionality\n    \n-   Access liquidity and user bases on major EVM chains\n    \n-   Build oracle-powered dApps with real-time multichain data feeds\n    \n\n#### For the Stellar Network:\n\n-   Drives TVL and active usage of Soroban smart contracts\n    \n-   Expands Stellar’s role as a DeFi-capable Layer 1 beyond payments\n    \n-   Encourages native project growth with first-class interoperability support\n    \n\n#### For the Community:\n\n-   Incentivizes participation through LP staking and liquidity mining\n    \n-   Offers transparent, non-custodial infrastructure for secure asset bridging\n    \n-   Enables NFT creators, dApp builders, and DeFi developers to grow multichain",

            "stellar.goToMarketPlan": "LiquidsFi has developed a robust and proven go-to-market strategy, inspired by successful models implemented by leading interoperability and DeFi protocols. The core focus of our approach is participation incentivization — ensuring early adoption, user retention, and sustained ecosystem engagement.\n\n#### 1. Liquidity Mining Incentives\n\nAt the heart of LiquidsFi is a multichain liquidity protocol and non-custodial bridge, which relies on active liquidity provision. To bootstrap liquidity and reward early users, LiquidsFi will launch a liquidity mining rewards program. This initiative will:\n\n-   Attract early adopters by providing yield opportunities on idle stablecoins and other assets\n    \n-   Boost available liquidity for seamless cross-chain asset bridging\n    \n-   Foster long-term engagement by rewarding consistent participation\n    \n\n#### 2. Point-Based Token Rewards\n\nLiquidsFi will implement a point-based token reward system, similar to a loyalty or cashback program. Users earn points (redeemable for tokens) when bridging assets through the protocol. This system is designed to:\n\n-   Incentivize repeat usage of the bridge\n    \n-   Improve user retention through ongoing rewards\n    \n-   Encourage organic growth as users are rewarded for continued activity\n    \n\n#### 3. Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem Integration\n\nTo accelerate adoption, LiquidsFi will form strategic partnerships within the Soroban and Stellar ecosystems. These efforts include:\n\n-   Integrations with Soroban-based dApps and DeFi platforms to expand use cases\n    \n-   Cross-marketing collaborations with ecosystem projects to leverage community overlap\n    \n-   Active participation in Soroban and Stellar growth initiatives and hackathons\n    \n\n#### 4. Community Engagement & Incentivized Programs\n\nLiquidsFi will prioritize community-driven growth by launching targeted engagement campaigns, including:\n\n-   Bounty Programs: Security and community bounties to encourage contributions and feedback\n    \n-   Marketing Collaborations: Partnering with KOLs, crypto influencers, and media outlets to amplify visibility\n    \n-   Education & Awareness Campaigns: Hosting AMAs, producing educational content, and organizing onboarding workshops to grow the user base\n    \n\nBy combining liquidity incentives, token-based rewards, strategic partnerships, and community engagement, LiquidsFi is positioned to achieve rapid adoption, deep protocol liquidity, and strong developer and user traction from the outset. This multi-pronged strategy ensures both immediate impact and long-term sustainability.",
