OTC Traders looking for a secure way to do large scale transactions without having to hold/swap on a liquidity pool. Today CEX's (as we have seen with numerous limitations) hold the market share on P2P Transactions and are not scalable in emerging and developed economies because of the various regulations and bureaucracy surrounding them. Trust still remains a major factor in P2P Payments. Counterparty risks and really slow settlement times. Stellar doesn't have a DeFi Incentivized protocol focused on stablecoins. These marketplaces are so static and rigid and are not flexible enough for under the hood automatic liquidity provision.

Our Solution:

Build: As global FX activity grows, Centralized players become increasingly fragmented. No Decentralized alternative yet. We’re bringing the full $805B FX market on-chain. Payments layer (LINK Business, DFX), FX focused liquidity layer (WAVY), Yields Layer (USDC, EURC, CADC, BRZ). WAVY is eliminating this by enabling peer-to-peer payments to be instant, secure and incentivized. P2P: OTC powered by a trustless escrow smart contract. Swap: Stablecoin swaps powered by WAVY'S P2P Marketplace, Soroswap etc. Spend: Stablecoin digital debit card. Bridge: Stablecoin transfer across blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Stellar, Avalanche). Top Up & withdraw: Compliant local on & off ramps (For Consumer: SEP6/24, Bank Transfer, MoneyGram, VISA, Interac, Google Pay) (For Businesses: LINK Business).

By leveraging partnerships with stablecoin anchors to enable said on & off-ramps. This also in turn boosts the respective anchors activity on Stellar. Permissionless on and off ramps leveraging anchor partnerships on the network (on the roadmap as well would be to build sort of a bridge on soroban smart contract that would allow cross chain). FOCUS IS BUILDING the Largest Stablecoin P2P Marketplace where users get to buy/sell stablecoins with other stablecoins at their own terms, in this case we are building our own asset trustless set of escrow contracts on Soroban that would hold the both stables that lets the both users sign through their wallets with/without the other counterparty.

Think of it as a decentralized Binance P2P Place but for stablecoins where users can buy a stablecoin of their choice (from the Vendor or Ad) and off-ramp that to a local payment method using the inbuilt ramp feature unique to the anchors. Or use the bridge feature powered by the soroban smart contract to send it across different chains.

Even with the new policies Argentina has been implementing which kept the ARS at USD 1:ARS 1000 for nearly four months, recently the ARS has again devalued from USD 1:1000 to USD 1:1300 (30% depreciation) almost overnight. See: https://cuex.com/en/usd-ars_pa At SGF (SGF Solutions SRL), we have 12 years of providing financial solutions to Argentinians, and through our well-established network of retail and corporate clients, we are able to provide double the liquidity in ARS and USD than the other two providers combined, monthly; our relevant monthly volumes are ~ARS 600M (7.2bn/yr) in bank transfers (payouts) which are exchanged from ~USD 500,000/month (6M/yr) and smaller volumes of crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT) totalling ~USD 100,000. Our operating fees, while dynamic, are generally between 0% and 1%. We believe this is a good fit for the Stellar network, which prides itself on providing low fees for financial transactions. While not relevant to this application, we also provide remittances from Argentina to Spain, which has seen a significant uptake in the last few years as the emigration rates increased due to Argentina’s poor economic conditions. It’s important to clarify that we are not looking to issue our own ARS asset, but rather to improve the interoperability of the Stellar blockchain by accepting Stellar’s USDC and off-ramping ARS directly to bank accounts and digital wallets (CBU’s and CVU’s such as MercadoPago, see https://www.bcra.gob.ar/MediosPago/Politica_Pagos-i.asp). SGF proposes building an application that leverages the Stellar Anchor Platform and SEP-24 to accept USDC and offramp ARS. This is supported in SEP-24 as per this pull request https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1064, and we quote: “This protocol was originally designed to provide conversions between off-chain and on-chain equivalent assets – for instance BRL <> BRLT, USD <> USDC, NGN <> NGNT, etc. – but it has been updated to make exchanges between off-chain and on-chain non-equivalent assets like BRL <> USDC.“ Our use case is USDC <> ARS (one-way, to begin with).

Problem

According to a Bloomberg report, the audio-visual industry in Africa faces significant challenges due to the high cost and limited accessibility of gear and studio spaces for creators to execute audio-visual projects. It's estimated that the audio-visual industry loses approximately USD 1.2 billion yearly due to these barriers. Additionally, the lack of professional workshops, audio-visual production courses, and training hampers the productivity and profitability of African creators.

Solution

Gearup solves this problem through a peer-2-peer marketplace application that lets creators across Africa have seamless access to quality gear, studio spaces, and professional courses they need to bring their vision to life without the burden of high purchasing costs. We do this by leveraging blockchain technology to track and trace gear, courses, and studio trades and reward good actions in the trading process to ensure security, speed, and transparency.

Additional Information

Gearup offers a decentralized investment opportunity for both creators and non-creators to invest in high-demand gear and list them on the marketplace to generate passive income from rentals. In addition, our comprehensive insurance coverage helps to protect gear owners from all forms of eventualities. This innovative model allows anyone to invest and participate in the creative economy.

The Opportunity

Building Gearup on the Stellar network offers unparalleled opportunities for marketplace applications due to Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions and robust security features. Stellar Network will enhance Gearup's efficiency in handling micro-transactions and on-chain tracking of gear movement from person to person. In addition, Stellar's infrastructure ensures transparency, reduces operational costs, and enables seamless integration with financial institutions built on Stellar. In return, Stellar Network will benefit from Gearup through automatic onboarding of Gearup users into the Stellar Network, increased transaction volume and network activity which can enhance liquidity and network robustness. Gearup's adoption will attract more users, particularly creators, gear and studio owners, and businesses to Stellar Network, thereby fostering a larger ecosystem.",,,https://gearup.market,https://github.com/Gearup-Market,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN-jMhERphQ,,,,,,,Obasi Francis,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/gearupmarket,https://twitter.com/Gearupmarket,,

GiveCredit's pilot initiative is offsetting the total carbon dioxide emissions from the Stellar blockchain ecosystem, partnering with SCF grantees StellarCarbon (who are providing carbon credits sourced from Verra, a leading carbon credit provider) and PublicNode (a 501(c)3 nonprofit providing blockchain infrastructure accepting donations to make Stellar fully carbon neutral).

GiveCredit solves different problems for different customer demographics. For donors: It allows them to reduce crypto-related tax fees such as capital gains by making tax-deductible donations for negligible fees, while also making a verifiable positive impact on the environment. For nonprofits: It opens a new source of funding, as well as enabling them to a positive impact on the environment (such as offsetting the emissions from their work). For blockchain carbon projects: it provides a stream of revenue- people to buy the tokenized credits they are offering! For interested third parties such as governments, corporations and foundations- it provides a way to crowdfund carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and other emissions offset initiatives, as well as a source of data about positive environmental impact being made by citizens and nonprofits. For the planet and humanity: Donations through GiveCredit help fund ecosystem preservation and other forms of positive environmental impact.

How GiveCredit Works: First, the user chooses a project in the GiveCredit app, and goes through the payment flow to send a cryptocurrency donation for the desired amount. At this point, the user can elect to mint an NFT containing the donation details in the metadata as well as to receive a receipt email for tax purposes. The NFT is minted on Soroban using a modified ERC-721 contract.

Second, the donation flows to the nonprofit, where it is then divided by Soroban smart contract. A portion, typically 10%, is retained by the nonprofit to cover administrative fees and overhead, and the remainder used to retire carbon credits. The remaining funds are sorted by Soroban smart contract into “buckets” corresponding to the price of one carbon credit, after which they are transmitted to the carbon credit provider (in this case, StellarCarbon).

Third, when funds are received by StellarCarbon, they retire carbon credits for the given amount and expose the retirement data in their API, to be accessed by GiveCredit. Finally, GiveCredit’s hook system retrieves retirement information and mints it automatically by Soroban smart contract as an NFT under the appropriate initiative, forming a verifiable connection between the donation and the emissions offset.

Donation, donor identity, NFT, and carbon credit data are stored in GiveCredit's registry database to create a full record of all behavior, display up-to-date data (e.g. carbon credit price, initiative progress) and ensure reliable and efficient performance within the GiveCredit app.",,,https://givecredits.cfce.io/,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqSn07fPMqDtFnh6Bc6MUcH3yTHL2UIe/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,Evan Cooper Hudson,,,https://x.com/c4collabecon,,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Rs3PAyj7fjI-Q6fCk5jVdqLukWxrCcy9ZORQrkQI18/edit?usp=sharing

The problem
The app addresses the issue of Utility for stablecoins beyond remittance and cross-border payment.

Functionalities
The app offers two distinct functionalities which are:

Bill payment which covers common utility services like airtime, data subscription, savings etc. and Service payment like gig payment for freelancers and NGOs.

For bill payment we will make the following available using USDC and EURC on Stellar:

Airtime purchase
Buy data subscription
Pay electricity bill
Pay for cable TV
Buy Gift Card

For services users will be able to:

Donate and support public service/goods through our simple application interface
Freelancers can create a gig link they can share and get paid

How it works
This is how a user will use the Utoken web app to settle their bill using USDC in their wallet:

The user visits the website and launches the Utoken web app
The user connects any of the supported Stellar non-custodian wallets like Exodus using SimpleSigner
The user chooses a location and the service they are interested in paying for e.g Data Subscription
The user enters the amount they want to pay, their service ID e.g Subscriber number and the stablecoin of their choice to use
The user initiates payment and signs a transaction request which is done through Simplesigner
The transaction is approved in the connected wallet after which the user is redirected to the Utoken app. The transaction involves sending the token of choice (USDC) from the user's Wallet to the Utoken multi-sig address on the Stellar Blockchain
Bill is initiated from the app and the transaction status is shown to users
Bill payment is done and the user gets notified through their service provider. For example, they receive a top-up notification from their local telecommunication company

This is how a user will pay for services:

The user visits the website and launches the Utoken web app
The user connects any of the supported Stellar non-custodian wallets like Exodus using SimpleSigner
The user selects the gig button or donate button
They search for a service provider of their choice and click on it
The user enters the amount they want to pay and some relevant info for communication
The user initiates payment and signs a transaction request which is done through Simplesigner
The transaction is approved in the connected wallet and the user is redirected to the Utoken app. The transaction involves sending the token of choice (USDC) from the user's Wallet to a multisig address for payment splitting or escrow service.
In the case of gig, the service provider (the freelancer) gets notified with the gig link which can be used to request release of funds. The user (paying for the service) can also release funds using the gig link.

Target Users
The product targets:

Crypto natives
Freelancers

Our pursuit of this idea stemmed from personal experiences seeking ways to safeguard and grow wealth amidst economic volatility. Traditional financial solutions like mobile money and banks proved inadequate, leading us to explore alternatives.

Cryptocurrencies emerged as a potential remedy, but their complexity and the focus of platforms like Coinbase and MetaMask on card users excluded many. Despite digital transaction growth during the pandemic, challenges like high fees and fragmented infrastructure remained, making cross-border payments difficult—an issue still experienced by Richard and me, along with millions of African workers.

The pandemic underscored the limitations of mobile money, as services like Spotify and Netflix required cards, excluding many youth. A survey of 350 people showed high demand for these services among underserved youth. Observing these gaps, we leveraged our expertise in mobile payments and blockchain, and my cofounder's legal background, to create a solution. We identified blockchain, stablecoins, and innovative card distribution as key to addressing Africa's financial issues.

We assembled a team to tackle technical and regulatory challenges, aiming to empower millions of underserved African youth with access to financial services, wealth preservation, and global economic participation. Our solution is a stablecoin app that lets users open dollar accounts on their smartphones, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. Users get virtual and physical debit cards linked to their balance, enabling online and offline transactions. The app allows free, instant P2P transfers and offers savings, yield earning, and borrowing against savings, helping users preserve wealth amidst economic volatility.

The app also introduces users to cryptocurrency investment, simplifying the process while maintaining blockchain benefits. Our strategy focuses on Africa due to its unique financial landscape and the potential for transformative change through blockchain and stablecoin adoption. Africa's high internet and smartphone penetration support this integration, mirroring successes seen in regions like Latin America. Our goal is to foster financial inclusion and empowerment for Africa's youth, driving socio-economic transformation across the continent.

How we use Soroban:
- Connect to Blend Liquidity protocol to allow users to earn yield on their USDC
- Plan to create our own liquidity pool through Blend

Go To Market:

To allow Grip users to be able to hold fiat in supported currencies, each currency has its own pouch (this supplements linking accounts directly). We extend this to enable stellar support by setting up custody wallets and muxed accounts under a pooled account, enabling users to hold and interact with assets like XLM and USDC on Stellar.

Problems Solved:
- Singular Interface for Fiat & Crypto: Simplifies user financial interaction.
- Cost Efficiency: Reduces overhead on users by avoiding individual account creation using multiplexed accounts.
- Asset Holding: Provides secure asset custody for users.

Benefits:
- Quick, secure access to Stellar assets for our users.
- Lower complexity and cost in account management for our users.

How It Works:
- Pooled Account with Muxed IDs: Uses a single base account with unique muxed IDs for user transactions.
- Trustlines: Establishes trustlines for various assets based on user requests.
- Stellar CAP-27: Implements multiplexed account management as per Stellar's CAP-27.

Card Payments

To allow Grip users to be able to make local and international payments with the multi-currency cards we issue to them. They can pay from their pouch balances or directly from their linked financial accounts (a sample of this is shown in the video). This integration will extend our card payment capabilities and enable users to link their stellar wallets on CEX, DEX, and on Grip to physical and virtual cards we issue for seamless payments using Stellar assets like XLM and USDC.

Problems Solved:
- Financial Interoperability: Connects traditional card payments with blockchain assets.
- Flexibility: Lets users switch payment methods within the app.
- Liquidity Management: Simplifies managing liquidity for transactions with Stellar assets.

Benefits:
- Cardholders can use blockchain assets for daily transactions effortlessly.
- Merchants can accept payments from users with Stellar assets, increasing their customer base.

How It Works:
- Wallet Integration: Stellar wallets set as payment options in the app.
- Real-Time Validation: Validates wallet balances for transaction authorization.
- Stellar Anchors: Uses Stellar Anchors for off-ramping transaction values to fiat.

Open Banking Service

Grip has an in-house open banking infrastructure that was built to extend our service provider coverage to be the most extensive in the market and to also allow for cost-effective transaction spooling, transaction initiation, and to easily enable other features and use cases we might need to support in the future. This feature would extend Grip's OB infra to include integrations with centralized and decentralized exchanges, enabling seamless on-chain and off-chain asset management.

Problems Solved:
- Liquidity Management: Simplifies managing liquidity across platforms.
- Financial Control: Centralizes control of finances, including on-chain transactions.
- Interoperability: Enhances connectivity between traditional finance and blockchain networks.

Benefits:
- Users: Manage financial assets across multiple platforms easily.
- Financial Institutions: Offer enhanced services by integrating traditional and blockchain finance.

How It Works:
- API Integrations: Connects with CEX and DEX providers using APIs.
- Transaction Management: Synchronizes transaction history and initiates transactions.
- Stellar Wallet Linking: Links Stellar wallets for seamless asset management.",,,https://trygrip.co,,https://youtu.be/_HcTOFxhWW8,,,,,,,Nelson Nelson-Atuonwu,,https://linkedin.com/in/trygripapp,https://twitter.com/trygripapp,,

Like the Stellar Development Foundation, Neovestor aims to address the inequities of the mainstream financial system, particularly in underserved communities. It uses blockchain technology to create a system that is more inclusive, affordable and straightforward.

The problem we’re solving

Neovestor polled more than 300 investors (aged 18-55) and found that eight in 10 want access to real-world asset (RWA) opportunities but face several barriers:

Distrust and Cost: 57% feel excluded by traditional finance, primarily due to distrust and high minimum investments (46%).

Readiness to Invest: About half are comfortable starting with $100 to $500 investments.

Community and Learning: 54% trust family and friends most, yet 71% strongly demand educational content.

Solution:

Neovestor empowers investors by providing affordable and accessible RWA opportunities and enhancing financial literacy:

Affordability: Offers entry-level access starting at USD10, and the ability to earn stable-coin yields.

Accessibility: Invests in proven real-world assets and businesses.

Education: Delivers mobile-first, customised content to help investors make informed decisions.

Why Now? And Who?

Initial Target Market:

Neovestor targets 130 million underserved potential investors in Southeast Asia, specifically Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Collectively, they own ~USD650 billion in cash deposits.

Market Opportunity:

Demographics: These markets have large, youthful populations (median age 25-40) totalling over 550 million.

Low Investment Participation: Around 1-2% of these populations are investing.

Financial Inclusion: Between 23% and 48% are unbanked yet equipped with payment onramps.

Tech Adoption: Mobile usage exceeds 72% across these markets, while each ranks among the top 10 for crypto adoption globally.

Economic Factors: Many of these markets have experienced significant inflation, making USD stablecoin investments an attractive hedge.

Investment focus

Neovestor focuses on established businesses led by seasoned operators across robust sectors, including transportation, logistics, sustainable agriculture, consumer services, and energy.

Initial RWA offerings

A private car service based in the UAE

A poultry farm based in Indonesia

Target returns of 7 - 10% per annum

Expanding Neovestor’s RWA Portfolio of Offerings

To build and scale our Real World Asset (RWA) offerings, Neovestor will utilise six main strategies:

Ensuring the Success of Existing Projects: Strengthening the Neovestor brand through the oversubscription of current offerings.

Referrals from Partners: Encouraging partners to refer additional projects through shared economics arrangements and cross-promotional activities.

Establishing New Partnerships: Collaborating with other RWA projects and platforms (such as generalist launchpads, AMMs, asset tokenisation platforms, etc).

OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,SCF #28,OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,OCTO ultimate SocioFi NFT hub,Applications,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec59dhu7lEcLfHwR,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$40500.00,$40500.00,463774.09,7/10/2024,Legacy v5.0 Activation Award,OCTO is a super dApp that revolves around NFT and digital assets with a strong emphasis on creators and their communities.,"Our project, OCTO, named after the octopus, reflects our vision and platform functionality. OCTO aims to be the ultimate NFT hub focusing on creators' content and their communities. Despite differing opinions on NFTs as digital assets, their permanence and evolving use cases are undeniable. Here are some key foundations of OCTO:

Limited and/or Fractioned Functionality: Popular blockchains like Ethereum or Solana offer a variety of NFT-related services, but even these require multiple platforms for basic actions. Other blockchains, including Stellar, lack a convenient all-in-one platform, causing wasted time/money, unnecessary friction, and potential for fraud.

Lack of Engagement / Crypto Tribalism: Successful NFT projects need to outreach, engage, and onboard users. However, different standards and blockchain interoperability issues force NFT creators to choose between their favorite blockchain or a more NFT-centric one for a larger audience. This crypto tribalism draws quality projects from blockchains like Stellar to Ethereum or Solana.

Content Creator Economy: As the 'flipper economy' declines, NFT collectors seek projects with immediate and long-term benefits. Entertainment and content take center stage, yet there is typically no method to share content with the project's community safely, timely, and conveniently. Creators often resort to custom-built websites or multiple platforms to achieve basic results. The content creator economy of NFT projects should be rewarded to incentivize quality projects.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: The often-overused concepts of Maslow's pyramid of hierarchy are representative of NFT communities, particularly the 'Love and Belongingness' and 'Self-actualization' layers. These explain one's aspiration to be part of exclusive communities and engage with peers.

Problem & Areas of Improvement

Research on Stellar NFTs revealed several improvement areas we aim to address:

1. Lack of Latest NFT ERC-Compliant Standards on Soroban: This issue causes unnecessary friction for users.
2. Insufficient Functionality of Other NFT Marketplaces: Existing marketplaces offer limited functionality compared to OCTO and often operate as custodial services, limiting true asset control.
3. Lack of Community Building and Engagement: Current Stellar-oriented marketplaces do not focus on community building, engagement, or other aspects of Gamification and SocioFi of the NFT experience.

OCTO's Solutions & Benefits

The product is property-testing based formal verification for Soroban smart contracts. This enables developers to write Rust property tests and not just fuzz over them, but formally verify them, to achieve the highest level of assurance for their codebase.

The problem being solved is that formal verification is difficult for many engineers to get started with, but by taking a property-testing approach, Runtime Verification is lowering the barrier to entry. This allows developers to include formal verification in their normal quality assurance processes, even enabling it on CI, using our open source tooling. One example of the success of this is when Amazon enabled formal verification of C code using C property tests (and CBMC for model checking). They had great success getting normal C developers to do formal verification at a much larger scale than previously by using the property-testing based approach.

Our tool uses KWasm to do symbolic execution of compiled Soroban smart contracts. There is tooling for turning Rust-level property tests into WebAssembly code (via the compiler), and then into KWasm based verification challenges. Once the verification is complete (passed, failed, or unsure), the result is translated back to the Rust level for developers to understand the next step. This keeps developers in their own workflow, rather than asking them to step outside of it. This first activation award is focused on specializing KWasm to Soroban by implementing the Soroban host functions.",,,https://kasmer.runtimeverification.com,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0f3N39DGMw,,,,,,,Paul Len,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3142238/,https://twitter.com/rv_inc,https://discord.gg/CurfmXNtbN,

Sorodrop eliminates this inefficiency by providing ready-made airdrop functionality, ensuring no team has to start from scratch again. Inefficient Distribution: Existing methods are slow and can't handle large recipient numbers effectively. High Costs: High gas fees make large-scale token and NFT distribution expensive. Lack of Automation: Manual interventions increase errors and reduce efficiency. Resource Wastage: Unclaimed tokens or NFTs often go to waste without a clawback mechanism. Rigidity in Distribution: Current solutions lack flexibility to pause, resume, or stage airdrops as needed.

Sorodrop caters to various groups within the Stellar ecosystem: Project Owners: Launching new tokens or NFTs and needing a cost-effective way to distribute them widely. Developers: Seeking robust tools for efficient token and NFT distribution without high costs. Community Managers: Rewarding community members efficiently and transparently. Marketers: Conducting promotional campaigns to attract or retain users through airdrops. Fundraisers: Using airdrops to support fundraising events and achieve milestones.

As an example, we recently had an exploratory conversation with the growing Token Tails community. They need to airdrop their tokens and NFTs to over a thousand addresses. Currently, this isn’t possible on Stellar without manual effort or writing a custom contract. This need is already evident in the ecosystem, and it will become more apparent as more projects and communities grow on Stellar. SoroDrop will save teams and SCF thousands of dollars and hours of work.

Solving this problem will positively impact the Stellar ecosystem: Increased Adoption: Easier, cost-effective distribution attracts more projects to the Stellar network. Enhanced Engagement: Efficient airdrops foster higher community engagement and participation. Innovation Encouragement: Reliable distribution tools encourage developers to innovate on Stellar. Resource Optimization: Clawback functionality prevents resource wastage, boosting ecosystem efficiency. Market Expansion: Projects reach larger audiences without technical and financial constraints, growing the user base and market penetration for Stellar-based assets.

Sorodrop streamlines the creation and distribution of tokens and NFTs on the Stellar network using the Soroban framework. Sorodrop addresses the aforementioned issues in several ways: Efficient Distribution through Merkle Trees: Sorodrop uses Merkle tree structures to handle large-scale airdrops efficiently, reducing computational load and ensuring quick, accurate distribution. Cost Reduction: The platform minimizes gas fees, making token and NFT claims more affordable. Automation and User-Friendly Interfaces: Sorodrop automates airdrop execution by allowing CSV uploads of recipient addresses, reducing errors and enhancing efficiency. Resource Optimization through Clawback Functionality: Unclaimed tokens or NFTs can be reclaimed by the project owner, preventing resource wastage. Distribution Flexibility: Project owners can pause and resume airdrops, offering greater control over the distribution process. Multi-Stage Airdrops: Supports staggered distributions, beneficial for complex tokenomics or tiered reward systems. All of Sorodrop’s software components will be open sourced and this will allow users to tailor their airdrop however they want. Application specific airdrops can be made possible with custom development on top of Sorodrop’s smart contracts.

There have been several attempts at airdrop tools on Stellar, but none have gained traction or are widely considered by projects in the Stellar ecosystem. Our airdrop project on Stellar stands out with several key features that will change this: We support airdrops with over a thousand recipients by implementing merkle calculation for greater gas efficiency. Project owners can customize airdrop terms, including start time, expiration time, name, and logo. Our platform allows multi-stage airdrops, enabling tiered structures within a single contract. Owners can pause and resume airdrops for enhanced security. We are open-source, providing users and project owners access to our tools and contracts for secure use. We also offer the capability to airdrop NFTs to large audiences.",,,,,https://www.loom.com/share/dd8fa363e8084969b217f2b7151b1f60?sid=bde11a68-a997-45f6-9e7c-1bd5a9d095fd,,,,,,,"Arda Nakisci, Hasan İrice",,,,,

Git is one of the most widely used VCS and while being by design decentralized, developers rely on very centralized synchronization systems such as GitHub.

This centralization raises serious concerns as any actor gaining access to these repositories can: change the history, update code, make releases, and even delete files. All while being hardly noticeable. As open source software is relied upon by all industries, it poses a real threat in terms of software supply chain security.

The core idea of this proposal is to bring Git hashes onto Stellar's blockchain to benefit from the traceability and accountability blockchain technology guarantees. The code itself is still versioned using Git and it is still hosted on the synchronization platform of choice, which does not interfere with maintainers' traditional workflows. This gives maintainers access to new ways of managing their project on-chain and at its core it provides a distributed way to prove the integrity of their project.

Our project will greatly benefit Stellar's ecosystem as open-source maintainers using our system will get to use Stellar and Soroban. This will in turn bring some of these maintainers to the Stellar ecosystem.

Version Control System (VCS), specifically using Git, is ubiquitous among software engineers. Git is by design decentralized, more so, the code history makes use of a Merkle tree: a given version, referred to as a commit, is given a hash and hashes are linked together to provide a history. Git is in essence a blockchain.

When working on a project using Git, everyone gets the complete history and people can push and pull code from one person to another. The resolution of differences between one's code to another can be challenging if many people work on the same code area.

In practice, a team of developers-maintainers need a more convenient way to synchronize their work. To address this problem, maintainers can use a central platform where they can synchronize their work. GitHub is the most used platform to share and collaborate on open-source projects. For many teams, the whole software development lifecycle happens there, from the inception of ideas to making a release of a new version.

This centralization brings a lot of challenges when it comes to securing the software supply chain. In past years, we have seen attacks on almost every, if not all, parts of this centralized structure. Maintainers are being compromised, they become rogue, through exploits on GitHub or in the continuous integration system the code is compromised, there are occurrences of release artifacts being compromised and GitHub is also deleting projects which they deemed (albeit enforced by local regulations) not suitable for their platforms.

To answer these concerns around software supply chain security, we propose to leverage the Stellar blockchain to store Git hashes. The following components are proposed: (i) a Soroban smart contract to register Git hashes on-chain; (ii) a dApp for maintainers to manage their projects and users to participate and monitor their dependencies; and (iii) tools to help maintainers deploy and use this system transparently.

The core of the proposal is a Soroban Smart Contract called: Soroban Versioning contract. This contract will set the foundation of what will be built to support maintainers with their projects.

The contract will hold project-specific metadata and a key pointing to the last code change hash. Updating the hash leaves a permanent record on-chain. These update events can be monitored to build an off-chain history and be further compared to the state on other platforms such as GitHub. We will build the necessary services to ingest these events. These services will play a pivotal role as sitting in between Soroban and our proposed dApp.

Strict access control is key to guarantee that only maintainers can update on-chain data. Soroban provides an elegant and robust solution with address signing. By storing a list of authorized maintainers on-chain, we are enabling projects to be more transparent as to who has specific rights.

As we have seen in past similar projects, the developer experience is paramount to get any traction and adoption. To that end, we will provide various pre-commit hooks to seamlessly fit most maintainers' workflow.

Last but not least, our codebase will not only be open-sourced, our development will also be open. We will ensure that we provide comprehensive documentation and that the code can be easily understood and audited. Maintainers will need guarantees that we are only doing what they explicitly want us to do with their credentials.",,,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning,,,,,,,Tupui,logomark_black.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/43/43/1752580800000/6cOpT092tAUaXzSIqoqv0w/5ae6m4asDzLYz2_m2S7OQXBXctPrFi7_PqsNFqtqBplyf6826HzehpVFnsOSmwkX-5Jxw48lISQIsxpDwjnAwdr1YZAFPGPcs4XqPK3SiULTgsp8-IofiwDqglZai_P4CIRxoqwhujpRJAAqCna2lvn4FBpQooxDBxRFtAd4ffk/cQiES8CF1p19QHexx2PTDGXy5Y-GJVKTItcFVA1FvGg),,,,

The Stellar Startup Camp is a program that provides the guidance and building blocks needed for startups looking to launch their projects on Stellar. Bigger ran the first Startup camp with 34 companies. For the first iteration of the Stellar Startup Camp, we developed the Startup Camp Gitbook and the Figma file, which is what founders use to turn their vision into a well-crafted application. The Figma file containing the design sprint has been thoroughly tested in beta with a select number of founders (previous to the Startup Camp), and we will continue to tailor it with each iteration. Important: The Stellar Development Foundation can use the resulting startup camp materials and knowledge independently of Bigger, meaning the SDF is not vendor-locked. Besides the direct value we bring to the community in the form of new projects and helping reviews be of higher quality, we are also able to provide value by gathering insights from seeing the entire funnel, from companies hearing about the Stellar funding opportunities (with little to no prior Stellar knowledge) until they apply to the SCF and how they receive and act on the feedback given by reviewers.

Key learnings:
The technical aspect of Stellar remains a challenge for newcomers. Here is where a dedicated team of mentors makes a difference. By clarifying concepts and ensuring the technical solutions make sense, companies gain clarity on leveraging the Stellar network and give reviewers confidence that the team knows what they are doing and is ready to build. Go-to-market strategy needs to be more prominent. There is a notorious shift in the reviewer’s preference for projects that bring (existing) users to the community. Some “unwritten” rules for projects need to be included in the SCF handbook and cascaded to the Startup Camp. For example, Anchors will not be funded without an existing attestation of reserves and active userbase. The Startup Camp was more intensive than anticipated. We should start earlier by giving people access to the basic Stellar resources and setting some expectations around what they should acquaint themselves with before starting. It needs to extend beyond the deadline to support people with resubmissions, where eligible.

Key metrics:
122 companies pre-registered. 34 companies selected. 29 companies finished the Startup Camp (~85% of participants). 26 companies submitted (~90% of those who finished). 7 companies funded (~27% of submitted). 10 participants gave us feedback (~30%); the average score was 4.9 out of 5.

What was our initial objective and how did we do? The objectives of our initial application were to turn the Startup camp process into a self-serve process that attracts fresh talent from diverse demographics more frequently and sets them up for success. Self-serve process: The first iteration of Startup Camp 2.0 set the baseline for where we stand today. The two most highlighted aspects of the Startup Camp were the clarity we brought participants on how to submit a project to the Stellar Community Fund (self-serve) and the technical support we offered throughout the process (still manual). Fresh talent: 122 participants. Diverse demographics: We selected teams from South and North America, Africa, Europe, Oceania (AU & NZ) and Asia. More frequently: This startup camp will run in July (the last one was in April), which is already 1 month sooner than the previous version. We aim to keep streamlining this process so it can run every month. That sets participants up for success: 90% of participants presented their project to the SCF, 73% asked to resubmit, and 27% funded projects. The biggest challenge was that people weren’t sure who would build the solution.

To wrap up, some unfiltered feedback:
""I am surprised by the careful thought you guys have been giving during this entire time. We can see that every step was considered and we are doing our best to learn the tools, through the daily meetings and mentors. I will overshare a little here: I was recently fired from a company that was very hard to work with, had many many problems and I felt just a number there. And I fall here, in the SCF Camp with all this love, respect, and kindness to each other. Just makes me try even harder because that is the life I want. Those are the people I want to be next to. Thank you guys!"" ""Invaluable feedback and insights from every team member!"" ""Figma file could have been more defined and ready to be used as a first time user. But loved the experience.""",,,https://stellar-startup-camp.biggertech.co/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_C1-tBpLAI,,,,,,,Fabricio Leonardo Sodano Pascazi,,,,,

With space for 15 talented builders, this will be the second iteration of the BAF x Stellar Builder House. Whereas the need for additional events that engage technical talent has been identified; whereas the demand for student sponsorship to attend a builders' retreat has only increased since the completion of the BAF x Stellar Builder House; whereas high-performing students from various regions of North America have been identified as ideal candidates for the builder house, and spaces are available for first-time builders to begin their web3 foundations by building on Stellar. There is a noted lack of engagement from the academic field during the summer with web3 initiatives, and the builders' retreat caters to students with a strong desire to build for philanthropic purposes while strengthening their skillset. Workshops will be conducted each day of the retreat, and all projects are to be built on Soroban/Stellar's platform, with final presentations being done on the last day of the retreat. The theme of the retreat will be ""empowerment"", focusing on financial justice in developing regions through the power of decentralization.

Open Builders' Day: This will take place at a venue in SF during the retreat, and will serve as a demo day for the residents of the retreat and a chance for others to showcase their Soroban-built projects with the greater community. Here, the BAF team and community of Stellar enthusiasts will come together to exchange knowledge and know-how surrounding Stellar and its capabilities. Food will be served, and this event will highlight the work put in by builders at the retreat, with the eventual goal of each project being pursued further beyond the conclusion of the retreat. With builders sharing their stories and projects, the open builders' day aims to allow the creativity and passion of those in the Stellar ecosystem to flourish.

Soroban Saturdays (Educational/Content for University Series): A content initiative with frequent posts weekly featuring a mix of both technical and non-technical use cases for Stellar technology, meant to inform and educate members of the academic community who possess varying levels of blockchain proficiency. This will be an open-source series that allows for all to benefit from technical content, tutorials, and articles that can be understood by someone with limited or advanced proficiency of the web3 space. This initiative will solve the learning curve issue that many have when entering the blockchain ecosystem, and serve as a guide for those wanting to build out full projects on Stellar. The BAF team and former participants of the builder house have achieved a proficiency in Soroban, and with assistance from the SDF developer team, educational content will be distributed to a number of students and university blockchain organizations -- who will conclude the Soroban Saturdays program with a full plan for an event to be hosted on their university campus, thus expanding the reach Stellar has in the academic world, and BAF will take care of logistics and event planning with each university to ensure success of events.",,,blockchainacceleration.org,,Bbuilder house recap we conducted at Consensus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV-yNV_Nf4w,,,,,,,"iski02, Isabelle Ki",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/thebafnetwork/,https://twitter.com/TheBAFNetwork,,

Typically, once funds are raised, they transition off-chain, leading to a subsequent lack of transparency. This opacity can shy away investors, limit access to capital and availability of capital.

Our project, the ClickPesa Debt Fund, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) debt fund that leverages the Stellar Network and Soroban smart contracts to provide end-to-end traceability in the lending process. The intentions are to bring enhanced transparency to DeFi lending, making each step in the lending chain—from disbursement to repayment—fully verifiable and transparent. The ClickPesa Debt Fund introduces a solution that maintains traceability entirely on-chain, ensuring that every transaction is recorded and accessible, by leveraging our licensed payment gateway ClickPesa, which is already integrated with Stellar and providing a wallet to each MFI. This approach not only increases confidence among investors by providing clear visibility into the flow of funds but also enhances the ability of MFIs and SMEs to secure necessary financing under fair conditions.

Target Audience and Their Benefits:

Lenders benefit from increased transparency, which reduces risk and provides clearer insight into how their funds are being utilized.

MFIs gain better access to funds through a transparent platform, enabling them to expand their operations and support more SMEs efficiently.

SMEs benefit from more readily available funding opportunities, facilitating growth and operational stability.

How does it work and how does it use Stellar and Soroban:

ClickPesa utilizes the Stellar Network for its robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure, which is ideal for handling cost-efficient and reliable transactions. On top of this, we employ Soroban smart contracts with the ClickPesa Debt Fund to automate and secure the lending process:

Disbursement and Collection Visibility: Smart contracts track and verify the actual flow of funds to and from MFIs, ensuring all parties adhere to agreed terms.

Fee Transparency: All fees charged during the lending process are recorded and made visible through the blockchain, preventing hidden charges and fostering trust.

Automated Execution: Our platform automates transactions such as fund disbursements and repayments based on predefined criteria or milestones. For example, when a payment is made, the smart contract automatically executes the necessary actions, such as refunding money back to the appropriate entity.",,,https://clickpesadebtfund.com,,https://youtu.be/pMa1aHESACQ,,,,,,,"Rick Groothuizen, rlematz ",,,,,

It is powered by a PoS blockchain infrastructure. The product includes the development of a secure and cost-effective EVM-Soroban stablecoin bridge with low latency.

Interoperability has long been a challenge addressed by blockchain developers. Many interoperability technologies focus on moving assets between siloed chains, but this raises concerns about a single point of failure. To address this issue, oracle protocols like Chainlink have developed inter-chain messaging protocols that relay data between siloed chains. However, most of these oracles, like Chainlink, do not support non-EVM blockchains.

ZKLiquid proposes an EVM-Soroban bridge for stablecoins. This solution relies on ZKLiquid's interoperability messaging protocol, a decentralized network that uses a PoS consensus mechanism to validate and synchronize data between EVM chains and Soroban.

Bridging liquidity between EVM chains and Soroban in a secure and efficient manner is crucial. This capability will enable users to freely transfer assets back and forth. Consequently, many crypto enthusiasts who have long relied on EVM chains for interoperability will now have the opportunity to utilize dApps and hold assets on the Soroban blockchain. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in the number of users and the on-chain TVL of Soroban.",,,https://app.zkliquid.io,https://app.zkliquid.io/swap,https://app.zkliquid.io/swap,,,,,,,Adedotun Akintayo,,,https://x.com/LiquidsFi,,
