Using Arbitrum - Community Activities\n\n2. Building on Arbitrum - Developer Activities\n\n3. Bridging in and out of the Arbitrum Network\n\n4. dApp ideas that support Arbitrum Network\n\n\nMy work with my Not-for-profit's last Cipher Session Started in October and we had 20 new developers signed up to take our free Solidity course.\n\nSee our Progress Report here:\nhttps://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1707740083451723815?s=20\n\n\nThese programs cover a wide range of topics, including:\n\n1.

creation, and public speaking, I have onboarded over **1000** individuals into Web3, reached an audience of **30,000+** across platforms, helped **50+** mentees secure jobs, grants, and internships, and collaborated with leading Web3 communities to expand education and opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Grant Matters**\n\nWith the Gitcoin **“Web3 for Universities”** grant, I will:\n\n- Expand mentorship initiatives within 0xShip, onboarding more young African talents.\n\n- Create more in-depth educational content (videos, courses, and training programs).\n\n- Support Web3 student developers with resources and tools.\n\n- Increase accessibility to blockchain knowledge for underrepresented communities.\n\n**Support this initiative and help us scale Web3

These sessions have reached a cumulative audience of over 3000 listeners, providing accessible learning for both tech and non-tech participants.\n\n## Speaking Engagement:\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1888300288525709781\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1817208362188333335\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1730303190166315127\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1882430517657968744\n\n🔗 https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1890349717785092302\n🔗 https://x.com/SCAportharcourt/status/1836817357575967098\n🔗 https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1765654426822246485 \n🔗 https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1730277517053841504 \n\n## Event Hosting & Collaboration\nI’ve served as both host and co-host for various virtual and physical Web3 events, fostering safe learning spaces for beginners and intermediate participants:\n\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1895483669911118117\n🔗 https://x.com/borderlessdev/status/1895409799937863949\n🔗 https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1890655396928303509\n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1852615020888113527 \n🔗 https://x.com/ib_soll/status/1823437633462370642\n🔗 https://x.com/_karlagod/status/1856111047817736251\n🔗 https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1852310985924550745\n\n## Web3 Event Sponsorship:\nI’ve also supported other community-led events as a sponsor, ensuring more learning opportunities for Web3 beginners:\n\n🔗 https://x.com/blockchainNAU/status/1865345994784661725 \n🔗 https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1849018474279952487\n🔗 https://x.com/BR_Conference_/status/1821436490091512028 \n\n\n# 2.

This experience demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate complex Web3 concepts to a diverse audience and drive active participation in decentralized funding initiatives.\n    * Relevant link: [https://x.com/Callum_Trace/status/1858051722578444721](https://x.com/Callum_Trace/status/1858051722578444721) (A tweet showing my work at the gitcoin booth)\n* **Web3 Education and Testnet Onboarding (University Setting):**\n    * Within my university environment, I have actively onboarded fellow students to the Web3 ecosystem by demystifying key concepts like testnets and protocol interaction. Through clear and concise explanations, I have empowered students to engage with various testnet protocols, fostering a practical understanding of decentralized technologies. This initiative has helped to build foundational knowledge and practical skills among my peers, encouraging further exploration of the Web3 space.\n\n**Community Engagements:**\n\n* My dedication to fostering Web3 communities is evident through my active participation in the Borderless Tech Club at UNN, where I consistently attend and engage in most of the events that have been held.\n* Furthermore, I serve as a moderator for the Shot Caller Alpha community, playing a crucial role in providing comprehensive orientation and onboarding for newcomers to the Web3 space. This involves guiding individuals through the complexities of the ecosystem, ensuring they have the necessary knowledge and resources to participate effectively.\n* Relevant links:\n    * [https://x.com/Borderlessunn/status/1781320793793634744](https://x.com/Borderlessunn/status/1781320793793634744) (One of the earliest borderless tech events I attended)\n\n**Funding Goals and How the Funds Will Be Used:**\n\nFunding will significantly amplify my ability to teach Web3 education in Nigerian universities by enabling the creation of easy-to-understand learning materials, expansion of hands-on onboarding initiatives, and the fostering of thriving campus-based Web3 communities. This will include organizing regional events to reach more ears, ultimately empowering the next generation of Nigerian Web3 contributors and accelerating the adoption of decentralized technologies within the Nigeria.","logoImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"Callum_Trace"},"metadataCid":"bafkreido535ux6eruezwa5hy23q4rr6a3rj3wce3iddozw5kqnuew2kgkm","timestamp":"2025-03-24T16:18:13+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xE764c305e6aB8fA62Ed3A5b0f4D4d0e5e5de2a1b","createdAtBlock":31031684}],"projectId":"0x8a448efd1a22550feabab5741a051605c92c324330b88e43d379c1672ca53ca7","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"27","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-24T16:58:08.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31032163"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2025-03-26T12:56:49.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31093051"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":31627491,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-24T16:58:08+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":57.30621,"totalDonationsCount":30,"uniqueDonorsCount":30},{"anchorAddress":"0x0cDA122a4417208c069Eb2d01A703b385bB3f0b3","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31252808,"createdByAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","distributionTransaction":"0xe04772e48289f3aeeedb204ae892f38a0e038476cbfed8db814baeac7f83a9f8","donations":[{"amount":3310000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":993528527431392900,"amountInUsd":0.99314,"id":"0x683e73a19849a8d8faec5ae052457a54e64cd05457ac1a0aac27c2a0fafb5198","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0x707E2302149294584f570d53C666d3008d39d24e","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-03T21:45:51+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x63ee8fbf590b7fb5794455c6b7c1175436d5f798f74ccb502ae64fd1b79f0cdd"},{"amount":100000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":30121363836121450,"amountInUsd":0.03011,"id":"0x23f2aadcf916176c35eb68b175702892f41e7d411e2f2cdf0efe377afb18bf22","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0x707E2302149294584f570d53C666d3008d39d24e","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-04T17:29:09+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x22e2590111c9b45d46f32698be71c31d35195fc5c6352f9e120694a87267a714"},{"amount":6500000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":2009434760555493600,"amountInUsd":2.01042,"id":"0xd364726a8ac73c9134e5a3604597587b83ac38bbcc4b27addd53772fdf0f351f","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0x9DCbA70B2dfe5807e2A847E065EBb666791F8b8A","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-05T08:26:33+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x6fd1151094b4cebfe90a2363962f7bbe1b8e1a346f8198c639d334b7212fb732"},{"amount":20000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":6032552135192643000,"amountInUsd":6.02905,"id":"0x7db15dd6b554dad6bb6225a8c82223e0e20049f9a4deb2220b2fe3234f8e1d82","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0x4496b5b8BC89B513E28af5E85EB24b9F666Bdc9f","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-06T09:42:32+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0xfaaf934e74b1704277151f1dacd62fa0f35f9519fcbb0cda5e303a4ddd069e44"},{"amount":3700000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":1013300606648287700,"amountInUsd":1.01402,"id":"0x9d59c8f30eaae1a8b9d5925ccef124bee130f4512980f1a5eee12e56f71a04c4","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0xCd4A5d813ba3c88b79450EC632e5EcA0a92Fd6B9","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-07T21:43:09+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x743ac7c93a44c439a7a0d8eda5d000d486ef06121d6b2e4882e8a725b29db54a"},{"amount":3500000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":970585234078385200,"amountInUsd":0.9701,"id":"0x005e69f543450387597e69d02e7af7c72a958a5b5927b6e743fd4765f5ac128c","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB70368A09BE","donorAddress":"0x65c936FBF0150C75d69fff6D9270b8F1b57fC21f","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-08T12:50:10+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0xeecd1277590b7b5be82f0aa80c6ee176775c73b19d2593d2b2539293ff396c6b"},{"amount":10000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":2710604044977895000,"amountInUsd":2.71508,"id":"0xf9a657bec8e749f9298f5520940b1a3b36b29ecbf93d8029aca51b76b54b684a","projectId":"0xed8cce769d2ac0025884a770bac4b0a187b88e51cf22889d916f9e5b1be162f1","recipientAddress":"0x5ee40B027C0d1C163274ab1f1D96dB

Since joining the Borderless Web3 Community in November 2023, I’ve dedicated myself to bridging the gap between African university students and the Web3 ecosystem. As a student myself, I understand the challenges my peers face in accessing Web3 education, especially for non-technical students. I combine my creative talents with my commitment to education to make Web3 accessible, engaging, and inclusive for university communities.\n\nWhat I’m About: My work focuses on simplifying complex Web3 concepts, building supportive communities, and creating opportunities for students to explore Web3 careers. Over the past 16 months, I’ve impacted students from Rivers State University, Ignatius Ajuru University UNIPORT, and NIIT by onboarding 190-230 students into Web3 through events, educational content, and community-building. \n\nI’ve engaged 1,880+ students at events like Borderless 3.0, reached 1,650+ users through educational threads on X, grown my Web3 Clan WhatsApp community to 160+ members, and connected 50-70 students to Web3 job opportunities.\n\nMy approach is inclusive - I use music, storytelling, and community engagement to make Web3 approachable for students from diverse academic backgrounds, ensuring no one is left behind in the Web3 revolution . \n\nWhat Impact I Aim to Achieve:\nMy goal is to onboard 1,000 African university students into Web3 over the next two years, creating a network of Web3-educated youth who can navigate this complex world of Web3\n\nTo achieve this, I plan to:  Perform at Web3 events in Port Harcourt: I aim to perform at major Web3 event in Port Harcourt, to draw university students into Web3 education. Building on my success at Borderless 3.0, where my performance engaged 1,880+ attendees and led to 20-30 students being onboarded, I’ll use music to create an inclusive atmosphere at events like the upcoming Borderless 4.0 event and future Borderless gatherings.\n\nBy performing at 5-7 events annually, I estimate engaging 3,000-5,000 university students over the next two years, onboarding 300-500 through event workshops and follow-up activities (e.g., joining Borderless community and participating in cipher sessions).

Since joining the Borderless Web3 Community in November 2023, I’ve dedicated myself to bridging the gap between African university students and the Web3 ecosystem. As a student myself, I understand the challenges my peers face in accessing Web3 education, especially for non-technical students. I combine my creative talents with my commitment to education to make Web3 accessible, engaging, and inclusive for university communities.\n\nWhat I’m About: My work focuses on simplifying complex Web3 concepts, building supportive communities, and creating opportunities for students to explore Web3 careers. Over the past 16 months, I’ve impacted students from Rivers State University, Ignatius Ajuru University UNIPORT, and NIIT by onboarding 190-230 students into Web3 through events, educational content, and community-building. \n\nI’ve engaged 1,880+ students at events like Borderless 3.0, reached 1,650+ users through educational threads on X, grown my Web3 Clan WhatsApp community to 160+ members, and connected 50-70 students to Web3 job opportunities.\n\nMy approach is inclusive - I use music, storytelling, and community engagement to make Web3 approachable for students from diverse academic backgrounds, ensuring no one is left behind in the Web3 revolution . \n\nWhat Impact I Aim to Achieve:\nMy goal is to onboard 1,000 African university students into Web3 over the next two years, creating a network of Web3-educated youth who can navigate this complex world of Web3\n\nTo achieve this, I plan to:  Perform at Web3 events in Port Harcourt: I aim to perform at major Web3 event in Port Harcourt, to draw university students into Web3 education. Building on my success at Borderless 3.0, where my performance engaged 1,880+ attendees and led to 20-30 students being onboarded, I’ll use music to create an inclusive atmosphere at events like the upcoming Borderless 4.0 event and future Borderless gatherings.\n\nBy performing at 5-7 events annually, I estimate engaging 3,000-5,000 university students over the next two years, onboarding 300-500 through event workshops and follow-up activities (e.g., joining Borderless community and participating in cipher sessions). This will amplify Web3 education in universities across Port Harcourt, fostering a culture of blockchain participation. \n\nScale Web3 Education Through Content: By enhancing my content creation, I plan to reach 500+ university students per video through talking head videos  on X, onboarding 150-225 more students in the next 6 months.  \n\nGrow University Communities: I’ll expand my Web3 Clan community by 300+ university student members over the next year, providing resources, bounty opportunities, and event updates to onboard 500+ students by 2026.

Unlike other onboarding tools, we don’t just introduce users to wallets and blockchains—we provide a measurable, on-chain record of their learning journey. This is what sets us apart:\n\n1. Verifiable Onboarding with On-Chain Attestations\n\nMost competitors offer guides and tutorials but lack a way to verify whether a user actually completed onboarding.\n\nByteonchain.xyz tracks onboarding progress and issues on-chain attestations, ensuring users complete the necessary steps before moving forward.\n\n2. Community-Driven Gas Fee Support\n\nTraditional onboarding methods require users to self-fund their first blockchain transaction, which can be a barrier.\n\nWe enable communities to sponsor gas fees ($0.20 - $1) to help users complete their first transaction.\n\n3. Integration with Web3 Events, DAOs, and Hackathons\n\nMany onboarding platforms focus on static courses without integration into real Web3 experiences.\n\nByteonchain.xyz is built for live events, allowing hackathons, DAOs, and Web3 conferences to track who has successfully onboarded.\n\n4. Simplified, Gamified Learning Process\n\nUnlike complex courses that overwhelm beginners, our approach uses:\n\nStep-by-step wallet and blockchain setup\n\nCommunity quizzes to reinforce learning\n\nOn-chain certifications to prove completion\n\n5. On-Chain Certifications for Courses\n\nMany Web3 courses and learning platforms don’t provide blockchain-based proof of completion.\n\nWith Byteonchain.xyz, users can claim certifications as on-chain attestations by purchasing a $1 token to cover gas fees, making their achievements verifiable across Web3 platforms.\n\n6. Public Goods & Open-Source Focus\n\nWhile competitors often charge high fees for onboarding or certifications, we align with Public Goods principles.\n\nOur focus is on growing Web3 participation and supporting open-source contributors, ensuring long-term ecosystem sustainability.\n\n\n## Who can use byteonchain.xyz\n\n1. Web3 Newcomers & Enthusiasts\n\n- Individuals looking to understand blockchain, wallets, and smart contract interactions.\n- Crypto-curious users who need structured onboarding rather than fragmented, complex guides.\n\n2.

Simplified, Gamified Learning Process\n\nUnlike complex courses that overwhelm beginners, our approach uses:\n\nStep-by-step wallet and blockchain setup\n\nCommunity quizzes to reinforce learning\n\nOn-chain certifications to prove completion\n\n5. On-Chain Certifications for Courses\n\nMany Web3 courses and learning platforms don’t provide blockchain-based proof of completion.\n\nWith Byteonchain.xyz, users can claim certifications as on-chain attestations by purchasing a $1 token to cover gas fees, making their achievements verifiable across Web3 platforms.\n\n6. Public Goods & Open-Source Focus\n\nWhile competitors often charge high fees for onboarding or certifications, we align with Public Goods principles.\n\nOur focus is on growing Web3 participation and supporting open-source contributors, ensuring long-term ecosystem sustainability.\n\n\n## Who can use byteonchain.xyz\n\n1. Web3 Newcomers & Enthusiasts\n\n- Individuals looking to understand blockchain, wallets, and smart contract interactions.\n- Crypto-curious users who need structured onboarding rather than fragmented, complex guides.\n\n2. University Students & Developers Transitioning to Web3\n\n- Students and developers eager to **learn blockchain development, DeFi, and smart contracts**.\n- Those transitioning from Web2 to Web3, requiring **hands-on learning and verifiable attestations**.\n\n3. Web3 Event Organizers & Hackathon Hosts\n\n- Web3 conferences, DAOs, and hackathons that want seamless onboarding experiences for their participants.\n- Hosts looking for a structured way to track onboarding completion and issue on-chain credentials.\n\n4. DAOs, Communities & Public Goods Projects\n\n- Blockchain communities that want a standardized, measurable onboarding process for new members.\n- DAOs and Web3 organizations looking to issue decentralized credentials to contributors and learners.\n\n5. Web3 Education Platforms & Content Creators\n\n- Online courses, bootcamps, and educators who want on-chain certifications for their students.\n- YouTubers, bloggers, and influencers promoting Web3 adoption and seeking tools to verify learning outcomes.\n\n6. Blockchain Networks & Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\n- Protocols and L2 ecosystems aiming to increase adoption by simplifying onboarding.\n- Foundations and ecosystem grants looking for scalable, impactful education tools.\n\n\n## PROGRESS REPORT AND PoWs\n\n# Deployed on 4 chains\nBase: https://base.easscan.org/attestation/view/0xb57441fb4bf06defef1ab2a2314cfcf251bd2f12319b60ef0cd77147cdd433de\n\nOptimism: https://optimism.easscan.org/attestation/view/0x73ba82184334a09bb7da00101ce1bf61ad9fb0446c6f9f11184e3a43d4a9dfc6\n\nCelo: https://celo.easscan.org/attestation/view/0xcc8032e94ce8d79324d8c04c4d964f0b603020f034e91393c2b5eee8f342f6e1\n\nArbitrum: https://arbitrum.easscan.org/attestation/view/0x5de6b2f487a6940d9c92106398793fd1552c1e7432dbc5b18ba59b6488efed15\n\nConnect your wallet and see the schemas\nhttps://byteonchain.xyz/schema\n\n87 Persons Onboarded through a web3 course\n\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe9a059a2f6cf3a119b0f8c1d5dc022711a447c7fbb94baf6ce670ca2e6faeaeb\n\n145 Persons Onboarded through web3 events\n\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xadc627b3baae8680c1e7d1f080ea5e50738e7efcc93e95a35269e6841116fffe\n\nGitHub Repo\nhttps://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/byteonchain\n\nAdmin Panel ready\nhttps://byteonchainadmin.vercel.app/#ui-basic\n\n[![Screenshot-2025-03-18-212603.png](https://i.postimg.cc/DyH7thk6/Screenshot-2025-03-18-212603.png)](https://postimg.cc/ykhqZwN3)\n\n\nNEWBIE USER FEEDBACK\nClick here to watch feedback videos from 3 complete beginners who had never attended a web3 event before.

INTRODUCTION\nBorderless Unizik is a Borderless Tech club established in Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra, with a mission to empower students with knowledge and practical skills in Tech and Web3. Since its inception in 2023, we have hosted three physical meetups and several online sessions to educate students on blockchain technology, tech, and how to build Web3 projects. We have collaborated with notable blockchain and Web3 communities in Anambra, such as the Anambra Web3 Conference, Unizik Blockchain Lab, Bitcoin on Campus Meetup, Suioncampus Meetup, Creatiz, Women in Defi Anambra chapter, Apex Tech Hub and Anambra Techies. Our efforts have resulted in over ten students successfully graduating from the Borderless Cirpher program, where they acquired skills in Solidity, UI/UX design, data analysis, and web development.\nTo further our impact, we propose the establishment of a Tech Hub within Nnamdi Azikiwe University to serve as a central learning space for students interested in tech and blockchain.\n\n2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES:\n\nEstablish a Tech Hub within Nnamdi Azikiwe University, providing students with a physical space for hands-on learning, collaboration, and mentorship in tech and Web3.\nEnhance Blockchain and Tech Education by hosting regular workshops, hackathons, and training sessions.\nIncrease Community Engagement by expanding partnerships with local and global blockchain/Web3 communities.\nBridge the Knowledge Gap by offering structured programs in Solidity, UI/UX design, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other tech-related fields.\nFoster Innovation and Startups by supporting student-led Web3 and tech projects through mentorship and incubation.\n\n3. PROJECT SCOPE & IMPLEMENTATION:\nPhase 1: Securing a Space for the Tech Hub\nPartner with the university administration to allocate a dedicated space for the hub. Equip the hub with computers, internet access, and learning materials.\nDesign an operational structure, including scheduled training programs.\n\nPhase 2: Training & Community Building\nOrganize weekly training sessions on blockchain development, smart contracts, and Web3 security.\nInvite industry experts for mentorship and guest lectures.

INTRODUCTION\nBorderless Unizik is a Borderless Tech club established in Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra, with a mission to empower students with knowledge and practical skills in Tech and Web3. Since its inception in 2023, we have hosted three physical meetups and several online sessions to educate students on blockchain technology, tech, and how to build Web3 projects. We have collaborated with notable blockchain and Web3 communities in Anambra, such as the Anambra Web3 Conference, Unizik Blockchain Lab, Bitcoin on Campus Meetup, Suioncampus Meetup, Creatiz, Women in Defi Anambra chapter, Apex Tech Hub and Anambra Techies. Our efforts have resulted in over ten students successfully graduating from the Borderless Cirpher program, where they acquired skills in Solidity, UI/UX design, data analysis, and web development.\nTo further our impact, we propose the establishment of a Tech Hub within Nnamdi Azikiwe University to serve as a central learning space for students interested in tech and blockchain.\n\n2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES:\n\nEstablish a Tech Hub within Nnamdi Azikiwe University, providing students with a physical space for hands-on learning, collaboration, and mentorship in tech and Web3.\nEnhance Blockchain and Tech Education by hosting regular workshops, hackathons, and training sessions.\nIncrease Community Engagement by expanding partnerships with local and global blockchain/Web3 communities.\nBridge the Knowledge Gap by offering structured programs in Solidity, UI/UX design, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other tech-related fields.\nFoster Innovation and Startups by supporting student-led Web3 and tech projects through mentorship and incubation.\n\n3. PROJECT SCOPE & IMPLEMENTATION:\nPhase 1: Securing a Space for the Tech Hub\nPartner with the university administration to allocate a dedicated space for the hub. Equip the hub with computers, internet access, and learning materials.\nDesign an operational structure, including scheduled training programs.\n\nPhase 2: Training & Community Building\nOrganize weekly training sessions on blockchain development, smart contracts, and Web3 security.\nInvite industry experts for mentorship and guest lectures. Host bi-monthly hackathons and bootcamps to encourage project development.\n\nPhase 3: Expanding Impact & Sustainability\nStrengthen collaborations with existing tech and blockchain communities. Launch a student-led project incubation program within the hub. Develop a system for membership and alumni engagement.\n\n4.

I was onboarded into Web3 in the Borderless Web3 Community. Since then, I have been an active Web3: Educator, Content Creator, Social Media Manager, and a Web3 Pressman.\n\nI am proposing the ‘TheNewbiesCorner (TNC)’ project, a Web3/Tech educational project designed to help students seamlessly transition into Tech and Web3. It simplifies complex Web3 concepts, breaking them down like explaining to a baby. Through a structured website, it provides free educational videos, explainers, workbooks, and eBooks. NewbiesCorner also supports Web2 professionals in integrating Web3 into their fields or transitioning to Web3.

I was onboarded into Web3 in the Borderless Web3 Community. Since then, I have been an active Web3: Educator, Content Creator, Social Media Manager, and a Web3 Pressman.\n\nI present the ‘TheNewbiesCorner (TNC)’ project, a Web3/Tech educational project designed to help students seamlessly transition into Tech and Web3. It simplifies complex Web3 concepts, breaking them down like explaining to a baby. Through a structured website, it provides free educational videos, explainers, workbooks, and eBooks. NewbiesCorner also supports Web2 professionals in integrating Web3 into their fields or transitioning to Web3.

I'll go through these department heads, visit at least 10 departments across 4 universities, and talk to them about the conference. Virtual sensitization will be done across these departments, where the link for registration will be sent to their department groups/forums. From there, I'll keep them engaged through emails as they sign up for the conference.\n\nIt is important to note that I have prior experience in marketing through emails, content, and other forms, as I was the head of the newsletter team and a part of the content, social media, and planning teams for Borderless 3.0. I played a vital part in Borderless 3.0's success. \n\nAnd, of course, I won't be doing this alone.\n\nI have close ties with the chairman of the Borderless 3.0 event, and I'll be working closely with him to ensure everything is done right. I already have a list of speakers on paper (I reached out to one, and he accepted to come speak at the conference when it's time)—speakers with vast experience across the Web3 space.\n\nThe idea is: Web3 for everyone—devs, content creators, and artists. Web3 is more than trading and doing airdrops, and this conference will help educate the attendees on this truth, demystify some of its complex concepts, and onboard some really exciting and talented young people into Web3.\n\n\nFrom breaking down Web3 concepts to designing viral onboarding experiences, I’m fully committed to pushing Web3 adoption forward. 🚀","hidden":false,"question":"Give a summary of your project or your work as an individual, include impact measurement reports (Qualitative & Quantitative).","questionId":2},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"N/A","hidden":true,"question":"If you are a developer applying with your project, please state the B<>rder/ess Cipher Session you attended, the course and your full name.

Here is a little more about me.\nI am one of the pioneers of b<>rder/ess tech club here in Nsukka and I was part of the team that successfully planned the b<>rderless 2.0 event which was held as a watch party here in Nsukka. There was a tour round the school for the event from which we successfully onboarded a couple of students who eventually made up the BTC UNN community when we started.\n Attached here is a link to the post made after the watch party.\n https://x.com/Borderlessunn/status/1727298940364595440\nI have successfully managed the official twitter account of b<>der/ess tech club UNN for more than a year now, that is since the day it was created.

It provides **pre-built, customizable components** that streamline the development process, enabling developers to focus on **core functionality** rather than spending excessive time on UI/UX design.  \n\n **Web3 Components**\nBetaUI simplifies Web3 integration with ready-to-use components, including:  \n **NFT Cards** – UI elements for displaying NFTs.  \n **Wallet Connection Modal** – A seamless interface for connecting crypto wallets.  \n **Successful Transaction Modal** – A notification system that confirms blockchain transactions.  \n **Token Swap Interface** – A component that simplifies token swapping in decentralized applications (dApps).  etc\n\n\n\n **Web2 Components**  \n\nFor traditional web applications, BetaUI also offers:  \n **Customizable Toast Alerts** – User-friendly notifications that enhance UX.  \n **Other essential UI elements** – Making frontend development faster and more efficient.  \n\n**Impact of BetaUI** \n\nThe primary goal of BetaUI is to **increase development speed and efficiency** by offering pre-built, highly customizable UI components. Here's how it achieves this:  \n\n✅ **Reducing Development Time**  \nEliminates the need for developers to build UI components from scratch, allowing them to focus on **functionality rather than styling and layout**.  \nThe **modular nature** of BetaUI enables quick integration, making it ideal for **rapid prototyping** and production-ready applications.  \n\n🌐 **Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3 UI Design**  \nMost UI libraries focus **only** on Web2 interfaces, forcing dApp developers to create Web3 components manually.  \n BetaUI simplifies Web3 integration with **ready-made components** for NFTs, token swaps, wallet connections, and transaction confirmations  etc.\n\n🎨 **Enhancing User Experience (UX) for Developers and End Users**  \nDevelopers benefit from **pre-optimized, responsive, and accessible** UI components.  \nEnd users enjoy **sleek, intuitive, and well-designed interfaces** that improve engagement and usability.  \n\n🚀 **Encouraging Adoption

decentralized applications (dApps)** across industries.  \n\n **💡 Open-Source and Developer-Friendly**  \nBetaUI is an **open-source, community-driven** project, allowing developers to **contribute, customize, and extend** its functionality.  \n\n🔗 **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/brightphi210/brightui](https://github.com/brightphi210/brightui)  \n\n💬 **Community Link**:

– A Modular & Sleek UI Library  \n\nWhat is BetaUI?\n\nBetaUI is a **modular and sleek UI library** designed to help developers build applications and websites without worrying about UI design. It provides **pre-built, customizable components** that streamline the development process, enabling developers to focus on **core functionality** rather than spending excessive time on UI/UX design.  \n\n **Web3 Components**\nBetaUI simplifies Web3 integration with ready-to-use components, including:  \n **NFT Cards** – UI elements for displaying NFTs.  \n **Wallet Connection Modal** – A seamless interface for connecting crypto wallets.  \n **Successful Transaction Modal** – A notification system that confirms blockchain transactions.  \n **Token Swap Interface** – A component that simplifies token swapping in decentralized applications (dApps).  etc\n\n\n\n **Web2 Components**  \n\nFor traditional web applications, BetaUI also offers:  \n **Customizable Toast Alerts** – User-friendly notifications that enhance UX.  \n **Other essential UI elements** – Making frontend development faster and more efficient.  \n\n**Impact of BetaUI** \n\nThe primary goal of BetaUI is to **increase development speed and efficiency** by offering pre-built, highly customizable UI components. Here's how it achieves this:  \n\n✅ **Reducing Development Time**  \nEliminates the need for developers to build UI components from scratch, allowing them to focus on **functionality rather than styling and layout**.  \nThe **modular nature** of BetaUI enables quick integration, making it ideal for **rapid prototyping** and production-ready applications.  \n\n🌐 **Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3 UI Design**  \nMost UI libraries focus **only** on Web2 interfaces, forcing dApp developers to create Web3 components manually.  \n BetaUI simplifies Web3 integration with **ready-made components** for NFTs, token swaps, wallet connections, and transaction confirmations  etc.\n\n🎨 **Enhancing User Experience (UX) for Developers and End Users**  \nDevelopers benefit from **pre-optimized, responsive, and accessible** UI components.  \nEnd users enjoy **sleek, intuitive, and well-designed interfaces** that improve engagement and usability.  \n\n🚀 **Encouraging Adoption of Blockchain-Based Applications**  \nBy making Web3 UI integration easier, BetaUI **lowers the entry barrier** for blockchain-based projects.  \nThis contributes to a **wider adoption of decentralized applications (dApps)** across industries.  \n\n **💡 Open-Source and Developer-Friendly**  \nBetaUI is an **open-source, community-driven** project, allowing developers to **contribute, customize, and extend** its functionality.  \n\n🔗 **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/brightphi210/brightui](https://github.com/brightphi210/brightui)  \n\n💬 **Community Link**: [https://t.me/+i9Xwns8c9qlkYTI0](https://t.me/+i9Xwns8c9qlkYTI0)  \n\n **📊 Achievements** \nSo far, BetaUI has achieved **800+ downloads**, reflecting its growing adoption among developers.  \n\n🔗 **Website**: [https://betaui.vercel.app/](https://betaui.vercel.app/)  \n\n📖 **Documentation**: [https://betauidocs.vercel.app/docs/Beginning/intro](https://betauidocs.vercel.app/docs/Beginning/intro)","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"BetaUI","projectTwitter":"chibuzorphilip7"},"metadataCid":"bafkreicgj4afqogdosppz3lzwmgahlz5nm64f3qek2n2saoad6hp2ip6hm","timestamp":"2025-03-21T18:14:00+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x22d2D2a9f3cF1aDcF6e69ea0460406E0B4066405","createdAtBlock":30981237}],"projectId":"0x692fbb6b2d3b5469b23f4d87c0d9d62e56e339214a682375902b1cdbf4c787b8","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":2}},"roundId":"27","status":"APPROVED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-22T15:37:13.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"30996635"},{"status":"APPROVED","updatedAt":"2025-03-23T21:21:55.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31018050"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":31627491,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-22T15:37:13+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":27.90853,"totalDonationsCount":21,"uniqueDonorsCount":21},{"anchorAddress":"0x11223873365B8BE6cED2A6F50a579F2D5a472Aa2","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31432087,"createdByAddress":"0xBeEC53eA2354784525ba3C8b2732f978934648DC","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"72","metadata":{"signature":"0x4cf95f65ebc5d53085c34e73219190a9212e4e498be034d77c5ccbed21a4ee1359caeebbc2adcebda078515082adc7a666aac6a2fc505f962625a640042799c61c","application":{"round":"0xAd3D6Ed8D631480C2461CC431E2ADA0eb1c97d54","answers":[{"type":"email","answer":"kachi1753@gmail.com","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Borderless Tech Hub UNN - Ifeanyi Princewill","hidden":false,"question":"Which B<>rder/ess University Web3 Tech Club are you affiliated with and state the web3 Tech Club Leads name?","questionId":1},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"I am a Web3 writer, community builder, and sustainability advocate focused on education, onboarding, and engagement in the blockchain space.

As a volunteer, I assisted with event logistics.\n\nContent Creation Through Threads: I’ve written educational threads on X to onboard users into Web3, focusing on university students:  \nA thread promoting Borderless 3.0 Byte Onchain event reached 1,000+ users.  \n\nA thread on XDegen for newbies reached 600+ users, with 32 engaging via likes/replies.  \n\nA thread on UpRock and DePIN infrastructure reached 50+ users, with several DMing for more info.\n\nWeb3 Clan WhatsApp Community: I created and moderate the Web3 Clan WhatsApp community with my brother Ateh, which includes groups like Blockchain Resources, Web3 Bounty Hub, and Tech Events and Webinars. The community grew from 70+ to 160 members in the Web3 Bounty Hub group alone, providing resources, bounty guidance, and event updates.\n\nProposed Project: Public Beats Concert\nI propose the Public Beats Concert, a music-driven event at Rivers State University to onboard 100-200 students into Web3. The event will feature live performances by student artists (including myself) to draw a diverse crowd, followed by workshops on Web3 fundamentals (e.g., setting up crypto wallets, making on-chain transactions), led by university tech clubs like Borderless Tech Club UNIPORT.

The community is made up of different groups like Blockchain Resources - where I share educational resources on Web3 to newbies, - Web3 Bounty Hub - where I teach newbies how to apply for bounties, thread contests, and more, I share my expertise having written amazing threads in the past, - Tech Events and Webinars - where I share upcoming tech and Web3 events and webinars. The Web3 Clan WhatsApp community, which I created and moderate with my brother Ateh, grew in numbers on the first day of creation, especially the Web3 Bounty Hub group which grew from 70+ members to 160 at the moment. I’ve onboarded over 100 newbies by sharing resources, teaching bounty applications, and promoting events.\n\n\n\n#I’d like to propose a Public Beats Concert—a music-driven event to onboard university students into Web3 at Rivers State University.\n\nMy motivation for hosting the Public Beats Concert stems from my firsthand understanding of how music can bridge communities and make complex concepts like blockchain more accessible. Having witnessed the impact of events like Borderless 3.0, where I performed alongside my bandmate Jerry and supported onboarding efforts, I saw how combining entertainment with education can engage diverse audiences. I want to replicate this model at my university, using music as a universal language to introduce students to Web3, foster innovation, and strengthen the Web3 community on campus.\n\n\n#Event Concept\nThe Public Beats Concert, an event at Rivers State University designed to onboard 100-200 students into the Web3 ecosystem through a unique blend of live music performances and educational workshops. The concert will feature performances by well-known student artists (including myself), creating an engaging atmosphere that draws students in, followed by interactive workshops on Web3 fundamentals. These workshops, led by university tech club members or Web3 educators, will cover practical topics like setting up a crypto wallet, making on-chain transactions, and understanding public goods—core concepts of the Web3 ecosystem. To enhance the experience, I’ll provide attendees snacks and drinks, create a welcoming environment, and distribute a short guide, “Web3 for Musicians,” to show how blockchain can benefit artists (e.g., through NFTs or fair royalty distribution).\n\nThe event will promote blockchain education and innovation by making Web3 accessible to non-technical students who might not attend traditional tech workshops. Music will serve as the hook, drawing a diverse crowd, while the workshops will provide hands-on learning opportunities. I’ll also incorporate a live demonstration of a public goods donation (e.g., donating to a Gitcoin Grant on the Celo blockchain), showing students how they can contribute to the ecosystem in real-time. Expected outcomes include onboarding 100-200 students into Web3, with at least 50 creating their first crypto wallet and 20 making their first on-chain transaction during the event. Additionally, the “Web3 for Musicians” guide will inspire at least 10 artists to explore blockchain applications in their careers.\n\n#How This Funding Supports the Public Beats Concert:\n\nThis funding will support the Public Beats Concert by covering essential event costs and enabling me to purchase a semi-acoustic guitar. The guitar will ensure a high-quality performance that creates an engaging atmosphere, drawing 100-200 students to the event and inspiring them to explore Web3 through our workshops, while also equipping me to perform at future Web3 events, like a regional concert series with Borderless Tech Club UNIPORT, to onboard more students across African universities.\n\n\n\n#Impact and Benefits\nThe Public Beats Concert will significantly contribute to the growth of the Web3 community within Rivers State University by creating a new entry point for students to engage with blockchain technology. By combining music with education, the event will attract a diverse audience, including non-technical students who might otherwise feel intimidated by Web3. This inclusivity aligns with the grant’s goal of fostering blockchain education in African universities, as it ensures that students from various disciplines—arts, humanities, sciences—can participate and learn. The concert will also build a community of music lovers interested in Web3, potentially leading to the formation of a Web3-focused music club on campus.\n\nThe event will foster collaboration between creative and tech communities at the university, bridging a gap that often exists in Web3 education. I plan to partner with university tech clubs, such as Borderless Tech Club UNIPORT, Solana All-Stars, Blockchain RSU, and Blockchain UNIPORT to lead the workshops and provide technical expertise. Additionally, I’ll leverage my network from attending 20+ Web3 events to invite influencers or educators from Borderless, Solana All-Stars, or Lisk to speak at the event and promote it on X, amplifying its reach. \n\n#Conclusion\nThe Public Beats Concert is a unique opportunity to onboard 100-200 students into Web3 at Rivers State, using music as a universal language to make blockchain education accessible and engaging. By combining live performances with hands-on workshops, the concert will foster innovation, build a Web3 community on campus, and create a replicable model for music-based onboarding. \n\nI’m thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem through this grant, and I’m committed to making the Public Beats Concert a success. With the support of the \"Web3 for Universities\" grant, I’ll create a memorable event that not only onboards students but also inspires them to explore blockchain innovation, strengthening the Web3 community in African universities.\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectTwitter":"ifeanyi70765182"},"recipient":"0xdC659419F0B702ff9CDbB01F7f3978f756109168"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreicm537v7vgnlpwyrgzbiz4ofuudj5gngvmjxcvd7xkjfjcri3quem","projects":[{"name":"Public Beats Concert","id":"0x62066c87b9740bea9855118782cec57048ce3979e8bc040695c6c00c640d6abc","metadata":{"title":"Public Beats Concert","logoImg":"bafkreid2iwfwkogl6hodvx3gommqrro4zk5pvni46qkouzc2j3waf6odhu","website":"https://www.notion.so/About-Me-1c4a974b312a80d8ac21fa8cb8c1c937?pvs=4","bannerImg":"bafybeif7gxd7gib2g3whexvwfvnlrlsjcmkli5gsqon6tto7kj5gmfuaty","createdAt":1743213103954,"credentials":{"twitter":{"type":["VerifiableCredential"],"proof":{"type":"EthereumEip712Signature2021","created":"2025-03-29T10:07:55.613Z","@context":"https://w3id.org/security/suites/eip712sig-2021/v1","proofValue":"0xb9455a4200a1bdda0cbc95bc1bf9aa80a038f3bd6fe0d6c15fc2b1990d01a4cc3b24bde5dba37d95d60e65d546e1a406267fef63ceb58c5a4f26fa90f774d19e1c","eip712Domain":{"types":{"Proof":[{"name":"@context","type":"string"},{"name":"created","type":"string"},{"name":"proofPurpose","type":"string"},{"name":"type","type":"string"},{"name":"verificationMethod","type":"string"}],"@context":[{"name":"nullifiers","type":"NullifiersContext"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"Document":[{"name":"@context","type":"string[]"},{"name":"credentialSubject","type":"CredentialSubject"},{"name":"expirationDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuanceDate","type":"string"},{"name":"issuer","type":"string"},{"name":"proof","type":"Proof"},{"name":"type","type":"string[]"}],"EIP712Domain":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"CredentialSubject":[{"name":"@context","type":"@context"},{"name":"nullifiers","type":"string[]"},{"name":"id","type":"string"},{"name":"provider","type":"string"}],"NullifiersContext":[{"name":"@container","type":"string"},{"name":"@type","type":"string"}]},"domain":{"name":"VerifiableCredential"},"primaryType":"Document"},"proofPurpose":"assertionMethod","verificationMethod":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb#controller"},"issuer":"did:ethr:0xd6f8d6ca86aa01e551a311d670a0d1bd8577e5fb","@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1","https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"],"issuanceDate":"2025-03-29T10:07:55.613Z","expirationDate":"2025-06-27T10:07:55.613Z","credentialSubject":{"id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xdC659419F0B702ff9CDbB01F7f3978f756109168","@context":{"provider":"https://schema.org/Text","nullifiers":{"@type":"https://schema.org/Text","@container":"@list"}},"provider":"ClearTextTwitter#ifeanyi70765182","nullifiers":["v0.0.0:N3SorAFhlZsAXSU2781yTesbRTz3TfHPLNuOYDxRIWs="]}}},"description":"GM GM,\n\nI’m Ifeanyichukwu Maulepe Ugoji, a Virtual Assistant, Content Creator, Guitarist, Performer, and dedicated Web3 Contributor and Creative who has been actively involved in the Web3 ecosystem after joining the Borderless Web3 Community in November 2023. \n\nOver the past 16 months, I’ve attended more than 20 tech events, including Web3 initiatives hosted by Borderless, Solana All-Stars, Lisk, and other leading brands, focusing on African university communities. \n\nAs a member of the Borderless community, I’ve contributed to onboarding and career grooming in blockchain education through my diverse roles: as a Virtual Assistant researching Web3 job opportunities, a content creator writing educational threads, a performer engaging audiences, and a volunteer facilitating onboarding at events like the Borderless Public Goods Concert (Borderless 3.0).\n\nCareer Grooming Through Virtual Assistance: As a Virtual Assistant for the Borderless community, I researched and compiled a comprehensive list of remote tech job opportunities and freelance roles in Web3 development, blockchain, and UI/UX design, tailored to the skills of Borderless Web 3 Community members, many of whom are university students or recent graduates.

Based on the engagement I observed, this thread reached 50+ users, with users commenting or DMing me to learn more about joining UpRock.\n\n\n\n\n#My Direct Contribution to onboarding newbies into Web3\n\nI also created and moderate a WhatsApp Community alongside my younger brother Ateh, called Web3 Clan that helps newbies navigate this complex world of Web3.\n\nI share my experiences from attending Borderless events, workshops, and other Web3 events. The community is made up of different groups like Blockchain Resources - where I share educational resources on Web3 to newbies, - Web3 Bounty Hub - where I teach newbies how to apply for bounties, thread contests, and more, I share my expertise having written amazing threads in the past, - Tech Events and Webinars - where I share upcoming tech and Web3 events and webinars. The Web3 Clan WhatsApp community, which I created and moderate with my brother Ateh, grew in numbers on the first day of creation, especially the Web3 Bounty Hub group which grew from 70+ members to 160 at the moment. I’ve onboarded over 100 newbies by sharing resources, teaching bounty applications, and promoting events.\n\n\n\n#I’d like to propose a Public Beats Concert—a music-driven event to onboard university students into Web3 at Rivers State University.\n\nMy motivation for hosting the Public Beats Concert stems from my firsthand understanding of how music can bridge communities and make complex concepts like blockchain more accessible. Having witnessed the impact of events like Borderless 3.0, where I performed alongside my bandmate Jerry and supported onboarding efforts, I saw how combining entertainment with education can engage diverse audiences. I want to replicate this model at my university, using music as a universal language to introduce students to Web3, foster innovation, and strengthen the Web3 community on campus.\n\n\n#Event Concept\nThe Public Beats Concert, an event at Rivers State University designed to onboard 100-200 students into the Web3 ecosystem through a unique blend of live music performances and educational workshops. The concert will feature performances by well-known student artists (including myself), creating an engaging atmosphere that draws students in, followed by interactive workshops on Web3 fundamentals. These workshops, led by university tech club members or Web3 educators, will cover practical topics like setting up a crypto wallet, making on-chain transactions, and understanding public goods—core concepts of the Web3 ecosystem. To enhance the experience, I’ll provide attendees snacks and drinks, create a welcoming environment, and distribute a short guide, “Web3 for Musicians,” to show how blockchain can benefit artists (e.g., through NFTs or fair royalty distribution).\n\nThe event will promote blockchain education and innovation by making Web3 accessible to non-technical students who might not attend traditional tech workshops. Music will serve as the hook, drawing a diverse crowd, while the workshops will provide hands-on learning opportunities. I’ll also incorporate a live demonstration of a public goods donation (e.g., donating to a Gitcoin Grant on the Celo blockchain), showing students how they can contribute to the ecosystem in real-time. Expected outcomes include onboarding 100-200 students into Web3, with at least 50 creating their first crypto wallet and 20 making their first on-chain transaction during the event. Additionally, the “Web3 for Musicians” guide will inspire at least 10 artists to explore blockchain applications in their careers.\n\n#How This Funding Supports the Public Beats Concert:\n\nThis funding will support the Public Beats Concert by covering essential event costs and enabling me to purchase a semi-acoustic guitar. The guitar will ensure a high-quality performance that creates an engaging atmosphere, drawing 100-200 students to the event and inspiring them to explore Web3 through our workshops, while also equipping me to perform at future Web3 events, like a regional concert series with Borderless Tech Club UNIPORT, to onboard more students across African universities.\n\n\n\n#Impact and Benefits\nThe Public Beats Concert will significantly contribute to the growth of the Web3 community within Rivers State University by creating a new entry point for students to engage with blockchain technology. By combining music with education, the event will attract a diverse audience, including non-technical students who might otherwise feel intimidated by Web3. This inclusivity aligns with the grant’s goal of fostering blockchain education in African universities, as it ensures that students from various disciplines—arts, humanities, sciences—can participate and learn. The concert will also build a community of music lovers interested in Web3, potentially leading to the formation of a Web3-focused music club on campus.\n\nThe event will foster collaboration between creative and tech communities at the university, bridging a gap that often exists in Web3 education. I plan to partner with university tech clubs, such as Borderless Tech Club UNIPORT, Solana All-Stars, Blockchain RSU, and Blockchain UNIPORT to lead the workshops and provide technical expertise. Additionally, I’ll leverage my network from attending 20+ Web3 events to invite influencers or educators from Borderless, Solana All-Stars, or Lisk to speak at the event and promote it on X, amplifying its reach. \n\n#Conclusion\nThe Public Beats Concert is a unique opportunity to onboard 100-200 students into Web3 at Rivers State, using music as a universal language to make blockchain education accessible and engaging. By combining live performances with hands-on workshops, the concert will foster innovation, build a Web3 community on campus, and create a replicable model for music-based onboarding. \n\nI’m thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem through this grant, and I’m committed to making the Public Beats Concert a success. With the support of the \"Web3 for Universities\" grant, I’ll create a memorable event that not only onboards students but also inspires them to explore blockchain innovation, strengthening the Web3 community in African universities.\n","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectTwitter":"ifeanyi70765182"},"metadataCid":"bafkreifasn63skqisrrwcarofqn532ozfxzgw6vmn2vixscxleryyfsz5u","timestamp":"2025-03-29T01:53:13+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0xdC659419F0B702ff9CDbB01F7f3978f756109168","createdAtBlock":31312435}],"projectId":"0x62066c87b9740bea9855118782cec57048ce3979e8bc040695c6c00c640d6abc","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"27","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T10:54:24.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31344906"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-03-31T19:29:25.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31548607"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":31627491,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-29T10:54:24+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x373e0165CdBD0E67b7D3E5C884fF12f1A9548F60","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31447310,"createdByAddress":"0x524C9119a6C672a6A6A44606054CdeE20e9B144b","distributionTransaction":null,"donations":[],"donationsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":0,"sum":{"amountInUsd":null,"amountInRoundMatchToken":null,"amount":null,"blockNumber":null}}},"id":"74","metadata":{"signature":"0x7f3bae2ad11a4e9621c13536e1c5a0e76ae570c5cd16bc3b5470f5a990bda9174b71903c42239655ffe19287e5a8b7d5a8cc9ecee94a62921b87fe32c14df1f91c","application":{"round":"0xAd3D6Ed8D631480C2461CC431E2ADA0eb1c97d54","answers":[{"type":"email","answer":"ronniemwanje94@gmail.com","hidden":true,"question":"Email Address","questionId":0},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"Demystifying Blockchain (web3 events UG)  - Mwanje Ronnie","hidden":false,"question":"Which B<>rder/ess University Web3 Tech Club are you affiliated with and state the web3 Tech Club Leads name?","questionId":1},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"raising awareness about blockchain and web3 innovations","hidden":false,"question":"Give a summary of your project or your work as an individual, include impact measurement reports (Qualitative & Quantitative).","questionId":2},{"type":"short-answer","answer":"N/A","hidden":true,"question":"If you are a developer applying with your project, please state the B<>rder/ess Cipher Session you attended, the course and your full name.
