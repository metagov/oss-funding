                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

By integrating certification with lifelong royalties, EA Kazi ensures that trainers are incentivized to provide high-quality education, while trainees gain verifiable credentials that enhance their job prospects. Built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts, EA Kazi combines the best aspects of platforms like Udemy and Freelancer into a single, cohesive ecosystem. This innovative approach creates a seamless connection between learning and earning, fostering a community of skilled professionals and reputable trainers.\n\nThe Problem:\nIn the current digital economy, the demand for verifiable skills and experienced freelancers is higher than ever. However, several challenges persist: Lack of Verifiable Credentials: Many online courses provide certificates that are easily forged or lack credibility, making it difficult for employers to trust the qualifications of potential hires. Trainer Incentives: Trainers often receive one-time payments for their courses, which disincentivizes them from continually updating and improving their content. Fragmented Platforms: Freelancers must navigate multiple platforms for training and job opportunities, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.\n\nEA Kazi’s Solution:\nEA Kazi addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform where training, certification, and job opportunities coexist seamlessly: NFT Certificates: Upon completing a course, trainees receive NFT certificates stored on the Stellar blockchain. These certificates are immutable and easily verifiable by potential employers, ensuring the credibility of the trainee's skills. Lifelong Royalties for Trainers: Trainers earn royalties from the projects trainees complete using their certifications. This continuous revenue stream incentivizes trainers to maintain high-quality, relevant content. Integrated Ecosystem: EA Kazi combines training, certification, and job opportunities on one platform. Trainees can easily transition from learning to earning, while recruiters can access a pool of verified, skilled freelancers.\n\nUser Dashboards:\nFreelancer/Trainee Dashboard: Displays available courses, job opportunities, and payment information. Trainees can track their certifications and apply for jobs directly through the platform. Recruiter Dashboard: Enables recruiters to post job opportunities and review applications from certified freelancers. Recruiters can easily verify the credentials of applicants, streamlining the hiring process. Trainer Dashboard: Allows trainers to list courses, track their trainees, and view their royalty earnings. Trainers can see the impact of their courses and adjust content based on trainee success.\n\nIntegration with Stellar and Soroban Smart Contracts:\nEA Kazi leverages the Stellar blockchain and Soroban smart contracts to ensure a secure, efficient, and transparent platform. Here's how it integrates: NFT Creation and Management: Soroban smart contracts handle the creation, issuance, and management of NFT certificates. These contracts ensure that each certificate is unique, verifiable, and immutable. Royalty Distribution: Soroban smart contracts automate the distribution of royalties to trainers. Every time a trainee secures and completes a project using their NFT certificate, the smart contract ensures that the trainer receives their rightful share. Secure Transactions: Stellar’s blockchain provides fast, low-cost transactions, making it ideal for managing payments between trainees, trainers, and recruiters. This efficiency ensures that all stakeholders receive their payments promptly and without unnecessary fees.\n\nConclusively, EA Kazi represents a significant advancement in the integration of training and employment within the digital economy. By leveraging the power of Stellar and Soroban smart contracts, EA Kazi ensures that every stakeholder benefits from a transparent, secure, and efficient system. Trainers are incentivized to provide the best possible education, trainees gain verifiable and valuable credentials, and recruiters can trust the skills of the freelancers they hire. This holistic approach addresses critical gaps in the current landscape and paves the way for a more connected and credible freelance economy.",

For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet.

USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution.

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",

                        "stellar.productsAndServices": "Our app aids financially underserved refugees and unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Africans lack adequate banking. For example, 350 Million people are unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, millions of refugees don’t have financial access. Refugees often encounter hurdles accessing traditional banking due to language barriers, documentation challenges, and unfamiliarity with other financial options.\n\nOur app, utilizing Stellar, tackles these issues by providing vital services like remittance, digital wallets, payments, crowdfunding, rotating savings and credit associations, and virtual cards. These solutions are crafted to offer refugees and unbanked individuals secure and affordable access to financial services, bolstering their financial inclusion and stability.\n\nRemittance & Payment\n\nProblem: In Sub-Saharan Africa, refugees and locals heavily rely on remittances from developed countries, facing high costs from existing providers—around 8% or more, including unfavorable exchange rates. Many resort to expensive Hawala networks for cross-border payments due to limited banking access.\n\nSolution: Our system facilitates fast, secure remittance primarily for refugees and unbanked populations across 21 African countries. We leverage USDC transactions, establishing our own on/off-ramp system of agents and partnering with Stellar Network Anchors where necessary. USSD functionality ensures swift, secure payments for users without reliable internet access.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Senders and receivers will get Stellar wallets where they will be able to send and receive money, by depositing and sending in USDC. Once the beneficiary receives the amount in her wallet, she can easily cash out the funds using our on/off ramp. This will make the remittance delivery cheap and fast.\n\nSaving\n\nProblem: Our target audience commonly resorts to holding their savings in cash, posing security risks, especially for refugees and low-income persons in crowded accommodations. There's a pressing need for a secure money storage solution. Moreover, local currency inflation exacerbates the risks of prolonged cash holding.\n\nSolution: Our app enables users to securely deposit and save cash in USDC, safeguarding against inflation and theft. Developed in native languages it ensures accessibility. We'll establish a proprietary on/off ramp system, leveraging local businesses and our agent network for convenient cash-out.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: Integrating with Stellar wallets allows users to easily deposit funds in USDC, enabling secure savings and protection against inflation.\n\nCommunal Funding\n\nProblem: In African societies, a strong tradition of community support exists, aiding those in need with expenses like hospital bills and funeral costs. However, online crowdfunding poses challenges for our target audience, including high processing fees and difficulty in delivering funds to beneficiaries without access to financial institutions.\n\nSolution: Leveraging our system, users can securely and affordably transfer funds to designated beneficiaries. Upon reaching the predetermined funding threshold, beneficiaries can promptly cash the much-needed funds via our off-ramp system.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets for such collections, allowing the beneficiary herself to access these funds, streamlining the collection processes, making it easy and efficient. Additionally, cashing out will be easy.\n\nRotating Savings and Credit Associations\n\nProblem: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) are highly popular in African societies, where members regularly contribute a fixed amount to a communal fund. Each member then takes turns receiving the total pooled amount, providing access to a lump sum. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for unbanked individuals. However, there is currently no secure method to facilitate ROSCAs for groups spread across different localities, which is common for refugees dispersed in various countries.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create wallets on our app and once they subscribe to a group for ROSCA, payment will be made from their wallet to the common wallet. And when all the members of the group accept, the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary wallet.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will designate wallets specifically for such collections, allowing ROSCA groups easy collection and disbursement.\n\nVirtual Card\n\nProblem: Majority of Sub-Saharans don’t have access to card payment, blocking them out of the international financial system. They can't purchase online causing many difficulties.\n\nSolution: We will enable people to create and fund virtual cards from their Stellar wallet by partnering with third-party card issuing companies. Through this way, people could easily access international payments by paying in their local currency.\n\nHow it works with Stellar: We will integrate Stellar wallets with the third-party companies to seamlessly transfer funds from wallets to virtual cards.",
