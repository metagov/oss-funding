    "description": "We would love to enter into the CELO ecosystem and leverage its technology for a dedicated effort that based on our market research could make it a great fit to be executed on the CELO Rails.\n\nLeverage cStables & Celo SAFE to bootstrap a low-interest Loans Program for the Community of Farmers who adapt to use our planting methodologies, the Kokonut Framework or Enroll into our Training Program to be developed in the Kokonut Genesis Project.\n\nWe think that a Loans Program is the right onboarding tool to implement other solutions like Hypercerts, Karma GAP and EBF Framework to measure local community impact for our efforts.\n\nIf we were to be approved into the program, we could use the matching funds to bootstrap the program, by starting with a Local Exchanger of cStables that act as the Clearing House for the local community to turn their Tokens into Fiat and Vice versa.\n\nWe will be donating the yield generated by the initiative to the Kokonut Foundation to support their initiatives and further development & augmentation of the value by leveraging the Foundation's Perpetual Value Flywheel\n\nKokonut Genesis Video: https://youtu.be/dahodOC6Aa0?si=SzJSNZmppMMeKDbC",
