There are a lot of practical web3 applications that people can use, but adoption could be much higher. One big hurdle for user adoption is access to services, steep learning curves, and complicated user experiences. We want to simplify the user experience and promote the use cases rather than the underlying technology.

Flora makes it easier for users to transact and engage. We want to make it easy for our users to access a variety of curated services that helps them make use of the Stellar network. Flora gives users access to apps and services for specific use cases, focuses on business, and aims to allow business owners to assemble their value chain much more quickly. These apps include transactions, governance tools, voting modules, invoicing, payment services, and third-party services.

First, we will focus on transactions and transaction templates. Users can set transaction parameters through intuitive wizards and with human-friendly language. Some templates will include legal guidance to help users attach documents as legal proof of their transactions and improve user comfort.

Transaction templates can be described as UI components for Stellar for smart contracts, both Classic Stellar Smart Contracts and transactions and later for Soroban Smart Contracts. Our focus is on business owners and project creators that want to bring their traditional business closer to DeFi and web3.

All users will require a Stellar wallet to keep their assets safe and secure. We will seek a relationship with developers on Stellar for support and the development of more apps and integrations, support growth, and contribute to user adoption on the network.",,,https://www.mojoflower.io,,https://vimeo.com/765435872/b00af8d37f,,,,,,,√ìlafur P√°ll Torfason,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mojoflower/,https://twitter.com/home/Mojoflower,,

CashAbroad is a web platform where businesses in Latam can send and receive cross-border payments from international merchants and vendors with low-cost, instant transactions and a group of smart features that make your paying journey a pleasure.

ü§î Problem

Paying vendors is disorganized and inefficient because approvals, invoices, and payments are often on different channels, like WhatsApp, emails, and paper bills. Moreover, Mexican companies lose up to +9-12% in revenue in cross-border payments and spend up to 30 hours or more a month on payment transactions, a time that would be best spent on strategy. These businesses also struggle with liquidity due to long settlement times, which push them to use credits or loans (more costs!) to keep their businesses running. On top of that, they spend effort and time redoing their invoices due to constant exchange rate fluctuations. We are creating features to help them do their job smoothly and pain-free.

- Pay/receive directly with your local currency to merchants abroad in dollars or their local currency.
- Automatic Payments | Schedule a one-time/recurrent date to pay one or multiple recipients; great for utility bills or salaries.
- Mass Payments | Pay simultaneously to multiple users. Great for paying salaries!
- Invoices | Sent invoices with smart adjustments to request payments (USD/local currency).
- Accounting Imports | Download your transaction history to use it on your favorite accounting software.
- Approvals | Invite collaborators and request approvals, for example, from accounting or you!

With Cashabroad, businesses of small and medium sizes like developing, design, marketing agencies, people that give courses online, consultants, real estate, and others will be able to open their frontiers.

We have been building the infrastructure needed to connect legacy carbon markets with the new digital economy taking place on public ledgers. Other companies building on Stellar will be able to integrate our backend service into their products and services, to give users easy access to carbon offsets. On top of this infrastructure, Stellarcarbon itself wants to develop and launch a retail shop for carbon offsetting aimed at individuals and businesses.

A major problem that voluntary carbon markets have faced over the past decades is low trustworthiness, on both the supply and demand side. While several governance bodies have stepped up to increase the integrity of carbon markets, it is still possible for providers to offer carbon credits without any oversight. Stellarcarbon addresses this problem by only working with a subset of VCS and CCB certified offsets, and by individually vetting projects.

Centralized registries are still essential, and we need to rely on them for the safeguards they provide. Unfortunately, they offer no way to intervene when an offset is used to make inaccurate claims about a company‚Äôs sustainability, or is even used to cover up environmental or social damage caused elsewhere. Stellarcarbon will develop terms of purchase that, together with a clawback mechanism, will allow us to invalidate malicious offsets on-chain.

Stellar provides us with the payment rails to fund offsets, and with transparent accounts onto which we can lock a carbon offset. An offsetter can pay with any liquid asset in their account to receive CARBON, select a vetted offset project to fund, and receive CarbonSINK as on-chain proof of retirement. Their offset is recorded in the Verra Registry, and the offsetter receives an off-chain certificate directly from Verra.",,,https://www.stellarcarbon.io/,,https://vimeo.com/753518986,,,,,,,"Alex Olieman, Adam Menary, Henk",,,https://x.com/stellarcarbon,,

By using a Layer 2 payment channel on Stellar called Starlight, we will create the effect of streaming payments. Users will be able to send payments on a per-second basis as they consume any service. Consumers will not be required to pay monthly subscriptions to access streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify or sign up for any service, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords. Consumers only need a pre-funded compatible wallet on their PC or mobile phone and choose what they want to read, see, listen, or use. By further applying this technology, we will develop the concept of payment bandwidth, which will translate to some amount of money per minute or second. Cell phone carriers, for example, could opt to charge different payment bandwidths for 3G, 4G, or 5G pay-as-you-go download speeds.

Today, 70% of Latin America's population remains unbanked or underbanked, and 58% of point-of-sales purchases are still made in cash. Consequently, over 400 million prepaid aggregate service subscribers in Latin America struggle with paying for utility services every month. Being excluded from the financial system and paying for recurring services is not only inconvenient and tiring; it is expensive. When handling prepaid customers, utility companies and merchants are subject to high fees, deductions, commissions from prepaid cards by vendors, and sometimes even interest. Paradoxically, these inefficiencies make the poor pay higher rates for services, making it expensive to be poor.

By building on Stellar, Paystreme will provide the fastest, most convenient, and most efficient way of paying for services. By using Stellar's Layer 2 payment channel, Starlight, we can process over 1 million payments per second per channel, making our platform highly scalable and efficient. Also, by partnering with MoneyGram and Stellar, we will be able to use hundreds of thousands of locations to onboard cash clients onto crypto. Unbanked consumers can use cash to pay for services at more competitive rates than before. Lastly, by integrating into Stellar's Anchor Platform, we will access traditional FIAT rails and allow banked users to easily top off their wallets.",,,www.mywalletguru.com,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFhQZ1f_Yr4,,,,,,,"Fernando Almi√±ana, emilianawalletguru",,https://www.linkedin.com/company/walletguru/,https://x.com/WalletGuruLLC,,

For more info see the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù section.

What problems do we solve?

Kata.Games deletes 3 problems simultaneously:

1) How can one create games and share them online efficiently?
We provide creators with a toolbox and the access (via KataSDK) to a brand new infrastructure. It allows anyone to create, host, share his/her independent game. The key benefit here is simplicity of use.

2) How do players connect with game creators in a fast and convenient way?
We‚Äôve built a proprietary technology capable of ‚Äústreaming‚Äù and running any kind of 2D game in the browser, along with its dedicated hosting solution for games.

3) How to make cryptocurrencies widely adopted widely?
We build a product that will attract and retain a large number of users due to its features and its innovative design. Using the Stellar network adds benefits: for players the diversity of games will be greater (because the barrier to entry is lowered for creators) and players will learn real-world technologies/skills while using our system!

Kata.Games' Stellar integration

Using Stellar allows us to:

- Provide a unified digital identity for the user. Such an identity can be used throughout many games, this is convenient. During registration, every new avatar gets associated with a pair: Stellar address, extra details‚Ä¶ Once it‚Äôs done the Stellar address contributes to authenticating a user. We use the Freighter wallet at Sign in and Sign up time, and integration of Albedo will be added.
- Secure the ownership of virtual goods. If the user buys a very valuable item in a given game, we will store the ownership on the Blockchain via an NFT. An extra benefit is being able to use the SDEX for trading virtual goods minted by us. Also, we‚Äôve introduced special game entities called ‚Äúportals‚Äù. Every portal is represented by an NFT-like token. Owning a portal implies that you can configure it to redirect to the game of your choice. In other words, you can own a part of our virtual world!
- Enhance the freemium model, speed up microtransactions. Transactions done via our system will be faster and more inclusive compared to competitors. Paying one‚Äôs premium status on Kata.Games will be done via cryptos. More specifically, we want to operate like a crypto exchange: fiat deposits will be possible (withdrawals too, but later in our company development) but fiat money will not be used at all when users are active within the system, only cryptos will.",,,https://linktr.ee/katagames,https://github.com/gaudiatech/kengi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyW6XXIGCNo,,,,,,,Thomas Iwaszko,,,https://x.com/createplayearn,,

The Kotani Pay API enables businesses to convert between digital assets and fiat and receive that through local payment channels in Africa. The API provides a single codebase for business with this need. This means businesses can receive money into mobile money or bank accounts in minutes over the Stellar Blockchain through the API.

Kotani Pay SMS/USSD Wallet

The Kotani Pay non-custodial wallet enables both non-internet enabled and internet enabled devices to interact with Blockchain protocols such as Stellar. The user simply dials a short code and is able to transact on the Stellar network. With the SMS wallet, one can receive, send, withdraw and access DeFi services.

We use the Stellar blockchain to hold the digital assets on-chain. The blockchain provides holding accounts for wallet users. The user interacts with the on-chain wallet through a USSD interface. Additionally, the Stellar blockchain acts as the transfer layer for on-chain remittance, cash-transfers, cross-border and gig-work transactions. A user sends funds from their blockchain account to another user‚Äôs account via Stellar.

But there is currently no way to get an activity overview and easily track the development among different Stellar organisations on Github, understand what is their status, track the contributions made by developers and get an idea on how the repositories evolve. It is really hard to understand how the Stellar ecosystem is progressing since the data is scattered all over GitHub, with contributors, commits, issues, repositories and PRs data.

The solution that CrossChain Labs presents is going to address the problems described above and will offer clarity on the open source Stellar‚Äôs developer ecosystem. This will be done by scraping the data related to Stellar‚Äôs organisations on GitHub and exposing it in a nicely designed dashboard that allows tracking the number of commits, repositories, contributors, PRs, the top contributors of the month, the evolution of commits and active contributors for each month over the last year and monitoring the recent commits that are being done in the various Stellar organisations.

The StellarPulse project will enable the interested parties to track the development among different Stellar organisations on Github, to follow the number of commits, repositories, contributors, PRs, the top contributors of the month, the evolution of commits and active contributors for each month over the last year and monitor the recent commits that are being done in the various Stellar organisations.",,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xq_f68zm5wgfFC0V6OQ9Po15iHNF9qdf/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,,Andreea Stefan,,,,,

sTeX,SCF #11,sTeX,sTeX,Developer Tooling,https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recYsvymcjyhXY4XV,Awarded,,SCF Legacy Award,$17000.00,$17000.00,194976.0,12/12/2022,Legacy v3.0 Award,"A modern cloud LaTeX editor with a google docs alike UX and UI, and a built-in Stellar decentralised documents marketplace.","The product I am presenting is sTeX, a cloud-based LaTeX editor featuring a modern user interface, as well as a fast and efficient user experience that aims to replicate Google Docs‚Äô one. At its core, the app will feature a decentralized marketplace for documents (including but not limited to sTeX‚Äôs) which is built upon the multisig safety of Stellar turrets.

LaTeX is a document preparation system that enables its users to write highly customizable and professional PDF documents. Rather than writing documents with formatted text, LaTeX lets you write documents in plain text, and uses markup tagging to define how the document looks like.

For example, both I and tdep#4794 use LaTeX almost on a daily basis for a variety of tasks: taking notes, product behavior design, writing whitepapers, technical writing, blogging, and working on financial instruments (for writing math).

Most LaTeX editors aren‚Äôt cloud-based and require you to install both the app and a TeX compiler as well, and the existing cloud-based LaTeX editors have room for improvement, especially in terms of user experience, interface, and sometimes speed (more on the competitors section in ‚Äúadditional information‚Äú). That is why I have decided to start working with tdep#4794 to build a brand-new modern LaTeX editor inspired by Google Docs.

The sTeX app will implement a decentralized marketplace at its core. Users will be able to effortlessly bring sTeX‚Äôs documents on-chain and have full control over them (sTeX‚Äôs app won‚Äôt have any signing power on your on-chain documents).

Once a document is on-chain (as a stellar account), we can officially call it a non-fungible-token (despite not being an actual stellar asset, tdep#4794 will discuss this NFT implementation later on this section). These NFTs can then be traded on a turrets-powered decentralized marketplace. The current progress in the marketplace as well as in sTeX‚Äôs ‚Äúdocument detach‚Äù API endpoints allow to: write a LaTeX document, create that document on-chain, place a sell offer through the marketplace to sell that document at a certain price, and place a buy offer through the marketplace to buy a document at its price.

Thanks to the design of the tokenized documents, they can be edited by the owner, meaning that interesting features like proofed document management can be achieved through the marketplace. For instance, you can issue an agreement contract you wrote to other two interested parties and set that the super-majority (2/3) consensus must be reached to edit the contract (for example three signers with a weight of 10 each and a medium threshold of 20).

The market is non-custodial and decentralized, based on stellar turrets. Turrets were initially called Turing Signing Server since what they actually do is leverage multisig and let serverless workers sign a ‚Äúcontract‚Äôs‚Äú transaction. This means that by using more than one turret which aren‚Äôt owned by the same entity we can achieve a certain degree of decentralization. We have chosen Turrets over Soroban for a couple of reasons: since we want to keep the document-as-account design, turrets seem like our only option given the limited access of soroban contracts to stellar ‚Äúclassic‚Äú data; we don‚Äôt need the degree of decentralization that native contracts offer given the fairly simple nature of our ‚Äúcontract‚Äù; it will probably be much cheaper to run the contract on Turrets rather than using a soroban contract (though that‚Äôs TBD depending on how soroban‚Äôs cost model works out); our contract is on its own concurrency-safe, thus it doesn‚Äôt need such model as described here.

Overall, by using Turrets we save time and resources since Stellar already provides all the features we need for this contract.

Lastly, we also mention a possibility for an in-app freelancing mechanism supported by the marketplace, but we won‚Äôt implement for now since it would require high community participation in voting for disputes, which is currently out of scope of our app‚Äôs simple and intuitive design.

Editor Features: secure and tested authentication and authorization, real-time compiler (our editor will display changes in the pdf as you finish writing your sentences), basic features (create, edit, share, manage access), templates (in development), advanced auto-completion, vs-code alike editor, commenting (in development), multiple themes (in development).

These are the features that are currently present in our editor, but feel free to recommend any that you deem interesting or necessary which we haven‚Äôt or aren‚Äôt implementing.

In the first submission, sTeX‚Äôs goal was to directly store document content on-chain. This approach had some advantages especially in delegating authorization to Stellar validators, and mostly by also allowing non-custodial users in our app. However, tests showed that the approach held important disadvantages in terms of speed and efficiency. That is why we opted to using native storage for sTeX‚Äôs API. This does not mean that we don‚Äôt use stellar anymore at our app‚Äôs core, as a matter of fact, all our infrastructure is made of ed25519 keypairs that are ready to become stellar accounts once sTeX‚Äôs users begin creating documents on chain or start interacting with the marketplace. When documents are on-chain, sTeX still enables to modify those documents re-using the code in sTeX‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst version‚Äú where every update corresponds to a stellar transaction. The only difference is that now users that are only interested in writing LaTeX documents in a fast and friendly environment can do so without suffering decreased speed for something they do not need, and those interested in editing their on-chain documents can do so in a completely non-custodial way by signing transactions as they update their documents.

The above only talks about the Stellar integration in the most ‚Äútraditional‚Äú part of our codebase (create, edit and share documents), the rest is completely reliant on both Horizon and Stellar (bridge to detach documents, bridge to reattach documents, the DeFi marketplace).

You can review part of our code here, but that‚Äôs just the marketplace‚Äôs prototype contract since we don‚Äôt want to make our API public (maybe yet). What we focus on is balancing and intersecting our ‚Äútraditional‚Äú codebase with our stellar-based one, and making sure that every interaction with Horizon is non-custodial on the user‚Äôs end.

On its own sTeX doesn‚Äôt bind much with Stellar being a LaTeX cloud environment, but with the built-in marketplace users who have probably never interacted with Stellar can experience for the first time Stellar in terms of payments speed and ease of possibly making of their documents a source of income.

sTeX‚Äôs backend facilitates the process of onboarding on-chain users without storing secrets or adding our signers to the users‚Äô accounts, allowing them to start interacting on-chain on their own and not only through our service.",,,https://stex.xycloo.com/,https://github.com/Xycloo/documents-marketplace-devenv,https://vimeo.com/751354524,,,,,,,"Federico Carlos De Ponti, Tommaso De Ponti",,,,,

Create a wallet to provide the easiest way to create accounts, sign transactions, and store keys securely on users' devices to ensure decentralisation. Ensure the wallet incorporates multiple login/signing popular options such as Albedo, Freighter, Rabet, Ledger, and Trezor. Provide Sep24 payment flows to ensure Stellar Anchor interoperability. Allow simple send and receive features within the wallet session time. Integrate Stellar swap functionality such as those features in the Albedo, LumenSwap, and Xbull wallet.

The Problem: To use the Stellar network, a user needs to create an account on Stellar, fund it via buying XLM to activate it. Then there are three main choices: Install a browser extension, use their private key directly on the website where they wish to spend their assets, or use a hard cold storage type wallet.

Numerous people will find this off-putting due to the cost of a hard cold storage wallet. Simply because those people doing so, many find the concept of installing a browser extension can be annoying or even in some cases too complex. Most users would find this user experience to be too time-consuming and overly challenging. It‚Äôs a time-consuming and laborious task that can lead to users like mum and dad or even Granny and Grandad excluding themselves from the Stellar experience.

In any case, ‚ÄúEnter your password to complete this login‚Äù is well understood by most. The only way to implement this login otherwise today is to use the private key directly on the website that generates the transaction, but users can‚Äôt be certain of what the website will actually do with their private keys.

Storing users' keys securely on their own devices. Enabling users to access their keys for login or signing with finger or face biometrics.

Spacewalk is the first bridge between the Stellar network and the Polkadot ecosystem. Bridging to one of the most popular Web3 ecosystems gives Stellar users more access to DeFi opportunities. Based on already tested infrastructure (XCLAIM and interBTC), Spacewalk is implemented as a Substrate (the blockchain framework on which Polkadot is built) pallet and allows any Substrate-based blockchain to implement a direct Stellar bridge.

Stellar Oracle

A key component of the bridge is the Stellar oracle, which relays the state of the Stellar network to external services (like a bridge). The Stellar oracle is decentralized and by design at least as secure as the Stellar network itself. While this oracle is developed with Spacewalk in mind, it can be used by other bridge services. By giving this oracle to the Stellar community, we hope to see more bridges being built to connect Stellar with the broader DeFi/Web3 world.",,,https://pendulumchain.org/,https://github.com/pendulum-chain/spacewalk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOAVV0dEN10,,,,,,,"Erasmus Hagen, Erasmus Hagen",,,,,
