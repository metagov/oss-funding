Every day, trees are cut down to meet the basic needs of food, fuel, medicine, and timber. But the cost of this necessity is growing dangerously high. The region is now at the forefront of one of the most severe environmental crises in Africa — deforestation.\nThe impacts are already devastating: unpredictable rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and extreme weather events like wind erosion are becoming the norm. These environmental changes are triggering cascading effects—soils are degrading, farmland is turning to desert, biodiversity is vanishing, and entire ecosystems are collapsing. Landslides are more frequent, and desertification is creeping into once fertile lands, displacing farmers and threatening food security.\nAccording to the United Nations, Nigeria leads the world in deforestation, losing an estimated 3.7% of its forests annually. This rapid loss is occurring in a country that holds Africa’s largest mangrove forest, of which only 6% is currently protected. The multiple ecological zones that once supported diverse livelihoods and agricultural practices are now under serious threat from climate change and environmental shocks.\nIf we do nothing, millions of people in this region face a future marked by poverty, hunger, and migration. Communities that once thrived will be forced to abandon their ancestral lands. The environmental degradation will continue to accelerate, contributing to global climate change and deepening socio-economic instability.\n\n\n 📜 Our Solution\n\nGreen Planet Conservation Initiative (GPCI), is a non-governmental organization championing environmental conservation, sustainable practices, and climate education. We’re actively restoring degraded ecosystems through agroforestry, reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and biodiversity protection, with a strong focus on climate education in schools and grassroots community engagement.\n\nAt GPCI, we believe that the path to climate resilience and environmental restoration lies in empowering communities and nurturing the next generation of eco-leaders. Our comprehensive Green Project Initiative directly addresses the urgent environmental crisis in Northern Nigeria—deforestation, land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate vulnerability—through a bold, multifaceted strategy.\n\nOur Green Project Initiative has been making remarkable impact in the following areas:\n\n- we plant trees in schools and communities, restoring degraded land, improving air quality, and promoting biodiversity.  By integrating agroforestry, we help farmers cultivate sustainable tree-crop systems that enhance food security while capturing carbon.\n\n- Education is a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. GPCI conducts climate awareness campaigns in schools and local communities to enlighten young people about environmental conservation. By engaging students in interactive learning sessions and tree-planting exercises, we foster a generation that understands the urgency of climate action.\n\n- GPCI advocates for Regenerative Agriculture, training farmers on eco-friendly farming practices such as cover cropping, crop rotation, composting, and water-efficient irrigation.\n\n- In collaboration with the Federal College of Forestry, we’re working to protect Pterocarpus erinaceus (African Rosewood), an endangered native species threatened by over-exploitation. Our preservation efforts not only protect this keystone species but help maintain the ecological balance in its native habitat.\n\n- We integrate Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (DMRV) technologies using Web3 to track the impact of our tree-planting and land restoration projects. By leveraging blockchain-based solutions, we ensure transparency, accountability, and data integrity in climate action efforts, making it easier to measure progress and attract funding.\n\n- Many vulnerable communities suffer the most from climate change due to poor access to resources. GPCI bridges this gap by providing knowledge, tools, and sustainable livelihood options. Our initiatives create opportunities for local farmers, students, and youth, empowering them to become active participants in environmental conservation.\n\n\n\n\n🖼️ See Our Impact\n\n\n![image](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-54785461074271092617603311796514682044416&w=384&q=75)\n\n🔗 [Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-54785461074271092617603311796514682044416)\n\n📝 What This Hypercert Represents:\n\nGreen Planet Conservation Initiative (GPCI) is driving transformative impact across communities through bold climate action and education.

These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. \nPaying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: \n•\tAct as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing;\n•\tuse high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, \n•\ttake a long time from submission to publishing;\n•\tundermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society;\n•\tauthors (scientists, professionals and, scholars), reviewers and most editors (also scientists) do not get paid for working in the peer-reviewing process of papers for science journals. \n•\tAuthors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) have their copyright expropriated. \n•\tUniversities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.\n\n\nSolution. A journal-as-a-service publications platform for collaborative creation of technical and scientific publications, leveraging web3 principles and technologies: 100% copyright to authors, different percentages of authorship (as built-in feature) and scientific assets construction (through blockchain registration). \n\n\nRoadmap and Timeline. Our plans for Version 4 focus on building a window showcase for registered projects and ideas, laying the foundation for a decentralized marketplace where researchers and startups can monetize scientific knowledge. This version will introduce a new revenue stream, with the platform earning a small fee on each register transaction while fostering transparent and open exchange (6 months). \nTo achieve these goals, the grant will be used to redesign and integrate the registration platform into the publishing platform, ensuring seamless UI and functionality (2 to 3 months). Additionally for version 4, we will scale up marketing efforts, organizing targeted events, workshops, and community activations to raise awareness and onboard new users (3 to 12 months). Through strategic collaborations, we aim to drive adoption and establish our platform as a leading force in decentralized science innovation, ultimately paving the way for a fully operational scientific marketplace in Version 5.","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"The DeSci Journals contribute to the DeSci ecosystem by providing a decentralized, open-access publishing infrastructure that enhances transparency, accessibility, and collaboration. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that research findings, peer reviews, and metadata remain openly accessible and verifiable, fostering trust and reproducibility. Our platform incentivizes knowledge creators, inventors, scientists and researchers through reputation systems and NFT-minted papers. We integrate with open-source repositories like GitHub and decentralized storage solutions, allowing researchers to directly link and publish code alongside their studies for proper citation. This enables permissionless collaboration, allowing global contributors to expand, fork, and improve open-source projects without institutional gatekeeping. Additionally, we embed open-source licenses and ensure long-term data preservation through decentralized storage, protecting contributions from being lost or paywalled. By facilitating transparent and immutable publishing, we help researchers showcase and validate their work more effectively. Our approach not only supports DeSci development but also strengthens the integrity of scientific research through open peer review.

A storytelling platform addressing the global loneliness epidemic\n\nEver seen Harry Potter? There is a scene where Albus Dumbledore uses his wand to remove a memory from his mind to empty into the Pensieve. Semicolon Fingers hopes to enable exactly that, but with all the benefits of web3, ie, it incentivises you to outpour your stories [read: empty your mugs] onto the network. The stories are represented as the balls of coloured yarn, as they usually are, by having them displayed in the form of interactive, clickable links. As the reader clicks, parts of the story are revealed. Think of it as pulling the threads of the yarn ball, and as the reader pulls more, the writer earns\\* more; because web3.\n\nIn this spirit, Semicolon Fingers is a storytelling platform tackling the global loneliness epidemic through an emotionally intelligent, token-incentivized web3 experience. By blending interactive text, sentiment analysis, and open-source infrastructure, it offers a new kind of human connection — one that is meaningful, measurable, and mental-health-forward.\n\nSee the application in action — [![youtube-demo-gg23-thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7HWkueO_RF4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7HWkueO_RF4?si=yQt1qHiockcr1JXB)\n\n### Why it Matters\n\nLoneliness is more than a feeling — it’s a public health crisis. Semicolon Fingers is built on the belief that stories, when shared and heard, are an antidote. By enabling readers to pull the thread of someone else’s story, we not only create empathy, but track and reward it. This is social impact, measurable and encoded.\n\n## How it works\n\nSemicolon Fingers has two entrypoints — the writing side (empty-your-mug) and the reading side (pull-my-thread); On the writing side, a user selects a colour (base emotion), a prompt (nuanced emotion), and writes their story. They then deploy their story on the network as a NFT contract (which is sponsored). On the reader side, a user is presented with a random story, coloured by its emotion, which they can unfurl to read, or stumble upon another story. This stumbling informs the rate at which new tokens are dripped to the writers of the stories being read.\n\n### Colours\n\nSemicolon Fingers follows the colour representation of HSL, ie, hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the degree of the colour on the colour wheel (from 0 to 359), saturation is defined as the intensity of the colour (from 0% to 100%), ie, how much grey is included, and lightness describes how much light, ie, white, the colour has (again, from 0% to 100%). In our context, each story is associated with an emotion or a mood, which translates to the hue of the story (ie, an angry story is red, so 0 deg., sad story is blue, so 240 deg.). The translation for saturation is straightforward, with the intensity of the story being represented as a percentage. Finally, lightness within Semicolon Fingers is twofold, on the writer side, it represents how _light_ the writer feels after emptying their mug, while on the reader side, it represents how _heavy_ a reader feels on reading the story. The expectation is that these two values would be inverses of each other, but that hypothesis remains to be validated through user interaction.\n\n### Telescopic Text\n\nA transformation that each story goes through is that of being converted to [_telescopic text_](https://telescopictext.org/). Telescopic text is a form of display where a piece of text is expanded by user interaction. At first, a user is presented with a few words, some of which can be clicked. Once such a word is clicked, more words are revealed, and the process follows. This is a novel way to utilize the capabilities of interactive systems like the web browser and create (or track) engagement for every piece of text. Semicolon Fingers uses the inherent properties of this feature to i. create a signal for writers as to how much their story is being read, if at all; and ii. consider each expansion to be a _mining event_, where new tokens are dripped to the writer, as their story is expanded, and read.\n\n### Stumbling\n\nInspired by [StumbleUpon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon), Semicolon Fingers' reader face (ie, pull-my-thread) only presents a random story (condensed in telescopic text as described above) and a big shuffle button. Readers now have the choice to either expand the story (unfurl the yarn, if you will) or stumble onto another story. As each story also has associated hue, saturation, and lightness values, these help in letting the reader perform a [_random walk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) based on their interaction with the site, creating a sort of emotional trail of the reader across the network, akin to wandering through a museum of unspoken feelings. The more a reader stumbles before settling on a story, the more tokens are earned by the writer, a reward for standing out in a sea of voices.\n\n### DeSci\n\nA (slightly) future mechanism of the project revolves around Decentralized Science. This will manifest across three key areas,\n1. **Sentiment Analysis** Above, we mentioned that each story is associated with a mood and an intensity. For the alpha version, a writer selects the mood of the story and then writes, while the intensity is kept constant at 50%. As a reader reads a story, they are prompted to enter in their perceived mood and intensity of the story they are reading. Over time, these data points (one from the writer, and many from the readers) will be used to perform sentiment analysis using Support Vector Machines, preferably onchain.\n2. **Global Emotion Heatmap** Provided there are many stories on the network, from across the world, a fascinating thing to look at would be what kinds of emotions (ie, colours) are emerging from various geographies. For instance, an area affected by war would likely have a lot of blue and red stories, or an area with a high satisfaction of living might have more yellow (ie, happy) emerging. This is an indirect way to ascertain the prevalent emotion of a place, as opposed to dry surveys.\n3. **Mental Health** Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Semicolon Fingers aims to make a dent in the mental health crises in the world. The hypothesis here is that a bunch of mental health conditions manifest due to humans not having a space to let their emotions out, and as a result bottling up their feelings. With a novel approach to tackling this loneliness, Semicolon Fingers aims to have positive downstream effects on mental health itself!\n\nAdditionally, all data is stored on-chain and is open by design, enabling researchers, DAOs, and mental health initiatives to access and build upon this emotional dataset.\n\n**a note about loneliness**\n\nSo far, loneliness is mentioned multiple times, but it may not be clear as to exactly how Semicolon Fingers addresses this. The idea here is that the tokens mined by the readers for the writers provides a strong signal that there is indeed someone out there who has heard, related to, and engaged with a story; after all, money (or tokens), in its purest form, is a signal. With the premise of each story being that they are deeply personal stories, Semicolon Fingers aims to bring about opportunities for [_fleeting intimacy_](https://feeld.co/ask-feeld/how-to/power-of-fleeting-intimacy). Humans are social creatures and the lack of (meaningful) social interaction is ailing our society. Semicolon Fingers aims to rectify that. Finally, as an aside, if we look back at how the internet gained momentum, a large part of it was through random individuals finding community on the network, and Semicolon Fingers is providing a new opportunity for the same. With the wonders of web3, this time around, maybe the connected individuals get something more than just connection and communion.\n\n## Project Timeline\n\n**2018** Discovery of telescopic text; initial ideas start forming.\n\n**2021** Project begins conceptualizing, with token mechanics and dataflow approaches.\n\n**2022** A small prototype created at ETHGlobal's NFT Hack to gauge interest.\n\n**2025 Q1** Work on MVP begins in earnest, with the idea presented multiple times.\n\n***2025 Q2*** Beta release.\n\n## Resources \n\nUp to date information can be found on the [community github repository](https://github.com/sliver-labs/semicolon-fingers). Since the project has been in ideation for a long time, and iterated upon several times, the repositories and other related material for the project is very spread out. As such, most current information will be available in the repository linked above, and will contain links to other repositories, along with docs, and community discussions.\n\nFor a demo of the project, you can check out [this video on youtube](https://youtu.be/7HWkueO_RF4?si=o0Ubhe-a63M-SaCa) (same as above).\n\n### Architecture\n\n**Base** The project effectively lives on Base. This choice is made deliberately owing to their deep integration with Coinbase. As one of the goals of Semicolon Fingers is to bring about effective change in the mental health crisis in the world, the hope is that any earnings of a writer may go into therapeutic costs.\n\n**Zora** There are two main types of NFTs for the users of Semicolon Fingers that would benefit tremendously by Zora's CoinSDK.\n\n**rollup** The core mechanics of the project is bundled on a rollup, which can be considered as an app chain.\n\n## How will funds be used\n\nFinally, any funding received as a result of this grant will go towards the following (in order),\n- Developer support, ensuring a full-time focus on the project\n- Deployment of beta version on mainnet \n- Security audits of the contracts and rollup infra\n- Sponsoring user transactions until the project becomes

Since the project has been in ideation for a long time, and iterated upon several times, the repositories and other related material for the project is very spread out. As such, most current information will be available in the repository linked above, and will contain links to other repositories, along with docs, and community discussions.\n\nFor a demo of the project, you can check out [this video on youtube](https://youtu.be/7HWkueO_RF4?si=o0Ubhe-a63M-SaCa) (same as above).\n\n### Architecture\n\n**Base** The project effectively lives on Base. This choice is made deliberately owing to their deep integration with Coinbase. As one of the goals of Semicolon Fingers is to bring about effective change in the mental health crisis in the world, the hope is that any earnings of a writer may go into therapeutic costs.\n\n**Zora** There are two main types of NFTs for the users of Semicolon Fingers that would benefit tremendously by Zora's CoinSDK.\n\n**rollup** The core mechanics of the project is bundled on a rollup, which can be considered as an app chain.\n\n## How will funds be used\n\nFinally, any funding received as a result of this grant will go towards the following (in order),\n- Developer support, ensuring a full-time focus on the project\n- Deployment of beta version on mainnet \n- Security audits of the contracts and rollup infra\n- Sponsoring user transactions until the project becomes self-sustaining","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"sliver-labs","projectTwitter":"sliverLabs"},"metadataCid":"bafkreifagbf2binsbyjgiob4gbfaifngmh7sfaqzrtg3pp74m3rhochrni","timestamp":"2025-03-31T21:02:32+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x9378Bc37A3d5668AdB1377dF6c2F8e23A95bcDDe","createdAtBlock":321580691},{"name":"Semicolon

MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerating coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n\n**When?**\n\n\n*2024-2030*\n\n\n- Develop a Web2+Web3 Interface\n- Expansion and Onboarding Efforts\n- Exploration of Web3 DAO Tools\n- Collaboration Partnerships and Initiatives\n- Research and Development Initiatives (i.e., Tokenomics, Biodiversity Credits)\n- Community Engagement and Transparency\n- Continuous Improvement and Adaptation\n- Pilot Programs and Proof of Concept: RegenReef (Fig. 4-5):\n\n\n   1. - Biobank of corals\n   2. - Coral and Fish Nursery\n   3. - Micropropagation Zone\n   4. - Disease and Bleaching Research Unit\n   5. - DeSci Web3 Collaboration Hub\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJoksYFXgAAqMf-?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nFig 4.

The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).\n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252F5iB319gFA87fE0i4ImEU%252FMesoReefDAO%2520Framework%2520Conservation.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db2a6e496-8306-4f57-8681-2838fa04713c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c5acf856&sv=1)\nFig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.\n\n\n**Mission** \nThe MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.\n\n\n**Vision**\n\n\nThe MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats and ecological connectivity; improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.\n\n\n**Problem**\n\n\nThe problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.\n\n\nHowever, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)\nFig 3. Coral Outplanting Areas in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\n\n**How?**\n\n\nMesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.\n\n\nThe framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerating coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4). \n\n\n![image](https://mesoreefdao-docs.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2449202462-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FJGihTqM6h5O7VTgjwbtE%252Fuploads%252Ftzv7MgJyup2EqHWaJUNK%252FMesoReefDAO%2520layers.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df10c510d-244b-4e42-9d56-02b232ba6a43&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=1e8fa88b&sv=1)\nFig 4.

The Five Steps of the Conservation and DeSci Web3 tools to explore adapted from Brown et al. (2022).\n\n\nOur proposed project includes:\n\n\n1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.\n\n\n2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.\n\n\n3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.\n\n\n4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n\n**When?**\n\n\n*2024-2030*\n\n\n- Develop a Web2+Web3 Interface\n- Expansion and Onboarding Efforts\n- Exploration of Web3 DAO Tools\n- Collaboration Partnerships and Initiatives\n- Research and Development Initiatives (i.e., Tokenomics, Biodiversity Credits)\n- Community Engagement and Transparency\n- Continuous Improvement and Adaptation\n- Pilot Programs and Proof of Concept: RegenReef (Fig. 4-5):\n\n\n   1. - Biobank of corals\n   2. - Coral and Fish Nursery\n   3. - Micropropagation Zone\n   4. - Disease and Bleaching Research Unit\n   5. - DeSci Web3 Collaboration Hub\n\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJoksYFXgAAqMf-?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nFig 4.

An onchain embodiment of your (financial) data, in the form of a pet monkey\n\n**What if your spending habits had a face — and a liver?**\n\nDash Mon[k]ey is an onchain tamagotchi that embodies your financial health. Inspired by behavioral science and the 90s craze of virtual pets, this project externalizes your “monkey brain” to help you visualize your habits and correct them—before it’s too late.\n\nIf your card statements show excessive clubbing, your monkey gets liver damage. Too much food delivery? Upset stomach. But a diet rich in leafy greens? Glowing fur and clear skin.\n\nYour monkey is you—just five steps further down the path you’re on.\n\nBy feeding it healthy recipes (habits), you improve both your life and your monkey’s fate. And because everything is onchain, your progress is visible, social, and collectible.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Expense Tracking\n\nTrack every cent through receipt uploads, bank statements, and more—parsed locally via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The structured data powers your monkey’s health and personalized dashboard visualizations. A mobile app makes it frictionless to snap and submit receipts.\n\nAs a bonus, we’re exploring decentralized OCR via federated learning. Users train a local model on their devices and submit updated weights for rewards. If successful, this could pioneer decentralized, privacy-first AI.\n\n### Recipe Marketplace\n\nInspired by copy trading, users can mint financial strategies as NFTs — automating everything from DCA to transfer 10% of income to savings. Your funds never leave your wallet until trade execution, reducing trust risks. Over time, healthy financial behavior unlocks access to rarer, more powerful recipes. Financial literacy becomes a game.\n\n### Health is Wealth\n\nOnce active, users can choose to link health data (e.g., steps, HR, sleep) for deeper insights. With demographics and spending, we can map real-world health outcomes to lifestyle choices—fully anonymized, locally processed, and optionally shared. The monkey was chosen precisely for its biological proximity to humans, making it the perfect proxy for experimentation.\n\n\n### Privacy by Design\n\n- All data is local-first\n- Encrypted before going onchain\n- Only high-level insights or state changes (e.g., liver damage) are public\n\nWe rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and ZK proofs where needed. We believe this is the only ethical way to handle health and financial data.\n\n# Project Timeline\n\n**2021** Project first conceptualized, following the announcement of the Account Aggregator network on the [IndiaStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Stack).\n\n**2023** Small projects built around independent features to gauge interest.\n\n**2025 Q1** Work on MVP begins in earnest, with the idea presented multiple times over the ethDenver and ethSF.\n\n***2025 Q2*** Alpha release.\n\n# Resources\n\nUp to date information can be found on the [community github repository](https://github.com/sliver-labs/dash-monkey).

An onchain embodiment of your (financial) data, in the form of a pet monkey\n\n**What if your spending habits had a face — and a liver?**\n\nDash Mon[k]ey is an onchain tamagotchi that embodies your financial health. Inspired by behavioral science and the 90s craze of virtual pets, this project externalizes your “monkey brain” to help you visualize your habits and correct them—before it’s too late.\n\nIf your card statements show excessive clubbing, your monkey gets liver damage. Too much food delivery? Upset stomach. But a diet rich in leafy greens? Glowing fur and clear skin.\n\nYour monkey is you—just five steps further down the path you’re on.\n\nBy feeding it healthy recipes (habits), you improve both your life and your monkey’s fate. And because everything is onchain, your progress is visible, social, and collectible.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Expense Tracking\n\nTrack every cent through receipt uploads, bank statements, and more—parsed locally via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The structured data powers your monkey’s health and personalized dashboard visualizations. A mobile app makes it frictionless to snap and submit receipts.\n\nAs a bonus, we’re exploring decentralized OCR via federated learning. Users train a local model on their devices and submit updated weights for rewards. If successful, this could pioneer decentralized, privacy-first AI.\n\n### Recipe Marketplace\n\nInspired by copy trading, users can mint financial strategies as NFTs — automating everything from DCA to transfer 10% of income to savings. Your funds never leave your wallet until trade execution, reducing trust risks. Over time, healthy financial behavior unlocks access to rarer, more powerful recipes. Financial literacy becomes a game.\n\n### Health is Wealth\n\nOnce active, users can choose to link health data (e.g., steps, HR, sleep) for deeper insights. With demographics and spending, we can map real-world health outcomes to lifestyle choices—fully anonymized, locally processed, and optionally shared. The monkey was chosen precisely for its biological proximity to humans, making it the perfect proxy for experimentation.\n\n\n### Privacy by Design\n\n- All data is local-first\n- Encrypted before going onchain\n- Only high-level insights or state changes (e.g., liver damage) are public\n\nWe rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and ZK proofs where needed. We believe this is the only ethical way to handle health and financial data.\n\n# Project Timeline\n\n**2021** Project first conceptualized, following the announcement of the Account Aggregator network on the [IndiaStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Stack).\n\n**2023** Small projects built around independent features to gauge interest.\n\n**2025 Q1** Work on MVP begins in earnest, with the idea presented multiple times over the ethDenver and ethSF.\n\n***2025 Q2*** Alpha release.\n\n# Resources\n\nUp to date information can be found on the [community github repository](https://github.com/sliver-labs/dash-monkey).

Also follow there: https://ekonavi.com/regen?r=E_co.lab\n\nE-co.lab is a project oriented towards multivalued projects (community, cultural, ecological and indicators), open to building partnerships and volunteering. It is located in Brazil, Goiás State, on Chapada dos Veadeiros, in the microregion of Goiás northeastern, approximately 270 km from Brasília, the federal capital, and 470 km from Goiânia, the state capital. It is part of the Natural World Heritage of Cerrado Protected Areas, part of the Pouso Alto Environmental Protection Area (APA de Pouso Alto) and is bordering the Kalunga Historical Site and Cultural Heritage (SHPCK).\n\nManagement and productive activities at E-co.lab are guided by permaculture, in the adoption of agroecology, bioconstruction, ecological tourism, recycle, and more, with the use of natural, organic and biodynamic bases, techniques and practices consistent with ecosystem respect on nature-based solutions (SBN). The projects are organized in e-co.lab's cores, which are:\n\nE-co.lab Agroecology - In agroecology, the diagnosis returned, briefly, to the presence of two distinct zones: naturally preserved areas and degraded areas for recovery. It was decided, in the initial stages, for agroextractivism in naturally preserved areas that are not fully protected, for the collection of non-timber forest products in naturally preserved areas and that are for full protection, and for production in Agroforestry Systems in the areas to be recovered. An Agroecological Network with all interested parties will also be promoted.\n\nE-co.lab Bioconstruction - When it comes to bioconstruction, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. E-co.lab Bioconstruction proves to be a priority, since the other e-co.lab's need shared infrastructure to be bioconstructed.\n\nE-co.lab Decentralized Science (Desci) - The community generates a lot of knowledge. In general, this knowledge is lost due to misdocumentation, and low recognition due to the lack of adoption of the appropriate scientific method. In this action we adopted a popular language to guide popular agents to document their practices and adopt the scientific method, generating Desci assets.\n\nE-co.lab Ecological Tourism - In ecological tourism, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. Unique and differentiated potentials in bathing and adventure tourism have already been identified, in addition to a potential link to the National Long-Distance Trails Network, in the Canoeiros Trail, north of the Goyazes Pathway.\n\nE-co.lab Recycle - When it comes to recycling, E-co.lab acts and provides support to institutions, collectives and individuals working in the collection, sorting, processing and disposal of waste.

Also follow there: https://ekonavi.com/regen?r=E_co.lab\n\nE-co.lab is a project oriented towards multivalued projects (community, cultural, ecological and indicators), open to building partnerships and volunteering. It is located in Brazil, Goiás State, on Chapada dos Veadeiros, in the microregion of Goiás northeastern, approximately 270 km from Brasília, the federal capital, and 470 km from Goiânia, the state capital. It is part of the Natural World Heritage of Cerrado Protected Areas, part of the Pouso Alto Environmental Protection Area (APA de Pouso Alto) and is bordering the Kalunga Historical Site and Cultural Heritage (SHPCK).\n\nManagement and productive activities at E-co.lab are guided by permaculture, in the adoption of agroecology, bioconstruction, ecological tourism, recycle, and more, with the use of natural, organic and biodynamic bases, techniques and practices consistent with ecosystem respect on nature-based solutions (SBN). The projects are organized in e-co.lab's cores, which are:\n\nE-co.lab Agroecology - In agroecology, the diagnosis returned, briefly, to the presence of two distinct zones: naturally preserved areas and degraded areas for recovery. It was decided, in the initial stages, for agroextractivism in naturally preserved areas that are not fully protected, for the collection of non-timber forest products in naturally preserved areas and that are for full protection, and for production in Agroforestry Systems in the areas to be recovered. An Agroecological Network with all interested parties will also be promoted.\n\nE-co.lab Bioconstruction - When it comes to bioconstruction, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. E-co.lab Bioconstruction proves to be a priority, since the other e-co.lab's need shared infrastructure to be bioconstructed.\n\nE-co.lab Decentralized Science (Desci) - The community generates a lot of knowledge. In general, this knowledge is lost due to misdocumentation, and low recognition due to the lack of adoption of the appropriate scientific method. In this action we adopted a popular language to guide popular agents to document their practices and adopt the scientific method, generating Desci assets.\n\nE-co.lab Ecological Tourism - In ecological tourism, the zoning and survey of available assets are in the process of diagnosis and geographic referencing. Unique and differentiated potentials in bathing and adventure tourism have already been identified, in addition to a potential link to the National Long-Distance Trails Network, in the Canoeiros Trail, north of the Goyazes Pathway.\n\nE-co.lab Recycle - When it comes to recycling, E-co.lab acts and provides support to institutions, collectives and individuals working in the collection, sorting, processing and disposal of waste. Improving adopted practices and complementing them with SBN and other innovative solutions is the main focus of this action.\n\nE-co.lab Regenerative Finance (ReFi) - Community agents involved in environmental regeneration actions, in general, lack digital inclusion and financial inclusion. ReFi supports the digital and financial inclusion of these agents, also providing possible income generation. In this action, we bring ReFi knowledge and practices to environmental regeneration agents, in simple, didactic and accessible language.","logoImgData":{},"bannerImgData":{},"projectGithub":"ecolab-web3","projectTwitter":"ecolab_web3"},"metadataCid":"bafkreieurabvw4svy7clzxumhyftnlaj77otbv3qfhdgcr7hjfiizwngvq","timestamp":"2025-03-18T18:26:05+00:00","registryAddress":"0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3","projectType":"canonical","projectNumber":null,"createdByAddress":"0x4B2bE391Da027155b21b725c37fF289A46d9C06c","createdAtBlock":30929557}],"projectId":"0xf4ae94950bf871a4e2d466944586d150ed6ceab00cd5bb5a5554f0b60b9ef1f3","projectsAggregate":{"aggregate":{"count":1}},"roundId":"28","status":"REJECTED","statusSnapshots":[{"status":"PENDING","updatedAt":"2025-03-18T18:48:15.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"30929823"},{"status":"REJECTED","updatedAt":"2025-04-01T13:15:37.000Z","updatedAtBlock":"31612579"}],"statusUpdatedAtBlock":32218498,"tags":["allo-v2"],"timestamp":"2025-03-18T18:48:15+00:00","totalAmountDonatedInUsd":0,"totalDonationsCount":0,"uniqueDonorsCount":0},{"anchorAddress":"0x581Ee457b3769E6c336DECCF64DbF5120787466B","applicationsPayouts":[],"chainId":42220,"createdAtBlock":31050574,"createdByAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","distributionTransaction":"0xa27ceea0fde0f590a94a5913bee9e4f27d2507ee914c94d49bf829a5ad0adcac","donations":[{"amount":1000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":276792168440400800,"amountInUsd":0.27687,"id":"0x05c59268723e390fdd205313c84bd9a7a522628781aed3b0bb90eb33116ec9ea","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0x4D5B28d08e8c00e041053b0dc584e00e6997Daa3","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-08T04:31:17+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0xa3dd389ddeac24b0a99b7ccc9bfd6640249e99f33463b08bd4b1cc400b622488"},{"amount":4000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":1088368938072831200,"amountInUsd":1.08597,"id":"0x26288954ad330ee8711d47df2f19860fb7b1408c8e4fcae696c58f8df969f605","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0x26AaA395CC85032976ECf986c9C30d8fB7485f2f","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-09T11:52:10+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x3c2fc8891418b530a011b254d9856261dbe59c80ddae8c4774fc32afa1379a98"},{"amount":2000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":572581212345583900,"amountInUsd":0.5731,"id":"0x0a43da9a141a63d70516e5cdaf4b847891d406990866f726f654f400a4b70b86","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0xFC9B4F407dCcbf8d009e8691EEd0053828DF631F","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-11T06:37:29+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x1fe9a43b7dd232bda477f94ee71403c905f01dbe8dcd37043fb4f464032529c6"},{"amount":1000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":1000000000000000000,"amountInUsd":1.00024,"id":"0xc33e5241d3fd73e5a37a5b0fbaeecadb29aa01322fab8e79d2a454a01db99dd5","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0xB2206f941A5206B55BFA33E665687523A8bcEd80","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-14T13:51:51+00:00","tokenAddress":"0x4F604735c1cF31399C6E711D5962b2B3E0225AD3","transactionHash":"0x7e3ad5d0561bdcf1b3e370f209dfa26a01540febb6cb285412b8376e8b084f57"},{"amount":500000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":148590766848194100,"amountInUsd":0.14854,"id":"0xa1a99415b6d5f68dcd317ccb84541d4e054177469fff32e03a75c30ad3f2c587","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0x59041d70deAEfe849A48E77e0b273DdD072eA9e4","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-15T11:41:25+00:00","tokenAddress":"0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE","transactionHash":"0x0e772f5238340702b805da16a8d268fc6a4042a77c348c1335d4071060f093fa"},{"amount":2000000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":2000000000000000000,"amountInUsd":1.99937,"id":"0x8b720bfdb480c81d64026a71c692b28f15be3232df1c0cfc5ffd24bf47ee7f1c","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddress":"0xd9e744b474efa7a09F76baf24D3322e367DB85F6","donorAddress":"0x31cd90C2788f3e390d2Bb72871f5aD3F1a4B22a1","chainId":42220,"timestamp":"2025-04-15T11:52:02+00:00","tokenAddress":"0x4F604735c1cF31399C6E711D5962b2B3E0225AD3","transactionHash":"0xc8f1406b107da213063b782b2e7686f308c665524824a2386801ad7c9f7771b3"},{"amount":3500000000000000000,"amountInRoundMatchToken":994384505844638200,"amountInUsd":0.99417,"id":"0x4a5c6a05191fba0cff846fd4c024a38f38f07c122f69909ff97531b481bc592c","projectId":"0x679eb72b7da72b6129c1bb59a5b3345d9dad0dfc459e9fae5e699196694dba84","recipientAddr

Talented young scientists often leave their home countries in search of better opportunities, leading to a loss of valuable expertise that could have been harnessed for local development. Additionally, the rise of the attention economy has made it difficult for young people to engage deeply with scientific research, as they are constantly exposed to fast-paced, surface-level content that does not encourage critical thinking or long-term academic involvement. Without a clear pathway for engagement, young researchers miss out on opportunities to contribute meaningfully to scientific progress, both locally and globally.\n\nSolution\nDeSci Youths - Dewellpunk Chapter is a platform designed to nurture and empower the next generation of citizen scientists by connecting them with Decentralized Science (DeSci) initiatives. Our approach is threefold:\n\nShowcasing DeSci Projects: We will curate and highlight various DeSci initiatives to educate students on how web3 technologies can revolutionize scientific collaboration and funding.\n\nOnboarding Space: Through interactive workshops, online resources, and mentorship programs, we will provide students with a structured way to explore and participate in DeSci.\n\nCampus Tours in African Universities: By visiting campuses and hosting talks, hackathons, and networking events, we will introduce students to DeSci and create pathways for them to engage with decentralized scientific research and funding models.\n\nOur roadmap and timeline is categorized by 4 phases and we are still on our first 2 phases namely, \nPhase 1: Research & Community Building (Months 1-9)\nPhase 2: Content Development & Awareness Campaign (Months 7-12)\nOur last phases breakout will precede later on namely,\n Phase 3: Campus Tours & Onboarding \nPhase 4: Scaling & Sustained Engagement","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"DeSci is about democratizing access to scientific knowledge, funding, and collaboration.

Amid this governance failure, new models like Network States and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have emerged as experimental alternatives, yet their legitimacy, functionality, and scalability remain under-explored, especially in connection to scientific governance and knowledge production.\nSolution\n My project is a transdisciplinary, doctoral-level research initiative that seeks to explore and clarify whether blockchain-enabled Network States can serve as viable models of decentralized global governance. Grounded in global studies and using a decolonial lens, this project investigates how these structures—enabled by smart contracts, decentralized finance, and DAO-based coordination—can reshape how we govern science, identity, territory, and collective action beyond the state.\nThe research contributes to the DeSci movement by producing:\nConceptual clarity on decentralized governance models for science.\nCase study analyses of emergent Network States (e.g., GitcoinDAO, Nation3, Pangea, Praxis, Etc).\nOpen-access publication of research tiers via decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave).\nInterviews with DAO and Network State builders to identify real-world barriers and strategies.\n\n\nRoadmap & Timeline\nPhase 1: Conceptual Framework and Chapter Completion (March–May 2025)\nFinalization of theoretical chapters: Polycrisis, Blockchain Governance, Network States.\nIntegration of key literature (Castells, Srinivasan, Bauwens, Biermann, De Filippi, Ostrom).\n\n\n Phase 2: Fieldwork and Data Collection (April–May 2025)\nSemi-structured interviews with key figures from Draper Nation, Satoshi Island, Praxis, and Prospera.\nParticipant observation during DAO governance events (e.g., Ipe City DAO Brazil).\n\n\n Phase 3: Data Analysis and Empirical Interpretation (June–August 2025)\nThematic coding of interviews.\nComparative analysis of governance mechanisms, legitimacy, scalability, and community engagement.\n\n\n Phase 4: Synthesis and Dissemination (Sept 2025–March 2026)\nDrafting and peer review of final chapters.\nOpen-source publication of dissertation and research papers on-chain.\nPublic workshops or DAO-hosted governance roundtables to discuss findings.\n\n\n April 2026: Final Submission and Public Release\nSubmission of dissertation to Humboldt University and USAL.\nOn-chain documentation of final insights, milestones, and contributions.\n","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"My project directly supports the mission of DeSci by advancing the conceptual and empirical understanding of decentralized governance systems that underpin the future of open, transparent, and community-driven science. While many DeSci initiatives focus on specific infrastructure (e.g., funding, publishing, or peer review), this research investigates the governance layer that enables sustainable, legitimate, and scalable coordination across DeSci ecosystems.\nSpecifically, it contributes to DeSci’s goals in the following ways:\n 1. Governance as Public Infrastructure\n By analyzing Network States and DAOs as governance primitives for science, my project helps clarify how decentralized systems can coordinate research funding, knowledge validation, and data stewardship—core challenges in DeSci. This aligns with DeSci’s mission to create bottom-up, community-governed models that go beyond the limitations of academia, venture science, or centralized platforms.\n2. Scientific Legitimacy in Web3 Contexts\n Drawing from the fields of global governance, political economy, and decentralized systems, the project evaluates how DAOs can produce legitimate, inclusive, and trustable mechanisms for conducting and funding science. This helps address a key concern in DeSci: how to build and scale scientific communities without centralized gatekeeping.\n3. Bridging Theory and Practice\n The research is not just theoretical—it engages directly with real-world DeSci actors such as GitcoinDAO, Praxis, and Nation3, offering grounded analysis of their governance strategies. Insights are shared back with the community through open-access publications, conference presentations, and on-chain documentation, thus enriching the DeSci knowledge commons.\n 4. Education and Conceptual Innovation\n As a bi-national doctoral project rooted in Global Studies, the work introduces DeSci to broader academic and policy audiences. It brings DeSci into dialogue with global governance theory, platform cooperativism, and digital sovereignty debates—supporting the educational mission of the movement to redefine science as a planetary public good.\n","hidden":false,"question":"How does your project support the mission or goals of DeSci?","questionId":7},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Funds from the Gitcoin Grants program will directly support the empirical phase of my doctoral research on Network States and decentralized governance models.

It is within this context that our project seeks to intervene, aiming to weave a\ntapestry of knowledge and empowerment for rural women groups who stand at the\nintersection of these challenges.\nThe importance of addressing this issue cannot be overstated. Recent data indicates that over\n70% of rural women in developing countries are engaged in agricultural work yet remain\ndisproportionately affected by poverty. This economic vulnerability is exacerbated by a lack of\naccess to digital savings tools and financial literacy, particularly in the realm of emerging\ntechnologies such as cryptocurrency. The gap in crypto literacy not only sidelines these women\nfrom participating in modern financial ecosystems but also hinders their ability to secure their\neconomic future and contribute to the resilience of their communities.\nEnvironmental degradation further compounds these challenges. Unsustainable farming\npractices have led to soil depletion, water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity—critical issues that\nthreaten food security for these communities. With agriculture being both a victim and a\ncontributor to environmental degradation, there is an urgent need for sustainable solutions\nthat can break this cycle.\nOur project targets rural women groups who are often the backbone of agricultural\nproductivity yet face systemic barriers that limit their potential. By focusing on this\npopulation, we aim to address the root causes of food insecurity and environmental\ndegradation through education on sustainable agriculturetechniques and digital financial\nliteracy. The ripple effects of empowering these women with knowledge and tools extend far\nbeyond individual gains; they have the potential to transform entire communities.\nThe stakes are high, and the need is urgent. As we stand at the crossroads of technological\nadvancement and environmental sustainability, our project offers a beacon of hope for rural\nwomen caught in the throes of poverty and food insecurity. Through our intervention, we aim\nto not only alleviate immediate hardships but also lay the groundwork for a future where\nthese women are active participants in shaping a more resilient and equitable world.\nIn conclusion, our project is not just an initiative; it's a lifeline for those who have been left\nbehind in the digital age and bear the brunt of environmental degradation. By addressing\ncrypto literacy, poverty, environmental degradation, and food insecurity in tandem, we can\nunlock a new horizon of possibilities for rural women groups, fostering an environment where\nsustainable agriculture thrives alongside economic empowerment. This is more than an\ninvestment in individuals; it's an investment in the very fabric of rural communities that form\nthe backbone of our agricultural systems\n\nOur primary goal is to empower over 5000 farmers, including the establishment of 100 women\nsaving groups, within a 24-month period. This will be achieved through comprehensive\ntraining programs focused on sustainable agriculture practices and financial literacy,\nspecifically in the realm of digital savings tools and cryptocurrency. By equipping these\nfarmers and women groups with the necessary skills and knowledge, we aim to enhance food\nsecurity, promote environmental sustainability, and foster economic empowerment within\nrural communities.\nObjectives:\nTrain at least 5000 farmers in sustainable agriculture techniques such as crop rotation,\norganic farming, and water-efficient irrigation methods to improve soil health and\nincrease crop resilience.\nEstablish 100 women saving groups that are educated in financial literacy with a focus on\ndigital savings tools and cryptocurrency, enabling them to secure their economic future.\nDevelop and distribute educational materials tailored to the local context that emphasize\nthe importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management practices.\nCreate model farms that showcase sustainable agricultural practices in action, serving as\nlearning sites for other farmers in the community.\nConduct pre-and post-season planning workshops for farmers to enhance their\nagricultural practices, increase crop yields, and improve overall farm sustainabilityConduct comprehensive survey to assess needs of\nfarmers and women saving groups Completion of survey report 1 month\nOrganize community events for knowledge\nsharing on sustainable agriculture and financial\nliteracy\nSuccessful event execution 2 months\nLaunch media campaign to raise awareness\nabout sustainable farming practices and women\nsaving groups\nMedia coverage and increased\ncommunity engagement 3 months\nReach out to rural farmers through agricultural\nextension officers for on-the-ground support\nEngagement with farmers for\nguidance on sustainable\npractices\n4 months\nEstablish partnerships with local women's groups\nfor the formation of saving groups\nFormation of at least 50 women\nsaving groups 5 months\nDevelop and distribute educational materials\ntailored to the local context\nDistribution of materials to\ntarget audience 6 months\nCreate model farms showcasing sustainable\nagricultural practices in action\nEstablishment of model farms\ndemonstrating best practices 7 months\nConduct pre-and post-season planning\nworkshops for farmers\nCompletion of workshops\nenhancing agricultural\nproductivity\n8 months\nThe timeline above outlines key activities, corresponding milestones, and their estimated\ntimelines for the project implementation. These activities are crucial in achieving our\nobjectives of empowering rural farmers and women saving groups with knowledge and tools\nfor sustainable agriculture practices, financial literacy, and environmental conservation\nefforts. By adhering tothe outlined timeline and milestones, we aim to make significant\nprogress within the first 8 months of the project. From conducting surveys to establishing\nmodel farms and conducting workshops, each activity plays a vital role in advancing our\nmission of fostering resilience and empowerment within rural communities.

Rampant deforestation and wetland destruction have led to irreversible damage, impacting the livelihoods of local\n\ncommunities. Our proposed solution aims to restore the natural landscapes through community awareness campaigns and large-scale tree planting efforts. By addressing the lack of awareness and engaging communities in restoration efforts, we can\n\ncreate a sustainable shift towards conservation practices.\n\nOur project's goals include planting 1 million native trees, rehabilitating 100 hectares of wetlands, and increasing environmental conservation awareness among 80% of the local population. We are committed to reversing the tide of environmental degradation in Tororo and fostering a culture of conservation for generations to come.\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA’s wide range of programs provide support in some of the poorest and most underprivileged communities in Uganda, East Africa. We work with wetlands, peatlands and ecosystem restoration to help address climate change; we also plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and communities to fight food insecurity, increase plantations and provide forest cover.\n\nBesides agroforestry/permaculture, plastic wastes and management and energy conservation, AYOWECCA UGANDA also trains young adolescent girls on how to make reusable sanitary towels and provides scholastic materials to the most vulnerable to attend and access education and creates awareness among communities to actively empower women and children.\n\nSince AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges.\n\n![Treenueserybed](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot_20240618-094505-768x569.jpg)\n\nIn 2025 our journey is to plant 50000 fruit trees and train 5000 rural farmers in Tororo District\n\nUpdate\n1213 rural farmers and community members trained on regenerative/smart agricultural methods, onboarded into web3, sensitized and educated on the impacts of climate climate change\n\n34,000+ fruit trees have been planted in 105 schools and 73 health centers\n\n8 wetlands have been restored\n\n683 women and girls are undertaking the skills training on both tailoring and hairdressing\n\n3,000+ children receive scholastic materials every year\n\n1067 girls and women have been trained on making reusable sanitary towels\n\nWe also bought tailoring, catering and salon services to train rural girls and women who have dropped out of school and to empower them with hands-on skills to be economically empowered.\n\n![skilling girls](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPEG_20240703_133651_8197707277131995110-768x432.jpg)\n\nProject Objectives\nObjective 1\n\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\n\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\n\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\n\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\n\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n\nObjective 2\n\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\n\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n\nObjective 3\n\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\n\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n\nObjective 4\n\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\n\nWe welcome anyone or any organizations willing to work with us to make this world a better place for everyone as partners and collaborators.\n\n![womenempowerment](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_20240604_162002_143-768x576.jpg)\n\nPartnerships\n\nWe are so grateful for our continued collaboration and partnership with The Solar Foundation in the past years, financing our office with solar power, security fencing and solar lights at our greenhouse/nursery bed and powering 206 families with solar lanterns (women and vulnerable families).\n\nWe are also collaborating with Silvi Protocol to track the growth of fruit trees we have planted from potting at the nursery bed, to planting through maturity when they bear fruits through dMRV data.\n\n![silviprotocolprove](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Silvi-GG20.jpg)\n\nConclusion\nThe environmental crisis in Eastern Uganda presents a pressing need for action to reverse the tide of degradation and safeguard the region's natural heritage. Our proposed solution, centered on community awareness campaigns and large-\n\nscale tree planting efforts, addresses the root causes of environmental degradation while fostering a culture of conservation.\n\nThe significance of this project extends beyond local impact, as it contributes to global concerns such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Absolute poverty and water scarcity, education and technology literacy\n\nThe impact of our project will be transformative, leading to improved biodiversity, enhanced community resilience against climate change impacts, and a shift towards sustainable land use practices. By implementing a comprehensive framework for\n\nevaluation and planning for future funding through eco-tourism initiatives and international partnerships, we are dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our conservation efforts in Tororo Eastern Uganda and economic empowerment for women and rural farmers.\n\n![communitytreeplantingevent](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8.png)\n\n\n","lastUpdated":0,"projectGithub":"AYOWECCA-UGANDA","projectTwitter":"ayowecca_uganda"},"recipient":"0xE024C19924e867B46049c709Ad1239Fb3cDcE255"}},"metadataCid":"bafkreib4efzomrdg6ps37dncup7hc56otuhmp77xkkhfb2fviswt3vue6m","projects":[{"name":"Ayowecca

UGANDA is a community led NGO in Tororo, East Uganda. At AYOWECCA UGANDA, we train rural farmers on regenerative agricultural methods/smart agriculture that are environmentally sustainable, map agricultural practices in carbon credits, promote agroforestry and permaculture where farmers can plant fruit trees besides growing food or cash crops and learn how to make organic manure and pesticides.\n\nWe also have a charity which works in our local communities to mobilize climate change awareness and education, crypto education, tree planting and wetlands and peatland restoration campaigns, workshops, storytelling, giving seeds to farmers, etc.\n\n![policeofficersonrestoration](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20221111_095836_433-1-1536x1152.jpg)\n\nFor GG23, we request that with your support, we can create a thriving community training/skilling center and demonstration farm to help our community adapt to the escalating impacts of climate change. We seek to build climate resilience for rural, low-income communities with a focus on women, families and youth. Your support will also help us plant more fruit trees in schools, health centers and churches. Our training space is small and we would like to get a bigger place in order to help more people, and also to be able to pay additional facilitators. Our vision is that by next year, many of our Supporters can visit our farm and recommend interns for our organization.\n\nAt Ayowecca Uganda, we believe the time to act is now to safeguard not only the natural heritage of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, but also the health, prosperity, and resilience of its communities in the frontlines affected by the climate crisis. We invite you to join us in making a difference to the lives of those who really need it.\n\n![plantingfruittrees](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20221111_111926_106-1536x1152.jpg)\n\nAbout\nIn the heart of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, a crisis of environmental degradation threatens the region's biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Rampant deforestation and wetland destruction have led to irreversible damage, impacting the livelihoods of local\n\ncommunities. Our proposed solution aims to restore the natural landscapes through community awareness campaigns and large-scale tree planting efforts. By addressing the lack of awareness and engaging communities in restoration efforts, we can\n\ncreate a sustainable shift towards conservation practices.\n\nOur project's goals include planting 1 million native trees, rehabilitating 100 hectares of wetlands, and increasing environmental conservation awareness among 80% of the local population. We are committed to reversing the tide of environmental degradation in Tororo and fostering a culture of conservation for generations to come.\n\nAYOWECCA UGANDA’s wide range of programs provide support in some of the poorest and most underprivileged communities in Uganda, East Africa. We work with wetlands, peatlands and ecosystem restoration to help address climate change; we also plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and communities to fight food insecurity, increase plantations and provide forest cover.\n\nBesides agroforestry/permaculture, plastic wastes and management and energy conservation, AYOWECCA UGANDA also trains young adolescent girls on how to make reusable sanitary towels and provides scholastic materials to the most vulnerable to attend and access education and creates awareness among communities to actively empower women and children.\n\nSince AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges.\n\n![Treenueserybed](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot_20240618-094505-768x569.jpg)\n\nIn 2025 our journey is to plant 50000 fruit trees and train 5000 rural farmers in Tororo District\n\nUpdate\n1213 rural farmers and community members trained on regenerative/smart agricultural methods, onboarded into web3, sensitized and educated on the impacts of climate climate change\n\n34,000+ fruit trees have been planted in 105 schools and 73 health centers\n\n8 wetlands have been restored\n\n683 women and girls are undertaking the skills training on both tailoring and hairdressing\n\n3,000+ children receive scholastic materials every year\n\n1067 girls and women have been trained on making reusable sanitary towels\n\nWe also bought tailoring, catering and salon services to train rural girls and women who have dropped out of school and to empower them with hands-on skills to be economically empowered.\n\n![skilling girls](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPEG_20240703_133651_8197707277131995110-768x432.jpg)\n\nProject Objectives\nObjective 1\n\nSensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture.\n\nForm groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.\n\nEnhance the capacity of 1,000 households in 50 groups to raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms.\n\nEstablish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply schools, health centers and across Tororo District.\n\nTrain rural farmers on regenerative agricultural practices including making organic manure and pesticides.\n\nObjective 2\n\nProcure training materials for agroforestry/permaculture demonstrations.\n\nEstablish agroforestry seedlings/permaculture sites per Sub County.\n\nObjective 3\n\nDistribute seedlings to their individual members/community members.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting by their members.\n\nIntercrop established plots with Agricultural crops.\n\nObjective 4\n\nDistribute seedlings to schools, health centers, churches and to the communities.\n\nSupervise and monitor planting of trees in schools, health centers and churches.\n\nWe welcome anyone or any organizations willing to work with us to make this world a better place for everyone as partners and collaborators.\n\n![womenempowerment](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_20240604_162002_143-768x576.jpg)\n\nPartnerships\n\nWe are so grateful for our continued collaboration and partnership with The Solar Foundation in the past years, financing our office with solar power, security fencing and solar lights at our greenhouse/nursery bed and powering 206 families with solar lanterns (women and vulnerable families).\n\nWe are also collaborating with Silvi Protocol to track the growth of fruit trees we have planted from potting at the nursery bed, to planting through maturity when they bear fruits through dMRV data.\n\n![silviprotocolprove](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ayowecca-Silvi-GG20.jpg)\n\nConclusion\nThe environmental crisis in Eastern Uganda presents a pressing need for action to reverse the tide of degradation and safeguard the region's natural heritage. Our proposed solution, centered on community awareness campaigns and large-\n\nscale tree planting efforts, addresses the root causes of environmental degradation while fostering a culture of conservation.\n\nThe significance of this project extends beyond local impact, as it contributes to global concerns such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Absolute poverty and water scarcity, education and technology literacy\n\nThe impact of our project will be transformative, leading to improved biodiversity, enhanced community resilience against climate change impacts, and a shift towards sustainable land use practices. By implementing a comprehensive framework for\n\nevaluation and planning for future funding through eco-tourism initiatives and international partnerships, we are dedicated to ensuring the long-term

This issue  stems from the false belief that women are just small men (aka. Bikini Medicine) and was deepened in the 1970s when women of reproductive age were systematically excluded from clinical trials.This resulted in men being used as the baseline for health research and treatments for the majority of Western Medicine.  Such exclusion created an ongoing deficit in female-specific health data, especially outside reproductive health, where  80% of MedTech funding is concentrated. This underfunding and lack of targeted research have left many aspects of women’s health underserved. \n\nOur aim is to provide researchers with the first female-specific data pools for female-biased disorders while providing women the ability to vote on their healthcare for the first time in history through tokenizing the data. We will do this by building the first female-only data union (aka. data lake or data pool) which collects, aggregates, and monetizes anonymized women’s health data while ensuring privacy through zero-knowledge compute methods. Our solution provides researchers cost-effective aquisition of ongoing metrics from regions traditionally left out of the research equation, as well as cost-effective aquisition of focus group and trial participants (should our participants opt in in their profiles).\n\nOur MVP begins alpha testing in April!","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Medical data ownership is at the fore of the concerns DeSci addresses.

This adversely impacts diagnosis and treatment outcomes, reducing social productivity and increasing social costs. Asterisk is working to backfill 500 years of missing data by building a decentralized platform ecosystem that confronts these issues.

Accessing and understanding the deep, nuanced concepts requires more than just text processing; it demands familiarity with specific experimental contexts, biological pathways, and the latest validated findings, which generic models typically lack.\n\nThe core limitation arises because standard AI is not designed to effectively interact with or interpret the wealth of structured information stored in specialized biological databases crucial to longevity research (such as GenAge, DrugAge, or genomic repositories). These databases contain vital data on genes, compounds, lifespans, and clinical trials. Without the ability to intelligently query, integrate, and reason over this structured data alongside unstructured text from research papers, AI fails to provide the comprehensive, accurate, and context-aware insights needed by researchers, citizen scientists, and enthusiasts in the field.\n\nSolution\n\nLongevity Genie directly tackles these challenges by developing advanced, open-source AI tools using techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and specialized semantic search optimized for scientific content. Our approach prioritizes connecting AI directly to reliable primary sources – both research literature and curated biological databases – ensuring the information is accurate, current, and scientifically grounded.\n\nWe are actively implementing a modular, multi-agent architecture, recognizing its significant advantages. By creating multiple specialized agents – each an expert on a specific database (like GenAge) or analytical task (like gene set analysis) – we achieve greater accuracy and efficiency for targeted inquiries. Furthermore, this modularity allows higher-level orchestrator agents to integrate findings from various specialized agents, enabling complex analyses and comprehensive summaries across diverse data sources. This structure, supported by frameworks like just-agents, offers immense flexibility for building custom workflows and integrating tools easily.\n\nAs a key part of our planned development and future strategy, we are designing and releasing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These specialized servers will act as standardized, efficient interfaces to supply structured, up-to-date context directly from various longevity databases. The importance of MCP lies in its framework-agnostic design, allowing any compatible AI agent framework (not just our own) to readily access this crucial biological data. Implementing MCP will significantly boost the analytical power and domain awareness of interconnected agents as our ecosystem evolves.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nPhase 1, Q2 2025 - Q3 2025: \nRefine prompts and refactor the code to support newly added models to achieve the level of output quality on par with proprietary models \nAdd Longevity MCP servers and promote their usage by agent systems\nRefresh scientific papers datasets, and index scientific papers with novel advanced embeddings (Jina v3)\nPhase 2 (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026) \nRefine RAG search by using several agents and reranker model working together\nCreate serializable multimodal agents to enhance RAG results with textual transcription of scientific papers figures.\nBring up the telegram bot as an alternative interface.","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Longevity Genie aligns strongly with several core principles and goals of the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement:\nOpenness and Accessibility: At its heart, Longevity Genie is committed to being open-source. Our core frameworks (just-agents, just-semantic-search), specialized agents, and associated datasets are publicly available (e.g., via GitHub and Hugging Face). This directly supports the DeSci goal of removing barriers and paywalls, making advanced scientific tools and data freely accessible to anyone, anywhere.\n\n\nDemocratization of Science: A primary objective is to make complex scientific fields like aging biology understandable and usable for a broader audience, including citizen scientists, tech enthusiasts, and amateur researchers. By providing tools that simplify access to and interpretation of sophisticated research and databases, we empower individuals outside traditional academic institutions to participate in learning, exploration, and potentially even discovery, aligning perfectly with DeSci's aim to widen participation.\n\n\nTransparency and Verifiability: Our emphasis on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and directly querying high-quality research papers and biological databases enhances transparency. Instead of opaque outputs, our tools aim to provide insights grounded in specific, identifiable sources. This focus on source data aligns with the DeSci principle of making scientific claims more verifiable and processes more transparent.\n\n\nInteroperability and Collaboration: The development of a modular, multi-agent architecture and especially the framework-agnostic Model Context Protocol (MCP) promotes interoperability. By creating reusable components and standardized ways for AI agents to access specialized scientific context, we facilitate collaboration. Other researchers or DeSci projects can potentially integrate our tools or adopt MCP, fostering a more interconnected and collaborative scientific ecosystem, rather than building isolated silos.","hidden":false,"question":"How does your project support the mission or goals of DeSci?","questionId":7},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"We applied for computational grants to Nebius and Google.

Traditional models are plagued by:\n\n* Inefficient, bureaucratic grant processes  \n* Short-term thinking that stifles innovative research  \n* Valuable research locked behind expensive paywalls  \n* Researchers spending more time seeking funding than conducting science\n\n## **Solution**  \nWe're building science funding as a \"hyperstructure\" – a crypto-economic protocol that runs forever without maintenance, cannot be stopped, and creates value for all participants.\n\nThis means: scientists receive continuous support rather than one-off grants.\n\nCCGF operates on two simple principles:\n\n* **Community-driven selection via conviction voting:** Projects are selected for support based on sustained community conviction.  \n* **Fair distribution:** Resources flow to projects proportionally to their community support, using StreamingQF to balance large and small backers.\n\nWhen funded projects succeed, they voluntarily contribute back to the ecosystem through revenue sharing, token contributions, and resource exchange. This feedback loop expands the treasury, enabling continuous funding for new research.\n\n## **Roadmap & timelines**  \nNear-term milestones for the next 3-6 months are planned as follows:\n\n1. Get 10 projects applying for the continuous funding via CCGF.  \n2. Establish robust operations and governance on Gardens.  \n3.

(Months)","questionId":5},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"*Problem Statement*: Legal research is plagued by multiple inefficiencies resulting from siloed annotations. The absence of transparent and reliable incentives for sharing notes results in gridlocked collaboration and unnecessary duplication. On the other hand, the absence of high-quality, ethically sourced, human-annotated datasets impedes the development of reliable, domain-specific language models for the legal field. Current AI models often rely on unethically sourced data (or noisy and synthetic data parsed from documents), leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations, making them unsuitable for legal applications. There is an urgent need for a system that recognizes and rewards the semantic labor of legal researchers while providing high-quality datasets for AI training, evaluation and benchmarking. \n\n*Solution*: Hyvmind offers an elegant solution to this problem by creating a reward channel which turns siloed legal annotations into community-owned vector databases.  \n\n*Roadmap*: Presently, the project is in the community development phase. The immediate goal is to solidify institutional partnerships (with civil society organisations, law colleges, other legal-tech projects) by positioning Hyvmind as a tamper-proof and community-owned semantic data layer for legal research.   \n\nThe concrete goals over the next year are as follows: \n- July 2025: launch a 'digital internship pilot' with partner organisations \n- Aug 2025: build an initial cohort of law students (20-50) around a particular working group (say 'Indian banking law) through blockchain-based rewards (e.g. Push Points) and/or poaps\n- Oct 2025: conduct at least 3 workshops and seminars to onboard fresh cohorts and deepen institutional partnerships\n- Nov 2025: make datasets available through public repos for wider consultation and use; another round of internships and onboarding \n- Dec 2025: launch beta version with a minimal frontend and user profiles (with rewards, reputation points and annotation marketplace)\n- Feb 2026:  feedback, review, finalisation of tokenomics\n - May 2026: launch of v1 app for broader public use","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"- *Digital Public Infrastructure*: there will be two layers to Hyvmind, an openly accessible layer for black letter law (no weights), and a royalty-embedded layer for interpretations/notes (weighted) [see 'annotation value chains' in the whitepaper for details]\n- *Ethically Sourced Datasets*: each 'location' (say art. 14 of the Indian Constitution) will be owned and controlled by its own sub-DAO [see 'location contracts' in the whitepaper for details]\n- *Professional Recognition*: rewards, reputations and annotation weights will combine to form a reliable metric for professional contribution (outside traditional metrics such as cases won, publications etc.) \n- *Scientific Peer-Production*: the open-source layer of black letter law will be thoroughly vetted by peers, embedding peer review and co-production into the architecture.

First, we showcased a figure on a poster at ARDD (Aging Research and Drug Development), a major aging conference in Copenhagen ([agingpharma.org](https://agingpharma.org/)). Next, we gave a talk at Zelar City in Berlin ([zelar.city](https://www.zelar.city/)), pitching GlucoseDAO and the perks of glucose tracking. Both events doubled as networking hubs to snag supporters.  \nAt Zelar, we also started a trial with 7 non-diabetic volunteers who funded their own CGM sensors to monitor blood sugar swings. We’re still crunching the data, alongside smartwatch metrics they shared. It’s a small batch, but it’s live testing in action.\n\n**Proof of Work:**  \nCheck the talk: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=uerUE6OOgPI)\n\n---\n\n## Creating the Open-Source Dataset and Codebase\n\nWe promised open-source data, so we started with my personal CGM dataset, cleaned it up, and shipped it. Here’s what’s live:  \n- **Demo App**: Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces at [GlucoseDAO Demo App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GlucoseDao/glucosedao) — first peek at the GlucoseDAO app.\n- **Dataset**: Processed and open at [Glucose Processed Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Livia-Zaharia/glucose_processed) — powers the model and the ARDD 2024 figure.\n- **Model**: Gluformer model at [Gluformer Model](https://huggingface.co/Livia-Zaharia/gluformer_models) — drives the app’s first version and the ARDD figure.\n- **Code**: All repositories are at the [Github organization](https://github.com/GlucoseDAO) for anyone who wants to dig in.\n\n**Proof of Work:**  \nAll hosted here: [Hugging Face - GlucoseDAO](https://huggingface.co/GlucoseDao)\n\n---\n\n## Scientific Advisory Board and Collaborations\n\nWe’ve secured a robust scientific advisory board and established key collaborations to advance this project.\n\n### Scientific Advisory Board:\n- **Irina Gaynanova** (University of Michigan, Biostatistics)\n- **Prof. Georg Fullen** (Rostock University)\n- **Renat Sergazinov** (GlucoBench author)\n- **Virgil Ilian** (AI advisor)\n\nThe first two have authored widely recognized resources, including:\n- [Awesome-CGM](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM): A comprehensive repository of all publicly available continuous glucose monitoring datasets.\n- [GlucoBench](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench): A leading benchmarking framework for glucose prediction models, published as a peer-reviewed paper and available as open-source code.\n- [Gluformer](https://github.com/mrsergazinov/gluformer): A state-of-the-art transformer model for glucose forecasting, also published in a peer-reviewed paper and implemented in our work.\n\n### Collaborations:\nWe’re working with the open-source ecosystem at [Longevity Genie](https://longevity-genie.info/), integrating their libraries to streamline development.\n\n---\n\n## Chatbot Development\n\nWe’re developing a chatbot to enhance user access to glucose-related information and promote GlucoseDAO’s mission. Key features include:\n- **Project Inquiries**: Users can ask about GlucoseDAO directly, eliminating the need to scout websites.\n- **Semantic Search**: Extracts insights from indexed scientific papers on glucose management, addressing common user questions like “What’s the latest research?” or “How does Gluformer model work?”\n- **General Q&A**: Answers questions on diabetes, glucose management, and its impacts.\n\n### What Sets It Apart:\nUnlike standard LLMs with generic responses, this chatbot taps into niche, unindexed, or highly specific data, simplifying access to cutting-edge information. For users, it streamlines research; for our team, it aligns with our open-source ethos, spreading knowledge while advancing our cause.\n\n### Development Details:\n- Fully open-sourced at [GitHub - Just-Chat](https://github.com/GlucoseDAO/just-chat), built using the Just-Chat library.\n- We’re currently in the critical testing phase, refining functionality, adding additional papers, tuning prompts, and ensuring stability to prevent crashes.\n\n**Proof of work:**  \n[GlucoseDAO Website](https://glucosedao.org/)\n\n---\n\n# MILESTONES\n\n### Sugar-sugar Prediction Game  \n**Apr 4, 2025 - Jun 30, 2025**  \nDevelopment of a glucose prediction game. Why? Because, at least for the moment, no one knows what is the gold standard in glucose prediction. We know how accurate a model is statistically, however, there is no reference for actual use. How good is a prediction model in comparison to a human, asked to estimate how glucose will go in the next hour? Because that is what we have been doing as diabetics for all our lives. And because we have to set a standard.  \nHow would we know we are doing something that actually helps them? What exactly is it though?  \nIt will be a simple online game — users are given the graph of 8 hours before and asked to predict what will happen next by drawing the curve for 1 hour. Obviously, the graph they receive will be an extract from a continuous series from my data. We think it will be easy to play and will engage the users, also giving us information and spreading the news about the study. The timeline is longer because it is only a very rough sketch as can be seen on the provided visuals.\n\n---\n\n### Gathering a Community  \n**Mar 24, 2025 - Sep 1, 2025**  \nWe started with this idea, and this is a persistent concept. We hope that more people, especially those who need glucose prediction, will hear about us and spread the word, helping those in need. Of course, we also aim to inform people who aren’t directly involved (like the non-diabetic community) about the importance of tracking their glucose.  \nHowever, this is only milestone 3 because, to reach out, we need things that people will engage with, such as the chatbot and the game. It would be nice to claim everything will be just solved, but we have to take it step by step. Therefore, I will leave the end date as far away since community formation is an ongoing process.\n\n---\n\n### Glucose Prediction - First Version  \n**Apr 2, 2025 - Dec 4, 2025**  \nFor those wondering why this is the least priority: it is because we need to solve all the preceding tasks before we can continue. We want to develop a glucose prediction app for 1 hour into the future. It will allow users to upload CSV files from their CGM and gather a rough sketch of what could happen in the future. However, for that, we need to:\n- Find out the types of data from commercially available Continuous Glucose Monitors.\n- Gather data to train and test models (we still have few participants).\n- For prediction to be accurate to a person, we need to determine the best way to train that model and the minimum amount of data needed.\n- Study how heart rate, sleep, activities, and other factors influence it.\n- Actually implement the software.\n- Spread the word about it.\n- And many other obstacles we still don’t know.\n\nAs such, we plan to have the first sample for the general public by December. The timing is due to the amount of work needed, but also to the back processes involved, such as promoting, networking, and all the previous milestones, which are currently handled by the same team of people.\n","hidden":false,"question":"If this project participated in past DeSci grant rounds, please share any new updates or milestones since the last round.","questionId":10},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Regarding previous work and a bit about it’s history- the project started with an attempt to read my own glucose patterns.

Each person's glucose response is unique, and continuous monitoring of changes is more informative than single-point tests. Comprehensive study and data collection are necessary to understand how these fluctuations affect individuals and how to improve them.\n\n- For people with diabetes, it allows maintaining normal ranges and avoiding hypo and hyperglycemia.\n- For health and longevity seekers, it can help optimize diet, lifestyle, and reduce damage from glucose spikes and risks of prediabetes.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose:\n\n1. *Establish a decentralized open database of blood glucose values* from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices. The data will be contributed by volunteers and may also include relevant health and lifestyle-related variables (diseases, weight, height, etc.).\n2. *Train models to predict blood glucose trends* and fine-tune existing public models on this data. Contribute the model and dataset to [GlucoBench benchmark](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench/).\n3. *Establish a Glucose DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)* which will govern data collection and development and will also work on protocols of sharing glucose data and smart contracts that will allow participants to be rewarded in case of commercial applications.\n\nThis approach aligns with recent research on privacy-preserved blood glucose level cross-prediction using decentralized federated learning. (https://github.com/ChengzhePiao/coldstartbglp)\n\n## Examining the Current Use of Glucose Data\n\nA clear need for a DAO approach is evident. This strategy addresses the prevalent issue of user data being sold without revenue sharing. A DAO structure offers two potential solutions:\n\n### Open-source for Research\n\nA DAO can facilitate an open-source database of anonymized glucose data, promoting transparency and collaborative research while maintaining privacy of contributors. This aligns with the decentralization principle of DAOs, ensuring no single entity has total control over the data.\n\n### Fair profit-sharing for commercial use-cases\n\nFor commercial applications, DAO can develop smart contracts to automate profit-sharing with data contributors to ensure fair compensation.\n\nBy implementing a DAO, the glucose data ecosystem can evolve from its current centralized model to a more transparent, collaborative, and user-centric approach.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis project aims to democratize access to valuable health data and insights, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health and longevity. By supporting this project, you are not only helping people with medical conditions but also paving the way for access to information that could potentially extend or at least improve your lifespan.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n\n### Team Size\n\n- 3\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n- *Underutilized data from increasing CGM adoption*: 463 million people have diabetes worldwide and millions of them already use CGMs for many years. Existing datasets have only dozens of people monitored at short intervals of several months [Renat Sergazinov, et. al, \"GlucoBench: Curated List of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Datasets with Prediction Benchmarks.\" OpenReview, 2023, see also https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM). While acknowledging the endeavor of Irina Gaynanova lab of summarizing existing datasets, we believe that a novel, large longitudinal dataset must be created.\n- *Most existing data are of clinical/academic nature*: While useful for research and development, most existing datasets are usually of academic/clinical nature, have short timespans, have a small number of non-diabetic people, and do not include some important aspects (like data on sensor resets, for example).\n- *Existing models are hard to deploy and use in real-world scenarios and are not user-friendly*: Only a small part of the models is public and most of them are hard to deploy and use on an everyday basis for an average user.

Each person's glucose response is unique, and continuous monitoring of changes is more informative than single-point tests. Comprehensive study and data collection are necessary to understand how these fluctuations affect individuals and how to improve them.\n\n- For people with diabetes, it allows maintaining normal ranges and avoiding hypo and hyperglycemia.\n- For health and longevity seekers, it can help optimize diet, lifestyle, and reduce damage from glucose spikes and risks of prediabetes.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose:\n\n1. *Establish a decentralized open database of blood glucose values* from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices. The data will be contributed by volunteers and may also include relevant health and lifestyle-related variables (diseases, weight, height, etc.).\n2. *Train models to predict blood glucose trends* and fine-tune existing public models on this data. Contribute the model and dataset to [GlucoBench benchmark](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench/).\n3. *Establish a Glucose DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)* which will govern data collection and development and will also work on protocols of sharing glucose data and smart contracts that will allow participants to be rewarded in case of commercial applications.\n\nThis approach aligns with recent research on privacy-preserved blood glucose level cross-prediction using decentralized federated learning. (https://github.com/ChengzhePiao/coldstartbglp)\n\n## Examining the Current Use of Glucose Data\n\nA clear need for a DAO approach is evident. This strategy addresses the prevalent issue of user data being sold without revenue sharing. A DAO structure offers two potential solutions:\n\n### Open-source for Research\n\nA DAO can facilitate an open-source database of anonymized glucose data, promoting transparency and collaborative research while maintaining privacy of contributors. This aligns with the decentralization principle of DAOs, ensuring no single entity has total control over the data.\n\n### Fair profit-sharing for commercial use-cases\n\nFor commercial applications, DAO can develop smart contracts to automate profit-sharing with data contributors to ensure fair compensation.\n\nBy implementing a DAO, the glucose data ecosystem can evolve from its current centralized model to a more transparent, collaborative, and user-centric approach.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis project aims to democratize access to valuable health data and insights, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health and longevity. By supporting this project, you are not only helping people with medical conditions but also paving the way for access to information that could potentially extend or at least improve your lifespan.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n\n### Team Size\n\n- 3\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n- *Underutilized data from increasing CGM adoption*: 463 million people have diabetes worldwide and millions of them already use CGMs for many years. Existing datasets have only dozens of people monitored at short intervals of several months [Renat Sergazinov, et. al, \"GlucoBench: Curated List of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Datasets with Prediction Benchmarks.\" OpenReview, 2023, see also https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM). While acknowledging the endeavor of Irina Gaynanova lab of summarizing existing datasets, we believe that a novel, large longitudinal dataset must be created.\n- *Most existing data are of clinical/academic nature*: While useful for research and development, most existing datasets are usually of academic/clinical nature, have short timespans, have a small number of non-diabetic people, and do not include some important aspects (like data on sensor resets, for example).\n- *Existing models are hard to deploy and use in real-world scenarios and are not user-friendly*: Only a small part of the models is public and most of them are hard to deploy and use on an everyday basis for an average user. What is important for the end-user is that the model pre-trained on public datasets should be fine-tuned on your own data to predict your future values and your risks.\n- *Existing data sharing platforms* (like https://www.tidepool.org/bigdata) sell users' personal information to companies without compensating the data owners. We believe users should be fairly rewarded when their data is sold for commercial purposes. One potential solution is the development of smart contracts by the Glucose DAO.\n\n### Importance\n\nGlucose prediction is crucial for longevity, as both levels and variations impact health.

Researchers waste 116 hours per grant application—time that should fuel discovery, not paperwork. For a single funding council, the collective time scientists spend writing proposals equals 550 full-time researchers working an entire year, despite success rates below 20%. Studies confirm the bitter truth: time invested in grant writing doesn't even improve funding outcomes. The result? Promising research dies on the vine not because it lacks merit, but because our broken system rewards administrative skill over scientific brilliance—systematically suffocating innovation before it can breathe.\n\nSolution\n\nIdeosphere's prediction markets transform scientific speculation into direct research funding, with researchers receiving cash flow through trading activity spread on their prediction markets. Through our robust two-stage validation process—independent verification of milestones with UMA-powered dispute resolution—we ensure integrity while creating powerful incentives: researchers receive continuous funding as market activity grows, while science enthusiasts monetize their expertise by backing promising research early. This revolutionary model means researchers earn more as interest in their work increases, creating a virtuous cycle where scientific progress and financial rewards align perfectly.\n\nRoadmap\n\nPhase 1: Foundation (Q2-Q3 2025)\n\n- Complete MVP development with core prediction market functionality\n- Onboard 3-5 pilot researchers with focused, verifiable hypotheses in supplement efficacy\n- Build initial community of science-oriented traders through targeted outreach\n- Launch beta version with limited markets to test mechanisms and gather feedback\n\nPhase 2: Validation & Expansion (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)\n\n- Refine platform based on beta feedback and optimize user experience\n- Expand researcher onboarding process with streamlined verification procedures\n- Develop partnerships with 1-2 research institutions for credibility and pipe\n\nPhase 3: Growth & Ecosystem Development (Q2-Q4 2026)\n\n- Scale researcher onboarding with verified track record and results\n- Implement community governance for market creation and dispute resolution\n- Develop reputation systems for both researchers and traders","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Ideosphere embodies DeSci's core mission by creating a decentralized funding mechanism that bypasses traditional gatekeepers while aligning scientific progress with market incentives. \n\nOur prediction markets democratize research by allowing anyone to back promising science and potentially profit from correct outcome predictions.

Our science network is building multi modal data integration and shared computational resources to better model solutions for climate adaptation, biodiversity and regeneration strategies.\n\n*Let’s Defeat Moloch!* Today we face the global coordination failure of protecting our life support systems. The planet is one interconnected environmental system, yet our data models are not. This systemic issue has led to a waste of investment into ineffective solutions and a mystified \"sustainable\" asset class that poorly represents the realities of our Earth (Carbon, Biodiversity, SDG;s etc).\n\nWe are creating unified, agreed upon tools and standards to facilitate coordination. This infrastructure empowers the development of advanced predictive environmental models that can compute the complexity of our natural systems. \n\n## ÆRTH is the Kaggle for environmental science, reimagined with blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain enables secure data sharing with clear ownership tracking and usage metrics. This unified standard allows global researchers and ML scientists to compute over previously siloed data, building advanced models through competitions. Governments, NGOs, scientific institutions, and citizens can offer bounties for scenario modeling and solution development, fostering a collaborative ecosystem that accelerates environmental research and innovation.\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nÆRTH is developing a pioneering platform that serves as a science-based standards organisation, offering comprehensive data integration and shared computational resources to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and fragmented environmental research. \n\n\nThis detailed summary outlines ÆRTH's core technical features, strategic advantages, and its role in revolutionising environmental science collaboration.\n\n\n## 1.

(Months)","questionId":5},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"When we first created Just-DNA-Seq, we focused only on full genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES). That’s because popular services like 23andMe and MyHeritage look at only about 0.03% of your DNA. While they do highlight interesting genetic markers, it’s just a tiny slice of the picture. With sequencing costs dropping fast, we saw WGS and WES as a way better option for anyone who wants real insight from their DNA, definitely worth the price difference.\nAt the time, we offered some basic support for 23andMe files through OakVar, but it wasn’t maintained—mainly because many of the markers used in our longevity reports weren’t even included in 23andMe data. We didn’t ignore these on purpose; it just didn’t seem worth focusing on such a limited format.\nBut then, something changed.\n23andMe filed for bankruptcy. Millions of people who had paid to explore their DNA were left without support, feeling abandoned and unsure what to do with their data. Many reached out to platforms like ours, hoping to salvage some value from the files they still had.\nThat moment made us rethink things.\nYes, full genome sequencing is still the better option. But now, helping people make use of their old 23andMe files is not just a feature—it’s a mission. We want to rebuild trust in personal genomics. We want to show people that their data isn’t useless. And maybe, if we can give them something meaningful now, they’ll be open to proper sequencing in the future.\nSo in this round, we’re putting real effort into improving how we support 23andMe users: better annotations, smoother uploads, and more actionable insights—even with limited data.\nThis is not about cutting-edge tools at this point - this is about making personal genomics accessible, transparent, and future-ready, because everyone deserves to learn something real about their genes.\n\n\n🧬 Our Solution\nWe are upgrading Just-DNA-Seq to fully support and re-annotate 23andMe files, giving them new life.\nWhile we’ve always focused on full genome data for deeper insights, we’re now building a dedicated 23andMe track in our platform. This includes:\n✅ Improved SNP Coverage: We’re curating a list of longevity-related genetic variants that match the most common versions of 23andMe arrays.\n✅ Rescue Mode for old Tools: We’re bringing back and upgrading our OakVar-based 23andMe parser, making it easier to upload and analyze old files.\n✅ Longevity-Focused Reports: Even with limited data, users will get simplified, actionable reports about aging-related risks, protective variants, and potential longevity drugs.\n✅ \"Genetics Genie\" Chat Assistant: Our AI-powered assistant will answer questions about users' results in plain language—no genetics degree required.\n✅ Bridge to Full Sequencing: For those who want more, our reports will highlight what's missing and offer guidance for upgrading to full genome analysis in the future.\nIn short, we’re giving millions of “stranded” genetic data files a second chance—while keeping our focus on science, transparency, and personal health empowerment. What isn’t changing is that all analysis happens transparently and locally—no hidden algorithms, no data selling. Just science you can understand and control.\nRoadmap\nMonth 1\nRebuild basic support for 23andMe data files\nRehaul our report layout to account for 23andMe data properly: no more empty sections.\nStart community outreach to better understand user needs\nMonth 2–3\nUpdate the variant annotations for 23andMe data using the latest scientific papers\nHighlight key SNPs related to longevity and health risks\nMake reports clearer and more accessible for interpretation by non-experts\nPropose actionables, where applicable\nImplement the features users requested.\n\n\nMonth 4–6\nTest with real user data and gather feedback\nPolish the interface and reporting format\nShare open-source updates and basic educational materials\n\n\nIf funding allows, we’ll go further—we’re considering adding imputation that wasn’t necessary for WGS data to hint people with what variants they might as well have, based on correlations, to encourage them to validate those by considering full genome sequencing.\n","hidden":false,"question":"Describe your project in a few paragraphs (ideally including a problem statement, solution, roadmap, and timeline for implementation)","questionId":6},{"type":"paragraph","answer":"Just-DNA-Seq embodies Decentralized Science (DeSci) principles by democratizing personal genomic insights through open-source technology (GitHub).
